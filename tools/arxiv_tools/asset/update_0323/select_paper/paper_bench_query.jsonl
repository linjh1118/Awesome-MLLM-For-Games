Departing from pre-\nvious benchmarks focusing on simplistic tasks\nand individual model capability, PCA-Bench in-\ntroduces three complex scenarios: autonomous\ndriving, domestic robotics, and open-world\ngames. Given task instructions and diverse con-\ntexts, the model is required to seamlessly inte-\ngrate multiple capabilities of Perception, Cog-\nnition, and Action in a reasoning chain to make\naccurate decisions. Moreover, PCA-Bench fea-\ntures error localization capabilities, scrutinizing\nmodel inaccuracies in areas such as perception,\nknowledge, or reasoning. This enhances the\nreliability of deploying MLLMs. To balance\naccuracy and efficiency in evaluation, we pro-\npose PCA-Eval, an automatic evaluation pro-\ntocol, and assess 10 prevalent MLLMs. The\nresults reveal significant performance dispari-\nties between open-source models and powerful\nproprietary models like GPT-4 Vision. To ad-\ndress this, we introduce Embodied-Instruction-\nEvolution (EIE), an automatic framework for\nsynthesizing instruction tuning examples in\nmultimodal embodied environments. EIE gen-\nerates 7,510 training examples in PCA-Bench\nand enhances the performance of open-source\nMLLMs, occasionally surpassing GPT-4 Vi-\nsion (+3% in decision accuracy), thereby val-\nidating the effectiveness of EIE. Our findings\nsuggest that robust MLLMs like GPT4-Vision\nshow promise for decision-making in embod-\nied agents, opening new avenues for MLLM\nresearch.\n1\nIntroduction\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\nhave demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tack-\nling complex tasks that necessitate a chain of in-\ntegrated skills, including visual perception, world\nknowledge, reasoning, action, and more (OpenAI,\nYou are a driving assistant.  Based on current image, \nwhat should you do if you want to drive forward safely?\nA. Slow down \nB. Keep driving \nC.

While\nsome benchmarks like MMMU (Yue et al., 2023)\nand MathVista (Lu et al., 2023a) require abilities\nfrom both the vision and language part, they lack\nerror localization techniques beyond accuracy as-\nsessments. This complicates identifying which part\nof the MLLM malfunctioned when making mis-\ntakes—whether it was the visual or the language\ncomponent—and determines which aspect requires\nenhancement to enhance overall performance.\nTo address the challenges of insufficient inte-\ngrated benchmarking and error localization prob-\nlems, we introduce PCA-Bench. It arises with\narXiv:2402.15527v1  [cs.CL]  21 Feb 2024\nMLLM’s applications in embodied AI and decision\nmaking, where models called agents need to first\nprocess multimodal observation from different en-\nvironments, reason with the current situation and\ngoal, and finally make an action from a given ac-\ntion space. The abilities in the complex decision\nmaking process can be abstracted to Perception,\nCognition and Action according to the Perception-\nAction loop (Fuster, 2004) in Cognitive Science, a\nfundamental concept that describes how organisms\nprocess sensory information to interact with their\nenvironment through actions, offering a compre-\nhensive framework for assessment. Figure 1 shows\nhow MLLMs make decisions in the PCA chain.\nThe instances in PCA-Bench are from three in-\nfluential domains in embodied decision-making:\nautonomous driving, domestic robotics, and open-\nworld gaming. As shown in Figure 2, each in-\nstance is annotated by human annotators with a\n6-element tuple: <image, question, action candi-\ndates, answer, reason, key concept>. The last three\nelements serve as anchors for error localization for\nAction, Cognition and Perception, correspondingly.\nPCA-Eval is an anchor-based evaluation pro-\ntocol, designed to automatically conduct error lo-\ncalization utilizing the powerful semantic parsing\nability of LLMs and the anchor information in data\nannotation. In the past, such localization was both\nlabor-intensive and time-consuming. PCA-Eval\nwith strong LLMs like GPT4 demonstrates a strong\nkappa correlation with human assessments, reach-\ning 0.8+ average kappa coefficients for perception,\ncognition, and action scores. The anchor-based\nevaluation provides the LLMs with groundtruth\nanswers for each sub-score, preventing the sys-\ntematic bias of LLM evaluators, such as position\nbias (Wang et al., 2023b; Zheng et al., 2023) in\nthe pair-wise evaluation and verbosity bias (Zheng\net al., 2023) in simple preference evaluation. We\nalso compared open state-of-the-art LLMs in PCA-\nEval. Though they lag behind close ones in align-\nment with human assessments, we see large im-\nprovement when the model scales up. We believe\nthat with specific training for error localization and\nimproved general ability of open LLMs in the fu-\nture, they would be more suitable evaluation tools\nfor the reproducible and transparent characteristics.\nAiming at scaling up PCA-Bench, using LLM\nto synthesize training examples is an increasingly\npopular method for enhancing models without ad-\nditional human involvement. We expand this ap-\nproach to generate more samples following the\nFigure 2: Instances of PCA-Bench in 3 domains.\nPCA guideline. Unlike text-based instruction gen-\neration methods like Self-Instruct (Wang et al.,\n2023c), generating instructions in embodied envi-\nronments poses distinct challenges. It demands not\nonly the creation of textual instructions but also the\ngeneration of corresponding precise observations.\nTo address these challenges, we propose Embod-\nied Instruction Evolution (EIE), which integrates\nexternal environments with LLMs, thereby extend-\ning the LLMs’ ability to data synthesize across\nvarious embodied environments, contributing to\n7,510 training data in PCA-Bench.\nWe conduct comprehensive experiments and\nanalysis on PCA-Bench, our findings are summa-\nrized as follows:\n1. Visual perception and reasoning with world\nknowledge are two core abilities for an MLLM\nto make correct decisions in PCA-Bench. GPT4-\nVision shows strong zero-shot cross-modal reason-\ning ability for embodied decision-making tasks,\nsurpassing open-source MLLMs and even Tool-\nUsing LLM-agent.\n2. EIE could generate training samples signifi-\ncantly enhancing the performance of open-source\nMLLMs (surpassing GPT-4V at some scores), vali-\ndating the effectiveness of the method.\n3.\nPCA-Eval serves as a good error locator.\nAbove the high average kappa coefficient (0.8+)\nwith human assessments and its ability to pinpoint\nthe error source, it can effectively distinguishes\nwhether a model’s correct decisions are fluky or\nthrough genuine understanding. This leads to a bet-\nter ensemble metric for MLLM evaluation named\nGenuine PCA Score.\n2\nPCA-Bench\n2.1\nProblem Definition\nMultimodal decision-making problems are com-\nmonly formalized with a partially observable\nMarkov decision process. For MLLMs F tested in\nPCA-Bench, we care about given the multi-modal\nobservation o ∈O, the goal description g, a subset\nof candidates actions AC ⊆A, whether the model\ncould make correct action a ∈AC and give proper\nreasoning process r.\nF(g, o, AC) = (a, r)\n(1)\nAs shown in Figure 2, each instance in the bench-\nmark is a 6-element tuple: <image, question, ac-\ntion candidates, answer, reason, key concept>.\nThe image is collected from various embodied en-\nvironments, including transportation scenes, house-\nkeeper environments, and Minecraft. Questions,\naction candidates, and answers are derived from\nreal tasks within the corresponding environment.\nThe reasons explain why the answer is the best\nchoice for the current image, while the key concept\nhighlights the most question-related aspect of the\nimage.\nUnlike traditional visual question-answering\ndatasets that emphasize visual perception (e.g.,\nVQA (Goyal et al., 2017)) or visual reasoning\n(e.g., NLVR (Suhr et al., 2017)), PCA-Bench man-\ndates accurate observation perception, complex\ntask decomposition, and understanding the out-\ncomes of various actions simultaneously. Com-\npared to embodied simulation environments such as\nALFRED (Shridhar et al., 2020) and Minedojo (Fan\net al., 2022), PCA-Bench stands out for its focus\non high-level actions, proving to be more effec-\ntive for evaluating MLLMs. This is because high-\nlevel actions, which can be readily translated or\nprogrammed into low-level actions within their re-\nspective domains, are inherently more accessible\nto LLMs. The high-level actions are more compre-\nhensible for LLMs than the direct low-level actions\nlike action vectors in the simulation environments\nbecause (1) the high-level actions are in the form\nof natural languages, making it easier for LLMs\nto understand the meaning and connect with world\nknowledge. (2) LLMs are not grounded with low-\nlevel actions during the pretraining or finetuning\nstage, making it hard for LLMs to understand the\nconsequences of executing an action.\nTo answer a question in PCA-Bench, the agent\nmust possess the following abilities: (1) Percep-\ntion: Accurately identify the concept related to\nthe question within the image; (2) Cognition: En-\ngage in reasoning based on image perception and\nworldly knowledge; (3) Action: Comprehend the\npotential actions, selecting the one that best aligns\nwith the outcome of the reasoning process. A de-\nficiency in any of these abilities would possibly\nresult in an incorrect answer, posing a significant\nchallenge to the more integrated capabilities of\nMLLMs.\n2.2\nPCA-Eval\nFor each instance, we prompt the model to deliver\nan answer comprising a reasoning process r, and\na final action a, represented as < r, a >. By com-\nparing the model prediction with the ground truth\nanswer, we can obtain a fine-grained diagnosis of\nthe decision making process as follows:\nPerception Score (P-Score) measures the model’s\naccuracy in perceiving the observation. It is com-\nputed based on whether the agent’s reasoning pro-\ncess r includes the key concept of the instance. A\nscore of 1 is assigned if at least one question-related\nkey concept is described by the agent; otherwise,\nit is 0. For the top example in Figure 2, the agent\nshould output “clear road” or “no car visible” or\nother semantically equivalent concepts in its de-\nscription of the image to get the perception score.\nParsing the model’s output and determining\nwhether it entails the key concept using shallow\nfeatures of the sentence is not trivial. We leverage\nLLM to conduct entailment detection, which turns\nout to have a high alignment with human judgment.\nCognition Score (C-Score) assesses the model’s\nability to reason, comprehend, and make informed\ndecisions based on the perceived input data and\nworld knowledge. The score is 1 if the reasoning\nprocess is correct, otherwise the score is 0. For\nthe instance in Figure 2, the agent should link the\n“clear road” to the action “keep driving” based on\ntransportation commonsense to get the score.\nAction Score (A-Score) measures the model’s abil-\nity to generate appropriate and effective responses\nor actions based on the perceived input data and\nthe cognitive understanding of the context. The\nscore is assigned a value of 1 if the agent selects\nthe correct action; otherwise, the score is set to 0.\n2.3\nAutomatic Evaluation\nRecent advancements have seen researchers har-\nnessing powerful LLMs for the evaluation of the\noutput of language models. Studies have revealed\nthat the outcomes from LLMs could exhibit re-\nmarkable alignment with human judgments (Zheng\net al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b,a). In our investiga-\ntion, we employed GPT-4 to automatically evaluate\nperception, cognition, and action scores based on\nthe model’s outputs. Our findings underscore a\nsignificant agreement between GPT-4 scoring and\nhuman evaluation results. This is substantiated by\nCohen-Kappa coefficients of 0.71, 0.82, and 0.94\nfor perception, cognition, and action evaluations,\nrespectively. Experiments of human evaluation and\ncomparison of open LLMs are in section 4.1. For a\ndetailed description of our evaluation tool, kindly\nrefer to Appendix D.\n2.4\nBenchmark Dataset Overview\nFor the test set, the examples are written by 3 hu-\nman experts for each domain. There are no over-\nlapped environmental observations between the\ntraining and test sets. The details of the human\nannotation pipeline can be found in Appendix B.\nWe introduce the three domains encompassed by\nour dataset as follows:\nAutonomous Driving.\nIn the autonomous driv-\ning domain, instances are derived from real-world\ntransportation scenes, which requires the agent to\nhave particular abilities such as traffic sign recogni-\ntion, obstacle detection, and decision-making at in-\ntersections. The dataset aims to evaluate an agent’s\nability to perceive and interpret visual informa-\ntion while making safe and efficient driving deci-\nsions. The images are collected from TT100K (Zhu\net al., 2016) dataset and annotators are instructed\nto propose an image-conditioned question that is\ngrounded with real actions of vehicles.\nDomestic Robot.\nThe domestic assistance do-\nmain features instances from the ALFRED (Shrid-\nhar et al., 2020; Kolve et al., 2017) environment,\nwhich simulates a housekeeper robot performing\ntasks within a household setting. These tasks may\ninclude object manipulation, navigation, and inter-\naction with various appliances. The environment\nassesses an agent’s ability to understand and exe-\ncute complex instructions while navigating and in-\nteracting with a dynamic environment. Annotators\nare asked to select one image from the randomly\ngenerated scenes in the environment, propose a\nquestion related to the items on the scene, and an-\nnotate the full information of the instance.\nTopology Graph: Harvest beef using iron sword\nCraft 2 Iron Ingot\nCollect 2 Wood\nCraft 1 Stick\nFind a Cow\nKill a Cow\nCraft an Iron Sword\nCollect 2 Iron Ore\nFigure 3: Illustration of task topology graph. Events in\ngreen represent the leaf nodes of the graph.\nOpen-World Game.\nIn the open-world game do-\nmain, instances are sourced from the Minecraft en-\nvironment, where agents are tasked with exploring,\ncrafting, and surviving in a procedurally generated\nworld. This dataset evaluates an agent’s ability to\nreason and plan actions within a complex, open-\nended environment, which often requires long-term\nstrategizing and adaptability. Annotators receive\npredefined tasks from MineDojo (Fan et al., 2022)\nas a reference during the task generation phase. For\neach task, we instruct the annotator to sketch a task\ntopology graph, exemplified in Figure 3. The task\nshould be completed under the topological order of\nthe graph, where the event located in the leaf nodes\nshould be finished first. Each node in the task topol-\nogy graph can be viewed as a step in the sequential\ndecision. We list the in-domain task distribution in\nAppendix A.\n2.5\nEmbodied Instruction Evolution\nThe PCA-Bench benchmark also includes subset\nof automatic generated samples by Embodied In-\nstruction Evolution(EIE), which is used as training\nset in our experiment.\nThe annotation of PCA-Bench examples is a\nlabor-intensive task. As illustrated in Figure 4, we\nintroduce Embodied Instruction Evolution (EIE),\na method for automatically augmenting examples\nin the PCA-Bench format using Large Language\nModels, such as ChatGPT. This process involves\nfour key steps:\n1) Setup of Programmable Interface: Estab-\nlish a programmable interface with a corresponding\ntemplate, ensuring that observations in the embod-\nied environment can be generated based on specific\nparameters.\n2) Generation of Seed Tasks: Create initial\nseed tasks for each environment. These tasks are\nrepresentative of the general challenges an agent\nFigure 4: Pipeline of the Embodied Instruction Evolution method.\nmight encounter. We provide ChatGPT with sam-\nple tasks and enable it to generate additional seed\ntasks.\n3) Task Specification and Template Filling:\nFor each seed task, we instruct ChatGPT to break\ndown the task into multiple subtasks, following its\nevent topology graph (as seen in Figure 3). This\napproach mimics the multi-step decision-making\nprocess. After determining the subtask names, we\nuse the LLM to populate the environment parame-\nter templates created in Step 1 for each subtask.\n4) Observation Generation and Filtering:\nGenerate observations for the environment and im-\nplement an automatic process to filter out invalid\ninstances. The filled templates may contain er-\nrors, such as incorrect creature names or impos-\nsible items, leading to errors during environment\ncreation. When such errors occur, the affected tem-\nplates are automatically filtered out. For domains\nwithout programmable environments (autonomous\ndriving), step 1 and step 4 are not needed, we col-\nlect real traffic images and utilize GPT4-Vision to\ngenerate seed task based on the image content.\nEIE leverages the capabilities of Large Language\nModels to reduce manual labor and improve the\ndiversity and scalability of PCA-Bench.\n3\nExperiments\n3.1\nTracks\nZero Shot End-to-End.\nThe test set of PCA-\nBench serves as an effective tool for comparing\nthe embodied decision-making and cross-modal\nreasoning capabilities of various Multimodal Lan-\nguage Learning Models (MLLMs). In this evalu-\nation, the same images and prompts are provided\nto each model under test. Additionally, to address\nthe challenge of perceiving certain non-visual in-\nformation from images, details such as “items in\nhand” and “items in inventory”, particularly rele-\nvant in domestic and gaming domains, are directly\nincluded in the question prompts.\nIn our analysis, we benchmark the performance\nof the most recently open-sourced models, includ-\ning LLaVA1.5 and Qwen-VL-Chat, as well as the\nAPI-only GPT4-V model. All models are evalu-\nated using their default inference configurations to\nensure a fair and standardized comparison.\nFinetuning with EIE.\nIn this track, we extend\nthe capabilities of open-source MLLMs by fine-\ntuning them with the training set generated through\nour Embodied Instruction Evolution (EIE) method.\nAfter the fine-tuning process, these trained models\nare subjected to the test set of PCA-Bench. We\nfinetune the LLaVA-7b\/13b, MMICL and Qwen-\nVL-Chat models on the training set for 5 epochs.\nThe training details are in Appendix E.\nZero Shot Modality Conversion.\nIn this track,\nwe introduce and compare a new baseline, termed\nHOLMES, which utilizes LLM without multi-\nmodal perception capabilities. Instead, HOLMES\nrelies on modality conversion APIs for embodied\ndecision-making processes. Within the HOLMES\nframework, the LLM must continuously invoke\nvarious APIs, retrieving and processing return in-\nformation about the environment. The HOLMES\nmethod is illustrated in Figure 7 from Appendix.\nModel\nSize\nTraffic\nDomestic\nGame\nAverage\nP\nC\nA\nP\nC\nA\nP\nC\nA\nP\nC\nA\nMiniGPT4 (Zhu et al., 2023)†\n7B\n0.45\n0.37\n0.48\n0.81\n0.38\n0.38\n0.38\n0.14\n0.27\n0.55\n0.30\n0.38\nLLaVA1.5 (Liu et al., 2023b)†\n7B\n0.44\n0.44\n0.53\n0.92\n0.48\n0.44\n0.8\n0.35\n0.39\n0.72\n0.42\n0.45\nQwen-VL-Chat (Bai et al., 2023)†\n7B\n0.53\n0.36\n0.62\n0.77\n0.41\n0.44\n0.39\n0.18\n0.25\n0.56\n0.33\n0.44\nMiniGPT4 (Zhu et al., 2023)†\n13B\n0.41\n0.37\n0.5\n0.85\n0.35\n0.33\n0.41\n0.22\n0.33\n0.56\n0.31\n0.39\nInstructBLIP (Dai et al., 2023b)†\n13B\n0.36\n0.41\n0.42\n0.90\n0.44\n0.39\n0.33\n0.25\n0.24\n0.53\n0.37\n0.35\nMMICL (Zhao et al., 2023)†\n13B\n0.31\n0.49\n0.47\n0.81\n0.3\n0.33\n0.41\n0.18\n0.27\n0.51\n0.32\n0.36\nSPHINX-v1 (Lin et al., 2023)†\n13B\n0.46\n0.48\n0.61\n0.95\n0.55\n0.31\n0.71\n0.35\n0.43\n0.71\n0.46\n0.45\nLLaVA1.5 (Liu et al., 2023b)†\n13B\n0.49\n0.56\n0.61\n0.95\n0.62\n0.46\n0.74\n0.45\n0.51\n0.73\n0.54\n0.53\nQwen-VL-Chat-PLUS (Bai et al., 2023)‡\nUNK\n0.57\n0.56\n0.65\n0.86\n0.44\n0.43\n0.68\n0.47\n0.49\n0.70\n0.49\n0.52\nGPT-4V (OpenAI, 2023)‡\nUNK\n0.73\n0.72\n0.74\n0.96\n0.66\n0.62\n0.88\n0.72\n0.69\n0.86\n0.7\n0.68\nTable 1: Zero Shot results on the full test set of PCA-Bench.

Results of LLavA1.5-13B and MMICL are in Figure 13 from appendix.\nWe evaluate two LLMs in this track: ChatGPT-\n3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-0613, comparing their per-\nformances against the advanced GPT-4-Vision.

Among\nall MLLMs, GPT4-V, outperforms existing open-\nsource models by achieving the highest scores of\n0.86, 0.7, and 0.68 in the perception, cognition, and\naction dimensions respectively. This performance\nrepresents a 15% action score improvement over\nits strongest open-source counterpart, LLaVA1.5-\n13B. The impressive performance of GPT4-V is\nprimarily attributed to its exceptional ability to per-\nceive visual information across different domains\nand the world knowledge in the language model,\nparticularly in the challenging game domain.\nImpact of Finetuning with EIE.\nThe results of\nthe fine-tuning track are illustrated in Figure 5. Our\nEIE method has been found to significantly en-\nhance the general decision-making abilities of vari-\nous models, encompassing perception, cognition,\nand action. Notably, it has led to an average in-\ncrease of 0.24 and 0.19 in action scores for the\nLLaVA1.5-7b and Qwen-VL-Chat models, respec-\ntively. Results for LLaVA1.5-13b and MMICL are\nillustrated in Figure 13, also showing improved\nperformance when trained with EIE. We note that\nthere exist reasoning or perception errors in some\nof the generated sample due to the hallucination\nproblem of LLM generated content, however they\ndo not influence the overall performance. In some\ncases, these sub-scores have matched or even sur-\npassed those of the GPT4-V model, demonstrating\nthe potential of the EIE to scale up and apply to\ndifferent environments.\nComparison Between End-to-End and Modality\nConversion Method\nIn the zero-shot modality\nconversion track, we conduct an analysis and com-\nparison of the outputs generated by the End2End\nMethod\nModel\nTraffic\nDomestic\nGame\nAverage\nP\nC\nA\nP\nC\nA\nP\nC\nA\nP\nC\nA\nEnd-to-End\nGPT-4V\n0.75\n0.73\n0.78\n0.81\n0.69\n0.67\n0.95\n0.79\n0.77\n0.84\n0.74\n0.74\nHOLMES\nChatGPT\n0.75\n0.68\n0.66\n0.88\n0.52\n0.50\n0.78\n0.40\n0.36\n0.80\n0.53\n0.51\nGPT4\n0.87\n0.82\n0.82\n0.85\n0.61\n0.56\n0.91\n0.77\n0.74\n0.88\n0.73\n0.71\nTable 2: Comparison between End-to-End (MLLM) and HOLMES (LLM+API) methods on a subset of PCA-Bench\nwith API annotation.\nmethod with GPT4-V, as well as the HOLMES\nmethod with GPT4 and ChatGPT-3.5 in Table 2.\nThe results show that the HOLMES system\nbased on GPT4 achieves 0.71 Action Score, which\nis on par with GPT4-V’s performance (0.74). This\nindicates that, overall, the HOLMES system is able\nto accurately understand the task goal, split the\nlarger goal into multiple smaller steps, and cor-\nrectly invoke the relevant APIs to accomplish each\nstep.

However, compared to End2End methods,\nHOLMES relies on multi-step reasoning for the\nfinal decision, in which reasoning errors tend to\naccumulate, and thus achieves a lower Cognition\nScore in both Domestic and Game domains.\nOn the other hand, we also find that the End2End\nmethod effectively mitigates information loss dur-\ning the modality conversion process. As illustrated\nin Figure 8 from Appendix, an image depicts a\nroad with several nearby cars. GPT4-V is capable\nof discerning that the street is not crowded, thereby\nsuggesting that the driver can continue driving.\nConversely, GPT4-HOLMES, while being aware\nof the number of cars, lacks information about their\nspatial relation, leading it to recommend slowing\ndown because of the existence of 14 cars. This\nsuggests that the End2End method is superior in\nperceiving certain visual features that are not cap-\ntured by the APIs. Conversely, some specialized\nAPIs, such as traffic sign detection, outperform\nGPT4-V in tasks like traffic sign detection, as they\nare specifically trained for this task. This could en-\nable the HOLMES method to gather more accurate\ninformation than the End2End model.\nEvaluator Model\nKappa Coefficients\nP\nC\nA\nGPT4†\n0.71\n0.82\n0.94\nQwen1.5-72B-Chat†\n0.30\n0.49\n0.60\nQwen1.5-14B-Chat†\n0.16\n0.24\n0.16\nQwen1.5-7B-Chat†\n0.20\n0.11\n0.06\nTable 3: Comparison of Open† and Close† LLMs as\nEvaluators. Kappa coefficients of Qwens increase when\nthe model scales up.\n4\nDiscussion\n4.1\nStrong LLMs are Good Error Locators.\nAs shown in Table 3, we compare the scoring kappa\ncoefficients with human assessments for different\nLLMs. We randomly select 300 model outputs\nequally from different domains and ask 3 human\nexperts to give perception, cognition, and action\nscores. The final result is based on the majority\nof three annotators. The result underscores a sig-\nnificant agreement between GPT-4 scoring and hu-\nman evaluation results. This is substantiated by\nCohen-Kappa coefficients of 0.71, 0.82, and 0.94\nfor perception, cognition, and action evaluations.\nWe also compare open models as evaluators.\nWe choose one of the best open LLMs, Qwen1.51\nseries from 7B, 14B to 72B version. Currently\nopen LLMs tend to give wrongly high judgments in\nall sub-scores. Although currently trailing behind\nGPT-4 in performance, we anticipate that with tar-\ngeted training focused on error identification and\nenhancements in the overall capabilities of open\nLLMs, these models will become more effective\nevaluation tools compared to closed models. This\nis primarily due to the reproducible and transpar-\nent nature of open models, which offer significant\nadvantages in the development of evaluation tools.\n1https:\/\/huggingface.co\/collections\/Qwen\n4.2\nGenuine PCA Score\nPCA-Eval could pinpoint cases where the MLLM\ngets the correct answer by a fluke where perception\nor cognition score is 0 but the action score is 1. It\nexplains why for some models, the action score is\nhigher than perception and cognition scores. For in-\nstance, a model might opt for a conservative action,\nsuch as slowing down, even without accurately rec-\nognizing snowy weather in the image, resulting in\na fluky correct action. In another scenario, if the\nmodel exhibits a preference for a specific choice\nindex, it will attain a high action score provided\nthat the evaluation dataset contains a substantial\nnumber of correct choices matching the preferred\nindex, a phenomenon attributable to the positional\nbiases inherent in both the model and the dataset.\nTo overcome the mentioned bias when evaluating\nthe genuine ability of MLLM, we propose a new\nmetric Genuine PCA Score. It is equal to one\nif the perception, cogntion and action scores are\nall 1 for one model’s response to a question. We\nfind that for all models, there exists significant gap\n(>10%) between the action score and genuine PCA\nscore in average, revealing that relying on single\nmetric such as choice accuracy is very problematic\nwhen conducting model evaluation. In our online\nleaderboard, both average action score and average\ngenuine PCA score are considered when ranking\nthe candidate models.\n4.3\nAlignment between Agent Decisions and\nHuman Values\nWe have observed instances where the decisions\nmade by the agent contradict human values. Con-\nsider the scenario depicted in Figure 9 from Ap-\npendix. The image illustrates a crosswalk with-\nout pedestrians. The appropriate response would\nbe slowing down, as caution is paramount when\napproaching a crosswalk, regardless of the pres-\nence or absence of pedestrians. However, upon\nprocessing the information that the crosswalk is\nempty, ChatGPT suggests that maintaining the cur-\nrent speed is the optimal action, arguing that the\nabsence of pedestrians eliminates the need to slow\ndown. The rationale provided by ChatGPT is logi-\ncal, yet it does not align with human values.\n5\nRelated Work\nMLLM Benchmark.\nIn recent times, there\nhave been several benchmarks built for evaluating\nMLLMs, such as MMBench, MME, Seed-Bench,\nPOPE (Liu et al., 2023e; Fu et al., 2023; Li et al.,\n2023a,e) that assess MLLMs performance from\nmultiple fine-grained dimensions.\nVisit-Bench,\nLVLM-eHub, M3IT (Bitton et al., 2023; Xu et al.,\n2023; Li et al., 2023c) focus on the general in-\nstruction following ability. General VQA tasks\nlike OKVQA, VQAv2, Vizwiz, ScienceQA, VSR\nand IconQA (Marino et al., 2019; Agrawal et al.,\n2015; Gurari et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2022; Liu et al.,\n2023a; Lu et al., 2021) focus on visual understand-\ning. MMMU, MathVista, LLaVA-benchmark and\nMM-Vet (Yue et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2023a; Liu\net al., 2023c; Yu et al., 2023) require abilities from\nthe vision part and specific knowledge in the lan-\nguage part. A lack of error localization techniques\nbeyond accuracy assessments is among current\nbenchmarks. This complicates identifying which\npart of the MLLM malfunctioned when making\nmistakes. Unlike prior work, PCA-Bench is more\nrelevant to evaluate MLLMs’ ability to utilize inte-\ngrated abilities to solve one task and make explain-\nable decisions via error localization.\nLLM Agent and Embodied Decision Making.\nUsing LLMs to empower the AI agents (Xi et al.,\n2023; Liu et al., 2023d; Park et al., 2023; Wang\net al., 2023d) becomes more and more promis-\ning. Specifically, we can employ LLMs to enhance\nthe decision making ability of the agents (Nakano\net al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023d;\nSong et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b), expanding\ntheir perception and action space through strate-\ngies like tool utilization (Schick et al., 2023; Qin\net al., 2023; Lu et al., 2023b). This line of research\ndivides the entire decision-making process into two\nphases: (1) information seeking, usually involving\nMLLMs to verbalize the current status of AI agents\nin the vision-based environment with natural lan-\nguage; (2) reasoning and planning with text-based\nLLMs to decide what the AI agent should do in\nthe next step with textual clues. Although LLM-\nbased agents demonstrate reasoning and planning\nabilities through techniques like Chain of Thought\nor problem decomposition (Wei et al., 2023; Yao\net al., 2023; Kojima et al., 2022), they inherently\nlack visual perception, and are limited to the dis-\ncrete textual content. Therefore, integrating mul-\ntimodal information can offer agents a broader\ncontext and a more precise understanding, such\nas PaLM-E (Driess et al., 2023), enhancing their\nenvironmental perception. However, there is still\nlarge gap deploying MLLM in various embodied\nenvironments due to the lack of appropriate bench-\nmark and interface linking those two domains while\nPCA-Bench is an attempt towards that goal.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we introduce PCA-Bench, a mul-\ntimodal benchmark designed to assess the inte-\ngrated decision-making capabilities of MLLMs.\nThis benchmark features PCA-EVAL, a novel fine-\ngrained automatic evaluation tool that diagnoses\ndecision making processes from three critical per-\nspectives: perception, cognition, and action. To\nenhance the decision making ability from data per-\nspective, we propose the Embodied Instruction Evo-\nlution method to automatically synthesize instruc-\ntion examples from different environments, which\nhas been proven effective in our main experiments.\nWe believe that powerful MLLMs pave a new and\npromising way toward decision making in embod-\nied environments and we hope PCA-Bench could\nserve as a good benchmark in evaluation and error\nlocalization for MLLMs’ development.\n7\nLimitations\nThe current scope of PCA-Bench is confined to\nmerely three domains in static environments. One\nof our future works aims to broaden this scope\nto encompass more domains and dynamic embod-\nied environments where MLLMs could keep get-\nting feedback, which is closer to real embodied\nAI scenarios.\nWe do not apply different infer-\nence enhancement methods like In-Context Learn-\ning and Reflection in the decision making process\nof MLLMs. We just use the simplest prompting\nmethod and leave the exploration of a better cross-\nmodal Chain-of-Thought method for future studies.\nCurrently, PCA-Eval shows the best consistency\nwith human evaluators when using powerful close\nLLM GPT4, which would bring additional cost to\nthe user of PCA-Eval. We plan to develop and re-\nlease an open error locator for error localization in\nthe benchmark in the future.","pdf_path":"tools\/arxiv_tools\/asset\/pdf\/\/PCA-Bench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models in Perception-Cognition-Action Chain.pdf","query_prompt":"### 任务\n你是一个人工智能领域的专家，你能够快速阅读arxiv上的各种AI前沿论文和相关博客，进而完美地回答学生的问题。\n现在请你阅读以下论文及博客，并回答学生的问题。\n\n### 论文信息\n###  1. 论文标题\n```\nPCA-Bench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models in Perception-Cognition-Action Chain\n```\n#### 2. 论文摘要\n```\nWe present PCA-Bench, a multimodal decision-making benchmark for evaluating\nthe integrated capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).\nDeparting from previous benchmarks focusing on simplistic tasks and individual\nmodel capability, PCA-Bench introduces three complex scenarios: autonomous\ndriving, domestic robotics, and open-world games.

While\nsome benchmarks like MMMU (Yue et al., 2023)\nand MathVista (Lu et al., 2023a) require abilities\nfrom both the vision and language part, they lack\nerror localization techniques beyond accuracy as-\nsessments. This complicates identifying which part\nof the MLLM malfunctioned when making mis-\ntakes—whether it was the visual or the language\ncomponent—and determines which aspect requires\nenhancement to enhance overall performance.\nTo address the challenges of insufficient inte-\ngrated benchmarking and error localization prob-\nlems, we introduce PCA-Bench. It arises with\narXiv:2402.15527v1  [cs.CL]  21 Feb 2024\nMLLM’s applications in embodied AI and decision\nmaking, where models called agents need to first\nprocess multimodal observation from different en-\nvironments, reason with the current situation and\ngoal, and finally make an action from a given ac-\ntion space. The abilities in the complex decision\nmaking process can be abstracted to Perception,\nCognition and Action according to the Perception-\nAction loop (Fuster, 2004) in Cognitive Science, a\nfundamental concept that describes how organisms\nprocess sensory information to interact with their\nenvironment through actions, offering a compre-\nhensive framework for assessment. Figure 1 shows\nhow MLLMs make decisions in the PCA chain.\nThe instances in PCA-Bench are from three in-\nfluential domains in embodied decision-making:\nautonomous driving, domestic robotics, and open-\nworld gaming. As shown in Figure 2, each in-\nstance is annotated by human annotators with a\n6-element tuple: <image, question, action candi-\ndates, answer, reason, key concept>. The last three\nelements serve as anchors for error localization for\nAction, Cognition and Perception, correspondingly.\nPCA-Eval is an anchor-based evaluation pro-\ntocol, designed to automatically conduct error lo-\ncalization utilizing the powerful semantic parsing\nability of LLMs and the anchor information in data\nannotation. In the past, such localization was both\nlabor-intensive and time-consuming. PCA-Eval\nwith strong LLMs like GPT4 demonstrates a strong\nkappa correlation with human assessments, reach-\ning 0.8+ average kappa coefficients for perception,\ncognition, and action scores. The anchor-based\nevaluation provides the LLMs with groundtruth\nanswers for each sub-score, preventing the sys-\ntematic bias of LLM evaluators, such as position\nbias (Wang et al., 2023b; Zheng et al., 2023) in\nthe pair-wise evaluation and verbosity bias (Zheng\net al., 2023) in simple preference evaluation. We\nalso compared open state-of-the-art LLMs in PCA-\nEval. Though they lag behind close ones in align-\nment with human assessments, we see large im-\nprovement when the model scales up. We believe\nthat with specific training for error localization and\nimproved general ability of open LLMs in the fu-\nture, they would be more suitable evaluation tools\nfor the reproducible and transparent characteristics.\nAiming at scaling up PCA-Bench, using LLM\nto synthesize training examples is an increasingly\npopular method for enhancing models without ad-\nditional human involvement. We expand this ap-\nproach to generate more samples following the\nFigure 2: Instances of PCA-Bench in 3 domains.\nPCA guideline. Unlike text-based instruction gen-\neration methods like Self-Instruct (Wang et al.,\n2023c), generating instructions in embodied envi-\nronments poses distinct challenges. It demands not\nonly the creation of textual instructions but also the\ngeneration of corresponding precise observations.\nTo address these challenges, we propose Embod-\nied Instruction Evolution (EIE), which integrates\nexternal environments with LLMs, thereby extend-\ning the LLMs’ ability to data synthesize across\nvarious embodied environments, contributing to\n7,510 training data in PCA-Bench.\nWe conduct comprehensive experiments and\nanalysis on PCA-Bench, our findings are summa-\nrized as follows:\n1. Visual perception and reasoning with world\nknowledge are two core abilities for an MLLM\nto make correct decisions in PCA-Bench. GPT4-\nVision shows strong zero-shot cross-modal reason-\ning ability for embodied decision-making tasks,\nsurpassing open-source MLLMs and even Tool-\nUsing LLM-agent.\n2. EIE could generate training samples signifi-\ncantly enhancing the performance of open-source\nMLLMs (surpassing GPT-4V at some scores), vali-\ndating the effectiveness of the method.\n3.\nPCA-Eval serves as a good error locator.\nAbove the high average kappa coefficient (0.8+)\nwith human assessments and its ability to pinpoint\nthe error source, it can effectively distinguishes\nwhether a model’s correct decisions are fluky or\nthrough genuine understanding. This leads to a bet-\nter ensemble metric for MLLM evaluation named\nGenuine PCA Score.\n2\nPCA-Bench\n2.1\nProblem Definition\nMultimodal decision-making problems are com-\nmonly formalized with a partially observable\nMarkov decision process. For MLLMs F tested in\nPCA-Bench, we care about given the multi-modal\nobservation o ∈O, the goal description g, a subset\nof candidates actions AC ⊆A, whether the model\ncould make correct action a ∈AC and give proper\nreasoning process r.\nF(g, o, AC) = (a, r)\n(1)\nAs shown in Figure 2, each instance in the bench-\nmark is a 6-element tuple: <image, question, ac-\ntion candidates, answer, reason, key concept>.\nThe image is collected from various embodied en-\nvironments, including transportation scenes, house-\nkeeper environments, and Minecraft. Questions,\naction candidates, and answers are derived from\nreal tasks within the corresponding environment.\nThe reasons explain why the answer is the best\nchoice for the current image, while the key concept\nhighlights the most question-related aspect of the\nimage.\nUnlike traditional visual question-answering\ndatasets that emphasize visual perception (e.g.,\nVQA (Goyal et al., 2017)) or visual reasoning\n(e.g., NLVR (Suhr et al., 2017)), PCA-Bench man-\ndates accurate observation perception, complex\ntask decomposition, and understanding the out-\ncomes of various actions simultaneously. Com-\npared to embodied simulation environments such as\nALFRED (Shridhar et al., 2020) and Minedojo (Fan\net al., 2022), PCA-Bench stands out for its focus\non high-level actions, proving to be more effec-\ntive for evaluating MLLMs. This is because high-\nlevel actions, which can be readily translated or\nprogrammed into low-level actions within their re-\nspective domains, are inherently more accessible\nto LLMs. The high-level actions are more compre-\nhensible for LLMs than the direct low-level actions\nlike action vectors in the simulation environments\nbecause (1) the high-level actions are in the form\nof natural languages, making it easier for LLMs\nto understand the meaning and connect with world\nknowledge. (2) LLMs are not grounded with low-\nlevel actions during the pretraining or finetuning\nstage, making it hard for LLMs to understand the\nconsequences of executing an action.\nTo answer a question in PCA-Bench, the agent\nmust possess the following abilities: (1) Percep-\ntion: Accurately identify the concept related to\nthe question within the image; (2) Cognition: En-\ngage in reasoning based on image perception and\nworldly knowledge; (3) Action: Comprehend the\npotential actions, selecting the one that best aligns\nwith the outcome of the reasoning process. A de-\nficiency in any of these abilities would possibly\nresult in an incorrect answer, posing a significant\nchallenge to the more integrated capabilities of\nMLLMs.\n2.2\nPCA-Eval\nFor each instance, we prompt the model to deliver\nan answer comprising a reasoning process r, and\na final action a, represented as < r, a >. By com-\nparing the model prediction with the ground truth\nanswer, we can obtain a fine-grained diagnosis of\nthe decision making process as follows:\nPerception Score (P-Score) measures the model’s\naccuracy in perceiving the observation. It is com-\nputed based on whether the agent’s reasoning pro-\ncess r includes the key concept of the instance. A\nscore of 1 is assigned if at least one question-related\nkey concept is described by the agent; otherwise,\nit is 0. For the top example in Figure 2, the agent\nshould output “clear road” or “no car visible” or\nother semantically equivalent concepts in its de-\nscription of the image to get the perception score.\nParsing the model’s output and determining\nwhether it entails the key concept using shallow\nfeatures of the sentence is not trivial. We leverage\nLLM to conduct entailment detection, which turns\nout to have a high alignment with human judgment.\nCognition Score (C-Score) assesses the model’s\nability to reason, comprehend, and make informed\ndecisions based on the perceived input data and\nworld knowledge. The score is 1 if the reasoning\nprocess is correct, otherwise the score is 0. For\nthe instance in Figure 2, the agent should link the\n“clear road” to the action “keep driving” based on\ntransportation commonsense to get the score.\nAction Score (A-Score) measures the model’s abil-\nity to generate appropriate and effective responses\nor actions based on the perceived input data and\nthe cognitive understanding of the context. The\nscore is assigned a value of 1 if the agent selects\nthe correct action; otherwise, the score is set to 0.\n2.3\nAutomatic Evaluation\nRecent advancements have seen researchers har-\nnessing powerful LLMs for the evaluation of the\noutput of language models. Studies have revealed\nthat the outcomes from LLMs could exhibit re-\nmarkable alignment with human judgments (Zheng\net al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b,a). In our investiga-\ntion, we employed GPT-4 to automatically evaluate\nperception, cognition, and action scores based on\nthe model’s outputs. Our findings underscore a\nsignificant agreement between GPT-4 scoring and\nhuman evaluation results. This is substantiated by\nCohen-Kappa coefficients of 0.71, 0.82, and 0.94\nfor perception, cognition, and action evaluations,\nrespectively. Experiments of human evaluation and\ncomparison of open LLMs are in section 4.1. For a\ndetailed description of our evaluation tool, kindly\nrefer to Appendix D.\n2.4\nBenchmark Dataset Overview\nFor the test set, the examples are written by 3 hu-\nman experts for each domain. There are no over-\nlapped environmental observations between the\ntraining and test sets. The details of the human\nannotation pipeline can be found in Appendix B.\nWe introduce the three domains encompassed by\nour dataset as follows:\nAutonomous Driving.\nIn the autonomous driv-\ning domain, instances are derived from real-world\ntransportation scenes, which requires the agent to\nhave particular abilities such as traffic sign recogni-\ntion, obstacle detection, and decision-making at in-\ntersections. The dataset aims to evaluate an agent’s\nability to perceive and interpret visual informa-\ntion while making safe and efficient driving deci-\nsions. The images are collected from TT100K (Zhu\net al., 2016) dataset and annotators are instructed\nto propose an image-conditioned question that is\ngrounded with real actions of vehicles.\nDomestic Robot.\nThe domestic assistance do-\nmain features instances from the ALFRED (Shrid-\nhar et al., 2020; Kolve et al., 2017) environment,\nwhich simulates a housekeeper robot performing\ntasks within a household setting. These tasks may\ninclude object manipulation, navigation, and inter-\naction with various appliances. The environment\nassesses an agent’s ability to understand and exe-\ncute complex instructions while navigating and in-\nteracting with a dynamic environment. Annotators\nare asked to select one image from the randomly\ngenerated scenes in the environment, propose a\nquestion related to the items on the scene, and an-\nnotate the full information of the instance.\nTopology Graph: Harvest beef using iron sword\nCraft 2 Iron Ingot\nCollect 2 Wood\nCraft 1 Stick\nFind a Cow\nKill a Cow\nCraft an Iron Sword\nCollect 2 Iron Ore\nFigure 3: Illustration of task topology graph. Events in\ngreen represent the leaf nodes of the graph.\nOpen-World Game.\nIn the open-world game do-\nmain, instances are sourced from the Minecraft en-\nvironment, where agents are tasked with exploring,\ncrafting, and surviving in a procedurally generated\nworld. This dataset evaluates an agent’s ability to\nreason and plan actions within a complex, open-\nended environment, which often requires long-term\nstrategizing and adaptability. Annotators receive\npredefined tasks from MineDojo (Fan et al., 2022)\nas a reference during the task generation phase. For\neach task, we instruct the annotator to sketch a task\ntopology graph, exemplified in Figure 3. The task\nshould be completed under the topological order of\nthe graph, where the event located in the leaf nodes\nshould be finished first. Each node in the task topol-\nogy graph can be viewed as a step in the sequential\ndecision. We list the in-domain task distribution in\nAppendix A.\n2.5\nEmbodied Instruction Evolution\nThe PCA-Bench benchmark also includes subset\nof automatic generated samples by Embodied In-\nstruction Evolution(EIE), which is used as training\nset in our experiment.\nThe annotation of PCA-Bench examples is a\nlabor-intensive task. As illustrated in Figure 4, we\nintroduce Embodied Instruction Evolution (EIE),\na method for automatically augmenting examples\nin the PCA-Bench format using Large Language\nModels, such as ChatGPT. This process involves\nfour key steps:\n1) Setup of Programmable Interface: Estab-\nlish a programmable interface with a corresponding\ntemplate, ensuring that observations in the embod-\nied environment can be generated based on specific\nparameters.\n2) Generation of Seed Tasks: Create initial\nseed tasks for each environment. These tasks are\nrepresentative of the general challenges an agent\nFigure 4: Pipeline of the Embodied Instruction Evolution method.\nmight encounter. We provide ChatGPT with sam-\nple tasks and enable it to generate additional seed\ntasks.\n3) Task Specification and Template Filling:\nFor each seed task, we instruct ChatGPT to break\ndown the task into multiple subtasks, following its\nevent topology graph (as seen in Figure 3). This\napproach mimics the multi-step decision-making\nprocess. After determining the subtask names, we\nuse the LLM to populate the environment parame-\nter templates created in Step 1 for each subtask.\n4) Observation Generation and Filtering:\nGenerate observations for the environment and im-\nplement an automatic process to filter out invalid\ninstances. The filled templates may contain er-\nrors, such as incorrect creature names or impos-\nsible items, leading to errors during environment\ncreation. When such errors occur, the affected tem-\nplates are automatically filtered out. For domains\nwithout programmable environments (autonomous\ndriving), step 1 and step 4 are not needed, we col-\nlect real traffic images and utilize GPT4-Vision to\ngenerate seed task based on the image content.\nEIE leverages the capabilities of Large Language\nModels to reduce manual labor and improve the\ndiversity and scalability of PCA-Bench.\n3\nExperiments\n3.1\nTracks\nZero Shot End-to-End.\nThe test set of PCA-\nBench serves as an effective tool for comparing\nthe embodied decision-making and cross-modal\nreasoning capabilities of various Multimodal Lan-\nguage Learning Models (MLLMs). In this evalu-\nation, the same images and prompts are provided\nto each model under test. Additionally, to address\nthe challenge of perceiving certain non-visual in-\nformation from images, details such as “items in\nhand” and “items in inventory”, particularly rele-\nvant in domestic and gaming domains, are directly\nincluded in the question prompts.\nIn our analysis, we benchmark the performance\nof the most recently open-sourced models, includ-\ning LLaVA1.5 and Qwen-VL-Chat, as well as the\nAPI-only GPT4-V model. All models are evalu-\nated using their default inference configurations to\nensure a fair and standardized comparison.\nFinetuning with EIE.\nIn this track, we extend\nthe capabilities of open-source MLLMs by fine-\ntuning them with the training set generated through\nour Embodied Instruction Evolution (EIE) method.\nAfter the fine-tuning process, these trained models\nare subjected to the test set of PCA-Bench. We\nfinetune the LLaVA-7b\/13b, MMICL and Qwen-\nVL-Chat models on the training set for 5 epochs.\nThe training details are in Appendix E.\nZero Shot Modality Conversion.\nIn this track,\nwe introduce and compare a new baseline, termed\nHOLMES, which utilizes LLM without multi-\nmodal perception capabilities. Instead, HOLMES\nrelies on modality conversion APIs for embodied\ndecision-making processes. Within the HOLMES\nframework, the LLM must continuously invoke\nvarious APIs, retrieving and processing return in-\nformation about the environment.

EIE improves the performance on all domains for both\nLLaVA1.5-7b and Qwen-VL-Chat models. Results of LLavA1.5-13B and MMICL are in Figure 13 from appendix.\nWe evaluate two LLMs in this track: ChatGPT-\n3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-0613, comparing their per-\nformances against the advanced GPT-4-Vision. Im-\nplementation details of the HOLMES framework\nand the APIs are provided in Appendix C.\n3.2\nEvaluation and Metrics\nWe use our PCA-Eval evaluation tool proposed in\nSection 2.3 to automatically assess the output of dif-\nferent models through three lenses: perception (P-\nScore), cognition (C-Score), and action (A-Score).\n3.3\nMain Results\nZero Shot Results.\nThe results of the zero-shot\nend-to-end track are shown in Table 1. Among\nall MLLMs, GPT4-V, outperforms existing open-\nsource models by achieving the highest scores of\n0.86, 0.7, and 0.68 in the perception, cognition, and\naction dimensions respectively. This performance\nrepresents a 15% action score improvement over\nits strongest open-source counterpart, LLaVA1.5-\n13B. The impressive performance of GPT4-V is\nprimarily attributed to its exceptional ability to per-\nceive visual information across different domains\nand the world knowledge in the language model,\nparticularly in the challenging game domain.\nImpact of Finetuning with EIE.\nThe results of\nthe fine-tuning track are illustrated in Figure 5. Our\nEIE method has been found to significantly en-\nhance the general decision-making abilities of vari-\nous models, encompassing perception, cognition,\nand action. Notably, it has led to an average in-\ncrease of 0.24 and 0.19 in action scores for the\nLLaVA1.5-7b and Qwen-VL-Chat models, respec-\ntively. Results for LLaVA1.5-13b and MMICL are\nillustrated in Figure 13, also showing improved\nperformance when trained with EIE. We note that\nthere exist reasoning or perception errors in some\nof the generated sample due to the hallucination\nproblem of LLM generated content, however they\ndo not influence the overall performance. In some\ncases, these sub-scores have matched or even sur-\npassed those of the GPT4-V model, demonstrating\nthe potential of the EIE to scale up and apply to\ndifferent environments.\nComparison Between End-to-End and Modality\nConversion Method\nIn the zero-shot modality\nconversion track, we conduct an analysis and com-\nparison of the outputs generated by the End2End\nMethod\nModel\nTraffic\nDomestic\nGame\nAverage\nP\nC\nA\nP\nC\nA\nP\nC\nA\nP\nC\nA\nEnd-to-End\nGPT-4V\n0.75\n0.73\n0.78\n0.81\n0.69\n0.67\n0.95\n0.79\n0.77\n0.84\n0.74\n0.74\nHOLMES\nChatGPT\n0.75\n0.68\n0.66\n0.88\n0.52\n0.50\n0.78\n0.40\n0.36\n0.80\n0.53\n0.51\nGPT4\n0.87\n0.82\n0.82\n0.85\n0.61\n0.56\n0.91\n0.77\n0.74\n0.88\n0.73\n0.71\nTable 2: Comparison between End-to-End (MLLM) and HOLMES (LLM+API) methods on a subset of PCA-Bench\nwith API annotation.\nmethod with GPT4-V, as well as the HOLMES\nmethod with GPT4 and ChatGPT-3.5 in Table 2.\nThe results show that the HOLMES system\nbased on GPT4 achieves 0.71 Action Score, which\nis on par with GPT4-V’s performance (0.74). This\nindicates that, overall, the HOLMES system is able\nto accurately understand the task goal, split the\nlarger goal into multiple smaller steps, and cor-\nrectly invoke the relevant APIs to accomplish each\nstep. Specifically, the HOLMES system based on\nGPT4 can recognize the key concepts in a task, and\nperceive the state and environment of these con-\ncepts through the results returned by APIs. Conse-\nquently, the system achieves an average Perception\nScore of 0.88, which even outperforms GPT4-V’s\n0.84. However, compared to End2End methods,\nHOLMES relies on multi-step reasoning for the\nfinal decision, in which reasoning errors tend to\naccumulate, and thus achieves a lower Cognition\nScore in both Domestic and Game domains.\nOn the other hand, we also find that the End2End\nmethod effectively mitigates information loss dur-\ning the modality conversion process. As illustrated\nin Figure 8 from Appendix, an image depicts a\nroad with several nearby cars. GPT4-V is capable\nof discerning that the street is not crowded, thereby\nsuggesting that the driver can continue driving.\nConversely, GPT4-HOLMES, while being aware\nof the number of cars, lacks information about their\nspatial relation, leading it to recommend slowing\ndown because of the existence of 14 cars. This\nsuggests that the End2End method is superior in\nperceiving certain visual features that are not cap-\ntured by the APIs. Conversely, some specialized\nAPIs, such as traffic sign detection, outperform\nGPT4-V in tasks like traffic sign detection, as they\nare specifically trained for this task. This could en-\nable the HOLMES method to gather more accurate\ninformation than the End2End model.\nEvaluator Model\nKappa Coefficients\nP\nC\nA\nGPT4†\n0.71\n0.82\n0.94\nQwen1.5-72B-Chat†\n0.30\n0.49\n0.60\nQwen1.5-14B-Chat†\n0.16\n0.24\n0.16\nQwen1.5-7B-Chat†\n0.20\n0.11\n0.06\nTable 3: Comparison of Open† and Close† LLMs as\nEvaluators. Kappa coefficients of Qwens increase when\nthe model scales up.\n4\nDiscussion\n4.1\nStrong LLMs are Good Error Locators.\nAs shown in Table 3, we compare the scoring kappa\ncoefficients with human assessments for different\nLLMs. We randomly select 300 model outputs\nequally from different domains and ask 3 human\nexperts to give perception, cognition, and action\nscores. The final result is based on the majority\nof three annotators. The result underscores a sig-\nnificant agreement between GPT-4 scoring and hu-\nman evaluation results. This is substantiated by\nCohen-Kappa coefficients of 0.71, 0.82, and 0.94\nfor perception, cognition, and action evaluations.\nWe also compare open models as evaluators.\nWe choose one of the best open LLMs, Qwen1.51\nseries from 7B, 14B to 72B version. Currently\nopen LLMs tend to give wrongly high judgments in\nall sub-scores. Although currently trailing behind\nGPT-4 in performance, we anticipate that with tar-\ngeted training focused on error identification and\nenhancements in the overall capabilities of open\nLLMs, these models will become more effective\nevaluation tools compared to closed models. This\nis primarily due to the reproducible and transpar-\nent nature of open models, which offer significant\nadvantages in the development of evaluation tools.\n1https:\/\/huggingface.co\/collections\/Qwen\n4.2\nGenuine PCA Score\nPCA-Eval could pinpoint cases where the MLLM\ngets the correct answer by a fluke where perception\nor cognition score is 0 but the action score is 1. It\nexplains why for some models, the action score is\nhigher than perception and cognition scores. For in-\nstance, a model might opt for a conservative action,\nsuch as slowing down, even without accurately rec-\nognizing snowy weather in the image, resulting in\na fluky correct action. In another scenario, if the\nmodel exhibits a preference for a specific choice\nindex, it will attain a high action score provided\nthat the evaluation dataset contains a substantial\nnumber of correct choices matching the preferred\nindex, a phenomenon attributable to the positional\nbiases inherent in both the model and the dataset.\nTo overcome the mentioned bias when evaluating\nthe genuine ability of MLLM, we propose a new\nmetric Genuine PCA Score. It is equal to one\nif the perception, cogntion and action scores are\nall 1 for one model’s response to a question. We\nfind that for all models, there exists significant gap\n(>10%) between the action score and genuine PCA\nscore in average, revealing that relying on single\nmetric such as choice accuracy is very problematic\nwhen conducting model evaluation. In our online\nleaderboard, both average action score and average\ngenuine PCA score are considered when ranking\nthe candidate models.\n4.3\nAlignment between Agent Decisions and\nHuman Values\nWe have observed instances where the decisions\nmade by the agent contradict human values. Con-\nsider the scenario depicted in Figure 9 from Ap-\npendix. The image illustrates a crosswalk with-\nout pedestrians. The appropriate response would\nbe slowing down, as caution is paramount when\napproaching a crosswalk, regardless of the pres-\nence or absence of pedestrians. However, upon\nprocessing the information that the crosswalk is\nempty, ChatGPT suggests that maintaining the cur-\nrent speed is the optimal action, arguing that the\nabsence of pedestrians eliminates the need to slow\ndown. The rationale provided by ChatGPT is logi-\ncal, yet it does not align with human values.\n5\nRelated Work\nMLLM Benchmark.\nIn recent times, there\nhave been several benchmarks built for evaluating\nMLLMs, such as MMBench, MME, Seed-Bench,\nPOPE (Liu et al., 2023e; Fu et al., 2023; Li et al.,\n2023a,e) that assess MLLMs performance from\nmultiple fine-grained dimensions.\nVisit-Bench,\nLVLM-eHub, M3IT (Bitton et al., 2023; Xu et al.,\n2023; Li et al., 2023c) focus on the general in-\nstruction following ability. General VQA tasks\nlike OKVQA, VQAv2, Vizwiz, ScienceQA, VSR\nand IconQA (Marino et al., 2019; Agrawal et al.,\n2015; Gurari et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2022; Liu et al.,\n2023a; Lu et al., 2021) focus on visual understand-\ning. MMMU, MathVista, LLaVA-benchmark and\nMM-Vet (Yue et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2023a; Liu\net al., 2023c; Yu et al., 2023) require abilities from\nthe vision part and specific knowledge in the lan-\nguage part. A lack of error localization techniques\nbeyond accuracy assessments is among current\nbenchmarks. This complicates identifying which\npart of the MLLM malfunctioned when making\nmistakes. Unlike prior work, PCA-Bench is more\nrelevant to evaluate MLLMs’ ability to utilize inte-\ngrated abilities to solve one task and make explain-\nable decisions via error localization.\nLLM Agent and Embodied Decision Making.\nUsing LLMs to empower the AI agents (Xi et al.,\n2023; Liu et al., 2023d; Park et al., 2023; Wang\net al., 2023d) becomes more and more promis-\ning. Specifically, we can employ LLMs to enhance\nthe decision making ability of the agents (Nakano\net al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023d;\nSong et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b), expanding\ntheir perception and action space through strate-\ngies like tool utilization (Schick et al., 2023; Qin\net al., 2023; Lu et al., 2023b). This line of research\ndivides the entire decision-making process into two\nphases: (1) information seeking, usually involving\nMLLMs to verbalize the current status of AI agents\nin the vision-based environment with natural lan-\nguage; (2) reasoning and planning with text-based\nLLMs to decide what the AI agent should do in\nthe next step with textual clues. Although LLM-\nbased agents demonstrate reasoning and planning\nabilities through techniques like Chain of Thought\nor problem decomposition (Wei et al., 2023; Yao\net al., 2023; Kojima et al., 2022), they inherently\nlack visual perception, and are limited to the dis-\ncrete textual content. Therefore, integrating mul-\ntimodal information can offer agents a broader\ncontext and a more precise understanding, such\nas PaLM-E (Driess et al., 2023), enhancing their\nenvironmental perception. However, there is still\nlarge gap deploying MLLM in various embodied\nenvironments due to the lack of appropriate bench-\nmark and interface linking those two domains while\nPCA-Bench is an attempt towards that goal.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we introduce PCA-Bench, a mul-\ntimodal benchmark designed to assess the inte-\ngrated decision-making capabilities of MLLMs.\nThis benchmark features PCA-EVAL, a novel fine-\ngrained automatic evaluation tool that diagnoses\ndecision making processes from three critical per-\nspectives: perception, cognition, and action. To\nenhance the decision making ability from data per-\nspective, we propose the Embodied Instruction Evo-\nlution method to automatically synthesize instruc-\ntion examples from different environments, which\nhas been proven effective in our main experiments.\nWe believe that powerful MLLMs pave a new and\npromising way toward decision making in embod-\nied environments and we hope PCA-Bench could\nserve as a good benchmark in evaluation and error\nlocalization for MLLMs’ development.\n7\nLimitations\nThe current scope of PCA-Bench is confined to\nmerely three domains in static environments. One\nof our future works aims to broaden this scope\nto encompass more domains and dynamic embod-\nied environments where MLLMs could keep get-\nting feedback, which is closer to real embodied\nAI scenarios.\nWe do not apply different infer-\nence enhancement methods like In-Context Learn-\ning and Reflection in the decision making process\nof MLLMs. We just use the simplest prompting\nmethod and leave the exploration of a better cross-\nmodal Chain-of-Thought method for future studies.\nCurrently, PCA-Eval shows the best consistency\nwith human evaluators when using powerful close\nLLM GPT4, which would bring additional cost to\nthe user of PCA-Eval. We plan to develop and re-\nlease an open error locator for error localization in\nthe benchmark in the future.\n```\n\n#### 5. 学生问题\n问题1：介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」\n问题2：这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？\n问题3：这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？\n\n\n请输出论文总结\n### 输出格式（输出语言用中文）\n```\n## 💡 解答问题1 (...复述学生问题1...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (...复述学生问题2...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (...复述学生问题3...)\n...\n```\n","llm_summary_res":"## 🌟 论文解读 | PCA-Bench：评估多模态大语言模型在感知-认知-行动链中的决策能力\n\n## 📌 背景痛点\/本文动机\n随着多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在处理复杂任务方面的能力日益增强，现有的评估基准往往只关注单个模型能力的评估，而忽略了模型在感知、认知和行动方面的综合能力。此外，现有的基准缺乏对模型错误进行定位的能力，这使得难以确定模型在哪些方面需要改进。\n\n## 🚀 核心方法\n💡 创新点1：PCA-Bench\n本文提出了PCA-Bench，这是一个用于评估MLLMs在感知-认知-行动链中决策能力的多模态决策基准。PCA-Bench引入了三个复杂的场景：自动驾驶、家庭机器人和开放世界游戏。在这些场景中，模型需要根据任务指令和不同的上下文，无缝地整合感知、认知和行动的能力，以做出准确的决策。\n\n💡 创新点2：PCA-Eval\n为了平衡评估的准确性和效率，本文提出了PCA-Eval，这是一个自动评估协议。PCA-Eval利用LLMs强大的语义解析能力，根据数据注释中的锚点信息，自动进行错误定位。实验结果表明，PCA-Eval与人类评估结果具有高度的一致性，平均Kappa系数达到0.8+。\n\n💡 创新点3：Embodied-Instruction-Evolution (EIE)\n为了解决PCA-Bench数据集标注工作量大的问题，本文提出了Embodied-Instruction-Evolution (EIE)框架。EIE利用LLMs自动合成多模态具身环境中的指令调整示例，从而减少了人工劳动，并提高了PCA-Bench的多样性和可扩展性。\n\n## 📈 实验结果\n实验结果表明，GPT-4 Vision在感知、认知和行动方面都表现出色，超过了现有的开源MLLMs。EIE方法能够显著提高开源MLLMs的性能，在某些指标上甚至超过了GPT-4 Vision。PCA-Eval能够有效地定位模型错误，从而提高了模型评估的可靠性。\n\n## 💬 可借鉴之处\n本文提出的PCA-Bench和PCA-Eval为评估MLLMs的决策能力提供了一个新的基准和评估工具。EIE框架为自动合成多模态具身环境中的指令调整示例提供了一种有效的方法。本文的研究结果表明，强大的MLLMs在具身智能体中的决策能力具有很大的潜力，为MLLMs的研究开辟了新的方向。","llm_summary_res_status":200,"order":0,"query_answer":"## 💡 解答问题1 (介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」)\n\n这篇论文提出的benchmark是PCA-Bench，这是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在感知-认知-行动链中决策能力的多模态决策基准。PCA-Bench引入了三个复杂的场景：自动驾驶、家庭机器人和开放世界游戏。在这些场景中，模型需要根据任务指令和不同的上下文，无缝地整合感知、认知和行动的能力，以做出准确的决策。此外，PCA-Bench还具备错误定位能力，可以分析模型在感知、知识或推理等方面的不准确之处，从而提高模型部署的可靠性。\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？)\n\n论文中并没有明确说明PCA-Bench需要什么设备条件。然而，由于PCA-Bench是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型的基准，因此它可能需要高性能的计算设备，例如具有多个GPU和大量内存的服务器。此外，由于PCA-Bench涉及图像处理和自然语言处理等任务，因此它可能还需要具有强大计算能力的机器学习框架和库。\n\n至于本文的模型训练和推理所使用的设备，论文中也没有明确说明。然而，由于论文中提到的模型包括GPT-4 Vision等大型模型，因此它们可能需要高性能的计算设备，例如具有多个GPU和大量内存的服务器。\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？)\n\nPCA-Bench是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在感知-认知-行动链中决策能力的多模态决策基准。它引入了三个复杂的场景：自动驾驶、家庭机器人和开放世界游戏。在这些场景中，模型需要根据任务指令和不同的上下文，无缝地整合感知、认知和行动的能力，以做出准确的决策。此外，PCA-Bench还具备错误定位能力，可以分析模型在感知、知识或推理等方面的不准确之处，从而提高模型部署的可靠性。\n\nPCA-Bench的评估协议PCA-Eval是一个基于锚点的评估协议，它利用LLMs强大的语义解析能力，根据数据注释中的锚点信息，自动进行错误定位。实验结果表明，PCA-Eval与人类评估结果具有高度的一致性，平均Kappa系数达到0.8+。PCA-Eval能够有效地定位模型错误，从而提高了模型评估的可靠性。\n\nPCA-Bench还引入了Embodied-Instruction-Evolution (EIE)框架，它利用LLMs自动合成多模态具身环境中的指令调整示例，从而减少了人工劳动，并提高了PCA-Bench的多样性和可扩展性。EIE框架为自动合成多模态具身环境中的指令调整示例提供了一种有效的方法。\n\nPCA-Bench的实验结果表明，GPT-4 Vision在感知、认知和行动方面都表现出色，超过了现有的开源MLLMs。EIE方法能够显著提高开源MLLMs的性能，在某些指标上甚至超过了GPT-4 Vision。PCA-Eval能够有效地定位模型错误，从而提高了模型评估的可靠性。\n\n综上所述，PCA-Bench是一个具有高质量评估协议和错误定位能力的基准，它能够有效地评估多模态大语言模型的决策能力。PCA-Bench的引入为评估MLLMs的决策能力提供了一个新的基准和评估工具，并为MLLMs的研究开辟了新的方向。","query_answer_status":200}

Firstly, it incorporates six complex strate-\ngic games which serve as ideal testbeds due to their\nlong-term and multi-dimensional decision-making\ndemands and flexibility in customizing tasks of var-\nious difficulty levels or multiple targets. Secondly,\nDSGBench employs a fine-grained evaluation scor-\ning system which examines the decision-making\ncapabilities by looking into the performance in\nfive specific dimensions and offering a compre-\nhensive assessment in a well-designed way. Fur-\nthermore, DSGBench also incorporates an auto-\nmated decision-tracking mechanism which enables\nin-depth analysis of agent behaviour patterns and\nthe changes in their strategies.\nWe demonstrate\nthe advances of DSGBench by applying it to multi-\nple popular LLM-based agents and our results sug-\ngest that DSGBench provides valuable insights in\nchoosing LLM-based agents as well as improving\ntheir future development. DSGBench is available at\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/DeciBrain-Group\/DSGBench1.\n1\nIntroduction\nRecent progress on large language models (LLMs) has\nshown substantial improvements in reasoning, planning, and\nproblem-solving, especially in well-defined closed-world en-\nvironments such as web navigation, household management,\nand assistant programming [Xi et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023;\nQian et al., 2024]. These advancements highlight the poten-\ntial of LLMs to be employed in more complicated settings\nlike open-world situations and strategic gaming[Wang et al.,\n2023; Ma et al., 2023b]. Nevertheless, applying LLMs in\nsuch environments demands not only a deep understanding of\nthe motivations and potential deceptive tactics of enemies, but\nalso advanced reasoning to anticipate risks and vulnerabilities\n1Please contact twj@nudt.edu.cn if any problem occurs.\nin our strategies. We believe that unlocking this potential re-\nquires further developments in model architectures as well as\nestablishing a rigorous evaluation framework to assess their\ncapabilities[Chang et al., 2024] systematically.\nDespite significant advances in LLM benchmarking, ex-\nisting assessment frameworks suffer from three key limita-\ntions when applied to complicated decision-making settings.\nFirstly, these benchmarks are usually built on environments\nfor static or single-objective tasks [Xie et al., 2024; Zhong\net al., 2023], failing to incorporate real-world dynamic sit-\nuations or constantly changing goals.\nSecondly, common\nevaluation metrics focus extensively on result-oriented per-\nformance like task completion rate and win rate [Liu et al.,\n2023; Xi et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023]. How-\never, most models have near-zero success rates in challenging\nenvironments[Xie et al., 2024], and therefore, overly broad\nassessing scores are difficult to evaluate strengths and weak-\nnesses among LLM-based agents properly.\nFurthermore,\nsome existing works concentrate on single-dimensional capa-\nbilities[Bailis et al., 2024a; Mukobi et al., 2023], which lacks\nsystematic evaluation of core cognitive capabilities which\nare crucial for strategic gaming tasks. Such evaluation re-\nquires to analyze an LLM-based agent from aspects including\nlong-term strategic planning, short-term real-time decision-\nmaking, and social reasoning of external adversaries.\nTo address these challenges, we introduce DSGBench, a\ndiverse strategic game benchmark designed to assess LLM-\nbased agents across multiple dimensions of cognitive and in-\nteractive capabilities. DSGBench is built around three key\ncomponents: a set of diverse and complex strategy games,\na comprehensive evaluation scoring system, and a detailed\ndecision-tracking mechanism. The overall framework of DS-\nGBench is shown in Figure 1. The platform includes six clas-\nsic strategic games which are StarCraft II [Ma et al., 2023a],\nCivilization [Qi et al., 2024], Street Fighter III [Wikipedia,\n2024e], Diplomacy [Mukobi et al., 2023], Werewolf [Bailis\net al., 2024a], and Stratego [Wikipedia, 2024d]. They each\nselected to test specific skill sets, including strategic plan-\nning, real-time decision-making, social reasoning, team col-\nlaboration, and adaptive learning. These games replicate the\ndynamics of the real world through multi-agent interactions,\nlong-context decision-making, and the achievement of vari-\nous sub-goals, providing a varied scene setting that allows for\na comprehensive assessment of agents’ adaptability and cog-\nnitive integration.\nA key feature of DSGBench is its novel evaluation frame-\nwork that incorporates fine-grained metrics to provide a com-\nprehensive view of agent performance across multiple dimen-\nsions. These designed metrics capture the nuances of agent\nbehaviour, particularly in decision-making under uncertainty,\narXiv:2503.06047v1  [cs.AI]  8 Mar 2025\nFigure 1: The overall framework of DSGBench. The framework consists of (1) a multi-game environment supporting both asynchronous\nand synchronous interactions; (2) fine-grained capability metrics for strategic planning, real-time decision-making, and team collaboration;\nand (3) decision trajectory tracking tools that collaboratively analyze agents’ decision-making processes. Through observation-to-prompt and\nresponse-to-action loops, DSGBench enables systematic evaluation of LLM-based agents in dynamic, multi-agent scenarios.\nlong-term strategic planning, and adaptive strategy adjust-\nment. Through this multi-dimensional analysis, DSGBench\nprovides deeper insights into agent capabilities beyond con-\nventional success measures. Additionally, our benchmark in-\ntegrates detailed decision-tracking functionality, offering re-\nsearchers clear visibility into agents’ underlying decision-\nmaking processes. This transparency is essential for improv-\ning model interpretability and advancing agent design.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nLLM-based agents\nLLM-based agents present human-like cognitive abilities to\nsolve decision-making problems.\nIn early applications of\nthe LLMs, they achieved significant success in handling rel-\natively simple tasks such as role-playing and code genera-\ntion[Nijkamp et al., 2022; Park et al., 2023] due to their\nstrong capabilities in instruction following, language com-\nprehension, and generation[Wang et al., 2024b]. As the re-\nsearch progressed, researchers began to focus on how to in-\nteract LLMs with external tools or environments[Schick et\nal., 2023; Tang et al., 2024], where the key technique is\nto provide relevant instruction and environment information\nthrough context, which enables LLM-based agents to gener-\nate executable actions in response to complex tasks. In ad-\ndition, researchers have systematically explored the capabili-\nties of LLM-based agents in perception, memory, decision-\nmaking, and tool use, with application areas ranging from\nweb navigation, software development, and game decision-\nmaking[Wang et al., 2024b; Zhou et al., 2023; Qian et al.,\n2024; Ma et al., 2023b]. Among these advances, the emer-\ngent reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents are particu-\nlarly critical and are an integral part of the decision-making\nprocess[Hao et al., 2024]. Furthermore, it is found that LLMs\nhave demonstrated advanced cognitive capabilities such as\nhuman-like chain-of-thought reasoning, world modeling, and\ntheory of mind[Wei et al., 2022; Hao et al., 2023; Shapira\net al., 2023].\nThese capabilities influence aspects of how\nLLM-based agents respond to changes in adversary strategies,\nhow they make rational decisions in uncertain environments,\nand how they maintain long-term and short-term consistency\nacross successive decision-making processes.\n2.2\nExisting Benchmarks for LLM-based agents\nWith the enhancement of the comprehensive capabilities of\nLLMs, there is a growing trend to evaluate their performance\nin more challenging open-world or complex gaming scenar-\nios. Although static datasets provided effective evaluation in\nearly studies, they failed to reflect the true performance of\nLLMs in dynamic and complex environments [Huang et al.,\n2024; Bai et al., 2023]. To address this limitation, subse-\nquent research has begun to evaluate LLM-based agents in\nexecutable environments, focusing on revealing their capa-\nbilities in an open-ended generation, multi-round interaction,\nand agent-based role-playing[Wang et al., 2024b]. Current\nresearchers have focused on areas such as software develop-\nment, embodied agents, society simulations, gaming, and pol-\nicy making[Hong et al., 2023; Mandi et al., 2024; Kaiya et\nal., 2023; Mukobi et al., 2023], which have provided LLM\nassessments with more authentic and diverse contexts.\nIn particular, strategy games have been widely recog-\nnized as ideal experimental platforms for evaluating decision-\nmaking capabilities of LLM-based agents due to their com-\nplex reasoning requirements and dynamic interaction prop-\nerties [Liu et al., 2023]. They require agents to engage in\nmultistep reasoning, predict the actions of other agents, and\nBenchmark\nComplex\nGame Theory\nFine-Grained\nCapability Metrics\nDecision\nTrajectory Analysis\nReal-Time &\nTurn-Based\nDiverse\n-Scenarios\nAgentBench[Liu et al., 2023]\n✘\n✘\n✘\n✔\n✔\nSmartPlay[Wu et al., 2023]\n✘\n✘\n✘\n✘\n✘\nGameBench[Costarelli et al., 2024]\n✔\n✘\n✘\n✘\n✘\nGTBench[Duan et al., 2024]\n✔\n✘\n✘\n✘\n✘\nMAgIC[Xu et al., 2023]\n✔\n✘\n✘\n✘\n✘\nAgentBoard[Ma et al., 2024]\n✘\n✘\n✔\n✘\n✔\nAgentGym[Xi et al., 2024]\n✘\n✘\n✘\n✔\n✔\nDSGBench(Ours)\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\nTable 1: Compare various LLM-based agent benchmarks across key dimensions. While most benchmarks, such as GTBench and SmartPlay,\nfocus on specific tasks or dimensions, DSGBench stands out by offering broader support across complex game theory, fine-grained metrics,\ndecision trajectory analysis, and diverse scenarios. This makes it a more suitable option for evaluating LLM-based agents in complex envi-\nronments.\nbalance competing goals under uncertainty, thus simulating\nreal-world challenges. However, as shown in table 1, bench-\nmarks such as GTBench[Duan et al., 2024], SmartPlay[Wu\net al., 2023], and MAgIC[Xu et al., 2023] focus on uni-\ndimensional capabilities, neglecting the integrated cognitive\nskills required to cope with interdependence and uncertainty\nin dynamic environments. In addition, benchmarks such as\nAgentBench[Liu et al., 2023] and GameBench[Costarelli et\nal., 2024] use eventual success as the core metric, which lim-\nits their insight into complex decision-making processes.\n3\nDSGBench - Preliminary\n3.1\nGame Interaction Formulation\nIn DSGBench evaluation, we model agent-environment in-\nteractions as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Pro-\ncess (POMDP), formalized as the quintuple ⟨W, S, A, O, T⟩.\nHere, W denotes the victory condition—the strategic objec-\ntives agents must achieve, such as destroying the opponent’s\nbase in StarCraft II or achieving victory through multiple\npathways (combat conquest, cultural dominance, or scientific\nadvancement) in Civilization. S represents the state space,\nencompassing all observable environmental states within the\ncurrent game. A defines the action space of all legal actions\navailable to an agent per time step, including movement, com-\nbat, dialogue, and negotiation. O comprises the observation\nspace, containing environmental feedback ft that reflects im-\nmediate state changes and responses to agent actions. T rep-\nresents the state transition function S×A →S, mapping how\nthe current state st and agent action at determine the subse-\nquent state st+1.\nSingle-level Inference. Games such as Street Fighter III,\nDiplomacy, Werewolf, and Stratego Games are particularly\nsuited for single-level reasoning due to their centralized state\nand action spaces.\nThe reasoning process is formalized as\npπ(τ) = p(s0)\nT −1\nY\nt=0\np(at|st, ft) · T(st+1|st, at, ft)\n(1)\nwhere pπ(τ) represents the policy trajectory, p(s0) is the\ninitial state distribution, p(at|st, ft) denotes the probabil-\nity of taking action at given state st and feedback ft, and\nT(st+1|st, at, ft) is the state transition function. In single-\nlevel reasoning games, agents can effectively accomplish\ncomplex tasks with simplified state and action reasoning.\nTwo-level Inference. Complex strategy games like Star-\nCraft II and Civilization require agents to handle large obser-\nvation spaces and multi-dimensional tasks through two levels\nof reasoning: high-level strategic planning (for example, re-\nsource management and army deployment) and low-level tac-\ntical decisions (for example, executing micro-operations and\nmanaging local combat).\npπ(τ) = p(s0)\nT −1\nY\nt=0\np(ahigh\nt\n| st, chigh)·\np(alow\nt\n| st, ahigh\nt\n, clow) · T(st+1 | st, alow\nt , ft)\n(2)\nHere, ahigh\nt\nrepresents high-level strategic decisions based\non global policy chigh; alow\nt\ndenotes immediate tactical ac-\ntions guided by local feedback clow, and T(st+1|st, alow\nt\n, ft)\ndefines the state transition function reflecting environmental\nchanges in response to current actions.\n3.2\nCapability Score Computation\nTo compute the scores of the LLMs across different capabil-\nity dimensions, we first establish the mapping between each\ncapability dimension and multiple associated games, where\neach game is linked to a set of fine-grained metrics. The score\nfor each capability dimension is calculated by weighting the\nperformance metrics of the associated games on multiple fine-\ngrained metrics. Its definition is as follows:\nT =\nm\nX\ni=1\nWi · βi ·\n\n\nn\nX\nj=1\nwj ·\n1\nkj\nPkj\nk=1 Ryjk −minj Ryj\nmaxj Ryj −minj Ryj\n\n\n(3)\nwhere the aggregated capability score T integrates capability\ndimensions through weight coefficients Wi ∈[0, 1], where\nPm\ni=1 Wi = 1. To account for the varying emphasis of ca-\npabilities in different scenarios, each dimension incorporates\nan adjustment factor βi ∈(0, 1]. Performance in individual\nscenarios is weighted by wj ∈[0, 1], with Pn\nj=1 wj = 1.\nFor statistical robustness, we conduct kj evaluation runs per\nscenario, where Ryjk represents the performance metric from\nthe k-th run. These metrics are normalized using the pre-\ndefined theoretical minimum value minj Ryj and maximum\nvalue maxj Ryj to ensure fair comparison across different\ngaming environments.\n4\nDSGBench - Overview\nDSGBench is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evalu-\nate the strategic decision-making capabilities of LLM-based\nagents through a diverse set of strategy games.\nIt con-\nsists of three key components: complex game environments,\nCapability\nGames\nMetrics\nScenarios\nStrategic Planning\nStarcraft II[Ma et al., 2023b]\nRPM, EER, SUR, TCR\nMacro (Async\/Sync)\nCivilization[Qi et al., 2024]\nEGR, CER, TRP, LUR, MGR\nMap (World)\nDiplomacy[Mukobi et al., 2023]\nCCC, WS\nNegotiation and Alliances\nStratego[Wikipedia, 2024d]\nCPR, TPCV\nRandom Placement\nReal-Time Decision-Making Starcraft II[Ma et al., 2023b]\nAPM, EPM\nRush (Async\/Sync)\nStreet Fighter III[Wikipedia, 2024e]\nAHR, SMHR, HCR\nFast-Paced(Async)\nSocial Reasoning\nDiplomacy[Mukobi et al., 2023]\nBIR\nNegotiation and Alliances\nWerewolf[Bailis et al., 2024a]\nIRP\nSocial Deduction\nTeam Collaboration\nDiplomacy[Mukobi et al., 2023]\nASR, AD\nNegotiation and Alliances\nWerewolf[Bailis et al., 2024a]\nKSR, VSS\nSocial Deduction\nAdaptive Learning\nStarcraft II[Ma et al., 2023b]\nWR, GA\nRandom (Async\/Sync)\nCivilization[Qi et al., 2024]\nWR, GA\nMap (Small-Scale)\nStreet Fighter III[Wikipedia, 2024e]\nWR, GA\nSync\nStratego[Wikipedia, 2024d]\nWR, GA\nFixed Placement\nTable 2: Evaluation metrics and scenarios for assessing LLM-based agents across five key dimensions: strategic planning, real-time decision-\nmaking, social reasoning, team collaboration, and adaptive learning in diverse strategic games.\nfine-grained evaluation metrics, and decision tracking mech-\nanisms. Using a unified Gym interface, DSGBench provides\na standardised interaction model and supports customisable\ngame scenarios, facilitating the integration of new games and\nthe extension of existing ones. Additionally, the framework\nincorporates an automated scoring process that permits the\ncustomisation of scoring tasks as required. For a detailed de-\nscription of the architectural design, please refer to the Ap-\npendix A.\nIn this section, a detailed overview of DSGBench is pro-\nvided, following the sequence outlined in the table 2. Firstly,\nthe core cognitive decision-making abilities of LLM-based\nagents are explored, as outlined in the table. Secondly, the\nevaluation framework is introduced, including fine-grained\nmetrics and decision-tracking mechanisms. To effectively as-\nsess these abilities, a three-part evaluation framework is pro-\nposed, which includes a set of complex strategic games, fine-\ngrained metrics, and decision-tracking mechanisms. Finally,\nthe diverse game scenarios and evaluation tasks designed are\nshowcased, and the code framework for the automated evalu-\nation platform is discussed.\n4.1\nCognitive Decision-Making Capabilities\nIn addressing complex, multifaceted problems, human agents\nrequire the coordinated application of cognitive and adaptive\ncapabilities. According to Dual Systems Cognitive Theory\n[Kahneman, 2011], rational planning and analytical thinking\nrely on ”System 2”, while rapid decision-making is accom-\nplished through the intuitive responses of ”System 1”. The\ncomplementarity of the two allows individuals to make quick\ndecisions and maintain certain goals in dynamic and uncer-\ntain environments. However, in complex situations involv-\ning multiple intelligences, the ability to make decisions col-\nlectively, and individual capabilities alone are often insuffi-\ncient. Distributed Cognition Theory emphasizes that the abil-\nity to reason socially and work in a team stems from the in-\nteraction of the individual with the environment, tools, and\nother subjects[Hutchins, 1995]. Furthermore, Dynamic Deci-\nsion Theory states that, in dynamic environments, individuals\nand groups can adapt their decision-making strategies in re-\nsponse to feedback, thereby exhibiting adaptive behaviours in\nresponse to changing external conditions[Edwards, 1962].\nDrawing inspiration from this human cognitive decision-\nmaking framework, DSGBench constructs a five-dimensional\nassessment system covering the core dimensions of intelligent\ndecision-making: strategic planning (deep analysis by System\n2), real-time decision-making (fast response by System 1), so-\ncial reasoning (distributed interaction mechanism), team col-\nlaboration (multi-agents coordination) and adaptive learning\n(dynamic strategy optimization). The following outlines each\nof these dimensions in detail:\n• Strategic Planning refers to the ability to formulate and\nimplement long-term strategies that are consistent with\noverall goals. This ability includes optimizing resources,\nanticipating future scenarios, and adapting to changing\nenvironments.\n• Real-Time Decision-Making refers to the ability to\nmake effective decisions under time pressure.\nIt in-\nvolves managing competing objectives, processing dy-\nnamic information, and reacting quickly to unpredictable\nchanges.\n• Social Reasoning refers to the ability to understand and\nnavigate interactions in a team or competitive environ-\nment. This ability requires understanding the intentions\nof other agents, predicting their behaviour, and adjusting\nstrategies accordingly.\n• Team Collaboration refers to the ability of agents to\nwork together effectively in a multi-agent environment\nto achieve a common goal. This includes coordinating\nactions, communicating intentions, and solving collec-\ntive problems.\n• Adaptive Learning refers to the ability of an agent to\ncontinuously improve its capabilities by learning from\npast experiences and feedback.\nThis ability includes\nCapability\nSC\nCiv\nSF\nDip\nWer\nStr\nStrategic Planning\nReal-Time Decision-Making\nSocial Reasoning\nTeam Coordination\nAdaptive Learning\nTable 3: Capability requirements across different games.

These games present long-term,\nmultidimensional decision-making challenges and also assess\nfive key dimensions of cognitive decision-making capability\nthrough multifaceted evaluation perspectives. The following\nsections explain the specific challenges posed by the games\nchosen to evaluate these dimensions.\n• StarCraft II[Wikipedia, 2024c] is a complex real-time\nstrategy (RTS) game where players build bases, manage\nresources, raise armies, and destroy enemy bases. LLM-\nbased agents must make efficient decisions, optimize re-\nsource management, engage in strategic planning, and\nadapt to their opponents’ tactics in real-time within a\nrapidly changing and high-pressure environment.\n• Civilization[Wikipedia, 2024a] is a turn-based strat-\negy game where players lead a civilization from ancient\ntimes to the future. The game involves city-building,\nresource management, technological development, cul-\ntural growth, and diplomacy, with the goal of creating a\nstrong, prosperous civilization. LLM-based agents must\nmake long-term decisions, wisely allocate resources,\nplan future development, and engage in complex diplo-\nmatic negotiations.\n• Street Fighter III[Wikipedia, 2024e] is a fast-paced\nfighting game where players control characters with\nunique skills and combos to battle each other. LLM-\nbased agents must make quick decisions, execute pre-\ncise combos, and anticipate and counter their opponents’\nmoves in a high-pressure environment.\n• Diplomacy[Wikipedia, 2024b] is a multiplayer strategy\nboard game where players expand their territory through\nnegotiations, alliances, and betrayals. Each player con-\ntrols a country, and the goal is to gain an advantage\nthrough strategic positioning and diplomatic agreements.\nLLM-based agents must build alliances, manage com-\nplex diplomatic relationships, and predict opponents’ ac-\ntions.\n• Werewolf[Wikipedia, 2024f] is a social reasoning-\nbased multiplayer game where players are secretly as-\nsigned roles, with some being werewolves and others\nvillagers. The werewolves aim to destroy the villagers,\nwhile the villagers must identify the werewolves. LLM-\nbased agents need to make decisions with limited infor-\nmation, assess the credibility of others, and adjust their\nstrategies based on changing social dynamics.\n• Stratego[Wikipedia, 2024d] is a strategic board game\nwhere players move pieces on a board to capture the op-\nponent’s flag. The game emphasizes planning, bluffing,\nand reasoning about the opponent’s strategy. LLM-based\nagents must make decisions with incomplete informa-\ntion, predict their opponents’ actions, and conceal their\nown plans.\nFor a detailed description of the game mechanics, aciton\nspace and other information, please refer to the Appendix B.\n4.3\nFine-Grained Capability Metrics\nIn order to address the limitations of traditional capability\nassessment methods in dynamic and complex environments,\na fine-grained capability metric is introduced. The multiple\nmetrics is motivated by two empirical findings: (1) outcome-\nbased metrics are difficult to capture detailed differences be-\ntween capability dimensions, and (2) gamification assess-\nment requires the establishment of interpretable measurement\nbenchmarks. The metrics in DSGBench are defined based\non expert insights into the core mechanics of each game, en-\nsuring alignment with the key competencies being assessed.\nSpecifically, each metric is chosen to reflect a critical aspect\nthat influences strategic decision-making performance. As il-\nlustrated in Table 2, the proposed methodology first estab-\nlishes a mapping relationship between capability dimensions\nand games at the macro level, and then associates each game\nwith a set of fine-grained metrics at the micro level. More\ndetails of each metric please refer to Appendix B.\nAn example.\nWe take evaluating the Strategic Planning ca-\npability in the game StarCraft II as an example. Efficient re-\nsource management, which involves collecting and allocat-\ning minerals and gases, allows players to sustain their forces,\nwhile supply utilization governs their capacity to deploy units\neffectively.\nBased on these mechanics, fine-grained met-\nrics such as resource management efficiency and supply uti-\nlization are key for assessing a player’s strategic planning.\nSpecifically, Resource Collection Performance (RPM) mea-\nsures the efficiency of resource gathering by calculating the\ntotal amount of minerals and gases collected during the game,\nindicating how well a player manages resources to support\ntheir strategy. The formula for RPM is as follows:\nRPMi =\nT\nX\nt=1\n(collected mineralsi(t) + collected vespenei(t))\n(4)\nIn addition, the Supply Utilization Rate (SUR) evaluates\nunit production efficiency through the ratio of used supply\ncapacity to maximum supply capacity:\nSURi =\nPT\nt=1 supply usedi(t)\nPT\nt=1 supply capi(t)\n(5)\nWhen SUR is higher, it means that players are performing\nmore efficiently in resource management and unit production.\n4.4\nDecision Trajectory Tracking\nAs a complement to the quantitative evaluation, this paper\nintroduces a decision-tracking and behavioural analysis sys-\ntem that combines performance metrics with contextual anal-\nysis to deepen the understanding of LLM decision-making.\nThe system captures key decision points throughout the game,\nlinking them to real-time game states and mission objec-\ntives, thereby revealing underlying strategic reasoning pat-\nterns. Specifically, the analytical framework consists of three\ncore components: (1) action types that categorize specific de-\ncisions, such as resource allocation and unit production; (2)\ndecision contexts that capture the game state and objectives at\neach decision point; and (3) outcomes that assess the impact\nof decisions on game progression.\nThis approach enables the rapid identification of key deci-\nsion points and anomalies, providing insight into the decision\nlogic of LLMs and a basis for optimisation. Action type clas-\nsification helps to analyse the impact of decisions on game\nprogression, while decision contexts clarify the scope of a\nGame\nScene Variables\nScene Count\nDynamic Space\nMulti-goal\nPrompt Structure\nIterations\nStarCraft II[Ma et al., 2023b]\nMode, Opponent strategy, Difficulty level\n6\nHierarchical\n450\nCivilization[Qi et al., 2024]\nMap\n3\nHierarchical\n141\nStreet Fighter III[Wikipedia, 2024e]\nMode, Role\n2\n×\nFlat\n24\nDiplomacy[Mukobi et al., 2023]\nMap, Role\n1\n×\n×\nFlat\n60\nWerewolf[Bailis et al., 2024b]\nRole\n2\n×\n×\nFlat\n32\nStratego[Wikipedia, 2024d]\nMode, Board placement\n2\n×\nFlat\n1270\nTable 4: Overview of Selected Games in DSGBench and Their Core Characteristics.

Outcome analysis evaluates the actual\nimpact of each decision on the game and the final outcome.\nFor a detailed description of the decision trajectory tracking\nmethodology, refer to Section 5.4.\n4.5\nCustomizable Evaluation Scenarios\nDespite the fact that the various strategic games employed in\nDSGBench encompass a broad range of decision-making ca-\npabilities, the fixed game settings may not adequately assess\nan agent’s multi-dimensional capabilities performance in dy-\nnamic environments. Consequently, our benchmark offers the\nflexibility to create customized evaluation scenarios, enabling\nmore targeted assessments based on specific needs and sup-\nporting future scenario expansions.\nAs demonstrated in Table 4, our benchmark facilitates pre-\ncise control over a range of scenario variables, including op-\nponent behaviour patterns, interaction paradigms (e.g., syn-\nchronous vs. asynchronous), prompt engineering approaches,\nand reasoning strategies. These variables can be customised\nto align with the distinct characteristics inherent in each game\ntype. Furthermore, a salient feature of our benchmark is the\nextensive interaction trajectories, with the average number of\niterations ranging from 24 in Street Fighter III to 1270 in\nStratego across different games. This presents a substantial\nchallenge for LLM-based agents, as these extended decision\nsequences require advanced capabilities in contextual learn-\ning, long-term strategic planning, and decision consistency\nacross varied game environments.\n4.6\nImplementation of DSGBench\nThe evaluation framework is an automated and simplified\nplatform designed to evaluate LLM-based agents uniformly.\nThe main component of the framework is the GameM-\nanager, which coordinates the initialization and execution\nphases. It is responsible for configuring the environment and\nthe agent, ensuring a smooth game flow and accurately track-\ning the decision trajectory. The process starts with the Data-\nCollector, which is responsible for collecting the basic con-\nfiguration of the game and the agent, laying the foundation\nfor accurate evaluation. This data is then fed into the modules\nGameEnv and HistoryTracker. While the former manages\nthe action and observation space and enables seamless inter-\naction between the agent and its environment, the latter cap-\ntures the detailed game history and allows for in-depth analy-\nsis of the decision-making process and strategic choices. This\nsetup provides a comprehensive view of the performance of\nLLM-based agents and helps to gain a deeper understanding\nof their behaviour and how the strategy of the agent evolves\nthroughout the game. For a detailed description of the archi-\ntectural design, please refer to Appendix A.\n5\nExperimental Results\nThis section presents the results of the evaluation of the six\nrepresentative LLMs on DSGBench. The following subsec-\ntions describe the evaluation setup, the main experimental re-\nsults, and both quantitative and qualitative results that high-\nlight the strengths and limitations of the models.\n5.1\nEvaluation Setup\nWe evaluated six representative LLMs on DSGBench, in-\ncluding closed-source models (GPT-4o[OpenAI, 2024], GPT-\n3.5-Turbo[OpenAI, 2023], Gemini 1.5 Flash[Reid et al.,\n2024]) and open-source models ( DeepSeek-V2.5[DeepSeek-\nAI,\n2024],\nLlama-3.1-8B-Instruct\nand\nLlama-3.1-70B-\nInstruct[Dubey et al., 2024]).\nScenario Design: The scenarios were designed to include\ncontrollable variables such as opponent strategies, difficulty\nlevels, and interaction modes, with settings that differ be-\ntween games. As illustrated in Table 5, for StarCraft II, the\nkey controllable variables include opponent strategy, execu-\ntion mode (synchronous\/asynchronous), and opponent diffi-\nculty, which is set to medium with integrated AI. In this study,\nthe map is selected as a classic race map. Each scenario will\nundergo a series of experiments to ensure robustness and to\naccount for the variability in agent performance across differ-\nent runs. The configuration settings of other game scenarios\ncan be found in the appendix B.\nExperimental Setup: All evaluations were conducted us-\ning standardized prompts without model fine-tuning to ensure\ntask consistency. For prompt engineering, we adopted ex-\nisting prompt templates for established game environments\n(StarCraft II[Ma et al., 2023b], Civilization[Qi et al., 2024],\nDiplomacy[Mukobi et al., 2023], Werewolf[Bailis et al.,\n2024b], and Street Fighter III[Wikipedia, 2024e]), while de-\nveloping custom prompt structures and reasoning frameworks\nfor Stratego[Wikipedia, 2024d]. The temperature parameter\nwas set to 0.2 across all LLMs to balance response deter-\nminism and creative reasoning optimally. For each game sce-\nnario, we evaluated models against either the built-in AI of the\ngame or GPT4o-mini as opponents, conducting 10 matches\nper scenario to ensure reliability. All game environments are\nuniformly encapsulated as text-based interfaces that imple-\nment standardized “observation-to-promp” and “ response-to-\naction” loops for consistent agent interaction.

For each game scenario, the scores for\neach model are the averages of ten match runs, with both the mean and variance calculated.\nall games employed a text-based action space, where the va-\nlidity of actions was evaluated through the grounding accu-\nracy rate.\n5.2\nQuantitative Results\nThe experimental evaluation of DSGBench highlights distinct\nstrengths and limitations of LLM-based agents in different\nstrategic environments. As shown in Table 6, the quantitative\nresults summarise the models’ capabilities in strategic plan-\nning, real-time decision-making, social reasoning, team col-\nlaboration, and adaptive learning. In addition, the specific for-\nmula for calculating the capability scores is presented in the\nprevious section 3.2. These findings are further elaborated\nbelow, incorporating both quantitative metrics and qualitative\nobservations, culminating in a detailed analysis of decision-\nmaking trajectories.\nFine-grained capability metrics reveal distinct patterns\nin model performance across different cognitive dimen-\nsions. The comprehensive evaluation framework, encompass-\ning strategic planning, real-time decision-making, social rea-\nsoning, team collaboration, and adaptive learning, demon-\nstrates that models exhibit specialised strengths rather than\nuniform capabilities. This specialised performance is partic-\nularly evident in the case of Gemini 1.5 Flash [Reid et al.,\n2024], which achieves exceptional results in strategic plan-\nning (72.88) and adaptive learning (64.23), while showing\nlimitations in real-time decision-making (48.45). In contrast,\nGPT-4o [OpenAI, 2024] exhibits a more balanced set of capa-\nbilities across various metrics. It demonstrates a particularly\nstrong performance in social reasoning (83.27) and team col-\nlaboration (34.31), along with consistent scores above 40 in\nother dimensions.\nThe performance analysis reveals a substantial capa-\nbility gap between closed-source and open-source mod-\nels. Closed-source models have been shown to demonstrate\nsuperior performance, with Gemini 1.5 Flash [Reid et al.,\n2024] and GPT-4o [OpenAI, 2024] achieving overall scores\nof 56.16 and 54.10, respectively. In contrast, open-source al-\nternatives such as DeepSeek-V2.5[DeepSeek-AI, 2024] and\nLlama-3.1-70B-Instruct [Dubey et al., 2024] achieve signifi-\ncantly lower overall scores of 53.75 and 45.11, respectively.\nThe most pronounced disparity is observed in strategic plan-\nning tasks, where Gemini 1.5 Flash[Reid et al., 2024] (72.88)\nsignificantly outperforms Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct[Dubey et\nal., 2024] (51.47). However, in specific scenarios such as\nStarCraft’s real-time decision-making, open-source models\ncan achieve competitive performance, as demonstrated by\nLlama-3.1-70B-Instruct’s[Dubey et al., 2024] high score in\nthat dimension.\nGame-specific analysis further illuminates the relation-\nship between model architecture and task performance.\nIn strategic games such as Civilization, closed-source mod-\nels demonstrate clear advantages, with Gemini 1.5 Flash[Reid\net al., 2024] achieving a high score of 72.88 in strategic\nplanning.\nConversely, GPT-3.5 Turbo[OpenAI, 2023] ex-\nhibits diminished efficacy in this domain, attaining a score\nof 32.94.\nIn contrast, in real-time gaming environments,\nwhere the speed of decision-making is paramount, models\nsuch as Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct demonstrate superior perfor-\nmance with a score of 66.35 in real-time decision-making.\nThe observed variance in performance across different game\ntypes suggests that current model architectures may be opti-\nmised for specific cognitive tasks, potentially at the expense\nof others.\n5.3\nQualitative Analysis\nThe qualitative observations provide a complementary per-\nspective on the models’ capabilities, particularly in dealing\nwith complex, dynamic scenarios. In structured turn-based\nenvironments such as Civilization and Stratego, closed-source\nmodels excel at aligning intermediate decisions with long-\nterm goals. Take GPT-4o[OpenAI, 2024] as an example. It\nexcels at resource prioritisation and foreign policy formula-\ntion, allowing it to outperform open-source models. How-\never, even closed-source models occasionally fail to adapt to\nunforeseen in-game developments, such as unexpected oppo-\nnent strategies.\nIn contrast, real-time environments present a contrasting\nscenario. In StarCraft II, the dynamic nature of the battle-\nfield exposes temporal reasoning limitations across all mod-\nels. Despite its overall proficiency, GPT-3.5-Turbo[OpenAI,\n2023] struggles to balance resource gathering with tactical\ndecision-making under time constraints. Open-source mod-\nels face even greater challenges, frequently failing to respond\neffectively to rapid environmental changes. This behaviour\nunderscores fundamental gaps in the temporal reasoning ca-\npabilities of contemporary LLM architectures.\nSocial reasoning tasks, such as Diplomacy and Were-\nwolf, reveal additional complexities. GPT-4o[OpenAI, 2024]\ndemonstrates reasonable success in forming alliances and\nadapting strategies based on evolving game dynamics. For in-\nstance, it effectively identifies cooperative opportunities while\nmitigating adversarial risks. However, these successes are in-\nconsistent, with models sometimes reverting to overly sim-\nplistic negotiation tactics. Conversely, open-source models\nfrequently generate responses that are either redundant or ir-\nrelevant, thus exposing their limitations in handling complex\nmulti-agent interactions.\nStage\nTrajectory\nStep\nEarly\nDecision:\n0: <TRAIN PROBE>→1: <BUILD PYLON>→2: <BUILD NEXUS>→3: <TRAIN PROBE>→4: <BUILD ASSIMILATOR>\nOur Strategy: Expand the number of workers, build additional resource collection structures, and ensure base defense.

As\nillustrated by Figure 2, the decision trajectory over time is\ncharacterised by shifts in the LLM’s behaviour. For instance,\nat step 15k in Game 1, a significant decrease in EER coin-\ncides with a shift in strategy from resource gathering to mili-\ntary production, as shown in Table 7. Furthermore, EPM in-\ncreases during combat phases, particularly between the ”Mid”\nand ”Late” stages, aligning with higher decision-making com-\nplexity, such as advanced unit production and strategic up-\ngrades. The LLM also demonstrates adaptability by switch-\ning to specialised units such as Void Rays and Immortals in\nresponse to changing game conditions, as reflected in the data\nat step 10k in Table 7.\nThe insights derived from Figure 2 and Table 7 collec-\ntively provide a more precise understanding of the evolution\nof LLM decision-making. The figure provides a visual repre-\nsentation of decision trends, while the table provides specific\ndata points that explain the rationale behind key actions. For\nexample, the drop in EER at level 15k reflects a strategic pivot\ntowards military production, and the increase in EPM at level\n25k corresponds to decisions to expand infrastructure and up-\ngrade units.\n6\nConclusion\nWe introduce DSGBench, a comprehensive benchmark de-\nsigned to evaluate the strategic decision-making capabilities\nof LLM-based agents in diverse and dynamic gaming environ-\nments. For the first time, we assess LLM-based agents based\non key cognitive decision-making dimensions from human\ncognition and propose an integrated evaluation approach. Un-\nder standardized settings, we systematically evaluate the per-\nformance of six representative LLM-based agents in complex\nstrategic environments. Through fine-grained evaluation met-\nrics and decision trajectory analysis, we reveal the strengths\nand weaknesses of agents in various scenarios. Experimen-\ntal results show significant differences across multiple ability\ndimensions. Additionally, we have established a unified eval-\nuation framework that supports the integration of new games\nand the customization and expansion of new game scenarios.\nWe hope that DSGBench will see widespread application, as\ngaming itself is an evolving process.

These advancements highlight the poten-\ntial of LLMs to be employed in more complicated settings\nlike open-world situations and strategic gaming[Wang et al.,\n2023; Ma et al., 2023b]. Nevertheless, applying LLMs in\nsuch environments demands not only a deep understanding of\nthe motivations and potential deceptive tactics of enemies, but\nalso advanced reasoning to anticipate risks and vulnerabilities\n1Please contact twj@nudt.edu.cn if any problem occurs.\nin our strategies. We believe that unlocking this potential re-\nquires further developments in model architectures as well as\nestablishing a rigorous evaluation framework to assess their\ncapabilities[Chang et al., 2024] systematically.\nDespite significant advances in LLM benchmarking, ex-\nisting assessment frameworks suffer from three key limita-\ntions when applied to complicated decision-making settings.\nFirstly, these benchmarks are usually built on environments\nfor static or single-objective tasks [Xie et al., 2024; Zhong\net al., 2023], failing to incorporate real-world dynamic sit-\nuations or constantly changing goals.\nSecondly, common\nevaluation metrics focus extensively on result-oriented per-\nformance like task completion rate and win rate [Liu et al.,\n2023; Xi et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023]. How-\never, most models have near-zero success rates in challenging\nenvironments[Xie et al., 2024], and therefore, overly broad\nassessing scores are difficult to evaluate strengths and weak-\nnesses among LLM-based agents properly.\nFurthermore,\nsome existing works concentrate on single-dimensional capa-\nbilities[Bailis et al., 2024a; Mukobi et al., 2023], which lacks\nsystematic evaluation of core cognitive capabilities which\nare crucial for strategic gaming tasks. Such evaluation re-\nquires to analyze an LLM-based agent from aspects including\nlong-term strategic planning, short-term real-time decision-\nmaking, and social reasoning of external adversaries.\nTo address these challenges, we introduce DSGBench, a\ndiverse strategic game benchmark designed to assess LLM-\nbased agents across multiple dimensions of cognitive and in-\nteractive capabilities. DSGBench is built around three key\ncomponents: a set of diverse and complex strategy games,\na comprehensive evaluation scoring system, and a detailed\ndecision-tracking mechanism. The overall framework of DS-\nGBench is shown in Figure 1. The platform includes six clas-\nsic strategic games which are StarCraft II [Ma et al., 2023a],\nCivilization [Qi et al., 2024], Street Fighter III [Wikipedia,\n2024e], Diplomacy [Mukobi et al., 2023], Werewolf [Bailis\net al., 2024a], and Stratego [Wikipedia, 2024d]. They each\nselected to test specific skill sets, including strategic plan-\nning, real-time decision-making, social reasoning, team col-\nlaboration, and adaptive learning. These games replicate the\ndynamics of the real world through multi-agent interactions,\nlong-context decision-making, and the achievement of vari-\nous sub-goals, providing a varied scene setting that allows for\na comprehensive assessment of agents’ adaptability and cog-\nnitive integration.\nA key feature of DSGBench is its novel evaluation frame-\nwork that incorporates fine-grained metrics to provide a com-\nprehensive view of agent performance across multiple dimen-\nsions. These designed metrics capture the nuances of agent\nbehaviour, particularly in decision-making under uncertainty,\narXiv:2503.06047v1  [cs.AI]  8 Mar 2025\nFigure 1: The overall framework of DSGBench. The framework consists of (1) a multi-game environment supporting both asynchronous\nand synchronous interactions; (2) fine-grained capability metrics for strategic planning, real-time decision-making, and team collaboration;\nand (3) decision trajectory tracking tools that collaboratively analyze agents’ decision-making processes. Through observation-to-prompt and\nresponse-to-action loops, DSGBench enables systematic evaluation of LLM-based agents in dynamic, multi-agent scenarios.\nlong-term strategic planning, and adaptive strategy adjust-\nment. Through this multi-dimensional analysis, DSGBench\nprovides deeper insights into agent capabilities beyond con-\nventional success measures. Additionally, our benchmark in-\ntegrates detailed decision-tracking functionality, offering re-\nsearchers clear visibility into agents’ underlying decision-\nmaking processes. This transparency is essential for improv-\ning model interpretability and advancing agent design.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nLLM-based agents\nLLM-based agents present human-like cognitive abilities to\nsolve decision-making problems.\nIn early applications of\nthe LLMs, they achieved significant success in handling rel-\natively simple tasks such as role-playing and code genera-\ntion[Nijkamp et al., 2022; Park et al., 2023] due to their\nstrong capabilities in instruction following, language com-\nprehension, and generation[Wang et al., 2024b]. As the re-\nsearch progressed, researchers began to focus on how to in-\nteract LLMs with external tools or environments[Schick et\nal., 2023; Tang et al., 2024], where the key technique is\nto provide relevant instruction and environment information\nthrough context, which enables LLM-based agents to gener-\nate executable actions in response to complex tasks. In ad-\ndition, researchers have systematically explored the capabili-\nties of LLM-based agents in perception, memory, decision-\nmaking, and tool use, with application areas ranging from\nweb navigation, software development, and game decision-\nmaking[Wang et al., 2024b; Zhou et al., 2023; Qian et al.,\n2024; Ma et al., 2023b]. Among these advances, the emer-\ngent reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents are particu-\nlarly critical and are an integral part of the decision-making\nprocess[Hao et al., 2024]. Furthermore, it is found that LLMs\nhave demonstrated advanced cognitive capabilities such as\nhuman-like chain-of-thought reasoning, world modeling, and\ntheory of mind[Wei et al., 2022; Hao et al., 2023; Shapira\net al., 2023].\nThese capabilities influence aspects of how\nLLM-based agents respond to changes in adversary strategies,\nhow they make rational decisions in uncertain environments,\nand how they maintain long-term and short-term consistency\nacross successive decision-making processes.\n2.2\nExisting Benchmarks for LLM-based agents\nWith the enhancement of the comprehensive capabilities of\nLLMs, there is a growing trend to evaluate their performance\nin more challenging open-world or complex gaming scenar-\nios. Although static datasets provided effective evaluation in\nearly studies, they failed to reflect the true performance of\nLLMs in dynamic and complex environments [Huang et al.,\n2024; Bai et al., 2023]. To address this limitation, subse-\nquent research has begun to evaluate LLM-based agents in\nexecutable environments, focusing on revealing their capa-\nbilities in an open-ended generation, multi-round interaction,\nand agent-based role-playing[Wang et al., 2024b]. Current\nresearchers have focused on areas such as software develop-\nment, embodied agents, society simulations, gaming, and pol-\nicy making[Hong et al., 2023; Mandi et al., 2024; Kaiya et\nal., 2023; Mukobi et al., 2023], which have provided LLM\nassessments with more authentic and diverse contexts.\nIn particular, strategy games have been widely recog-\nnized as ideal experimental platforms for evaluating decision-\nmaking capabilities of LLM-based agents due to their com-\nplex reasoning requirements and dynamic interaction prop-\nerties [Liu et al., 2023]. They require agents to engage in\nmultistep reasoning, predict the actions of other agents, and\nBenchmark\nComplex\nGame Theory\nFine-Grained\nCapability Metrics\nDecision\nTrajectory Analysis\nReal-Time &\nTurn-Based\nDiverse\n-Scenarios\nAgentBench[Liu et al., 2023]\n✘\n✘\n✘\n✔\n✔\nSmartPlay[Wu et al., 2023]\n✘\n✘\n✘\n✘\n✘\nGameBench[Costarelli et al., 2024]\n✔\n✘\n✘\n✘\n✘\nGTBench[Duan et al., 2024]\n✔\n✘\n✘\n✘\n✘\nMAgIC[Xu et al., 2023]\n✔\n✘\n✘\n✘\n✘\nAgentBoard[Ma et al., 2024]\n✘\n✘\n✔\n✘\n✔\nAgentGym[Xi et al., 2024]\n✘\n✘\n✘\n✔\n✔\nDSGBench(Ours)\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\n✔\nTable 1: Compare various LLM-based agent benchmarks across key dimensions. While most benchmarks, such as GTBench and SmartPlay,\nfocus on specific tasks or dimensions, DSGBench stands out by offering broader support across complex game theory, fine-grained metrics,\ndecision trajectory analysis, and diverse scenarios. This makes it a more suitable option for evaluating LLM-based agents in complex envi-\nronments.\nbalance competing goals under uncertainty, thus simulating\nreal-world challenges. However, as shown in table 1, bench-\nmarks such as GTBench[Duan et al., 2024], SmartPlay[Wu\net al., 2023], and MAgIC[Xu et al., 2023] focus on uni-\ndimensional capabilities, neglecting the integrated cognitive\nskills required to cope with interdependence and uncertainty\nin dynamic environments. In addition, benchmarks such as\nAgentBench[Liu et al., 2023] and GameBench[Costarelli et\nal., 2024] use eventual success as the core metric, which lim-\nits their insight into complex decision-making processes.\n3\nDSGBench - Preliminary\n3.1\nGame Interaction Formulation\nIn DSGBench evaluation, we model agent-environment in-\nteractions as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Pro-\ncess (POMDP), formalized as the quintuple ⟨W, S, A, O, T⟩.\nHere, W denotes the victory condition—the strategic objec-\ntives agents must achieve, such as destroying the opponent’s\nbase in StarCraft II or achieving victory through multiple\npathways (combat conquest, cultural dominance, or scientific\nadvancement) in Civilization. S represents the state space,\nencompassing all observable environmental states within the\ncurrent game. A defines the action space of all legal actions\navailable to an agent per time step, including movement, com-\nbat, dialogue, and negotiation. O comprises the observation\nspace, containing environmental feedback ft that reflects im-\nmediate state changes and responses to agent actions. T rep-\nresents the state transition function S×A →S, mapping how\nthe current state st and agent action at determine the subse-\nquent state st+1.\nSingle-level Inference. Games such as Street Fighter III,\nDiplomacy, Werewolf, and Stratego Games are particularly\nsuited for single-level reasoning due to their centralized state\nand action spaces.\nThe reasoning process is formalized as\npπ(τ) = p(s0)\nT −1\nY\nt=0\np(at|st, ft) · T(st+1|st, at, ft)\n(1)\nwhere pπ(τ) represents the policy trajectory, p(s0) is the\ninitial state distribution, p(at|st, ft) denotes the probabil-\nity of taking action at given state st and feedback ft, and\nT(st+1|st, at, ft) is the state transition function. In single-\nlevel reasoning games, agents can effectively accomplish\ncomplex tasks with simplified state and action reasoning.\nTwo-level Inference. Complex strategy games like Star-\nCraft II and Civilization require agents to handle large obser-\nvation spaces and multi-dimensional tasks through two levels\nof reasoning: high-level strategic planning (for example, re-\nsource management and army deployment) and low-level tac-\ntical decisions (for example, executing micro-operations and\nmanaging local combat).\npπ(τ) = p(s0)\nT −1\nY\nt=0\np(ahigh\nt\n| st, chigh)·\np(alow\nt\n| st, ahigh\nt\n, clow) · T(st+1 | st, alow\nt , ft)\n(2)\nHere, ahigh\nt\nrepresents high-level strategic decisions based\non global policy chigh; alow\nt\ndenotes immediate tactical ac-\ntions guided by local feedback clow, and T(st+1|st, alow\nt\n, ft)\ndefines the state transition function reflecting environmental\nchanges in response to current actions.\n3.2\nCapability Score Computation\nTo compute the scores of the LLMs across different capabil-\nity dimensions, we first establish the mapping between each\ncapability dimension and multiple associated games, where\neach game is linked to a set of fine-grained metrics. The score\nfor each capability dimension is calculated by weighting the\nperformance metrics of the associated games on multiple fine-\ngrained metrics. Its definition is as follows:\nT =\nm\nX\ni=1\nWi · βi ·\n\n\nn\nX\nj=1\nwj ·\n1\nkj\nPkj\nk=1 Ryjk −minj Ryj\nmaxj Ryj −minj Ryj\n\n\n(3)\nwhere the aggregated capability score T integrates capability\ndimensions through weight coefficients Wi ∈[0, 1], where\nPm\ni=1 Wi = 1. To account for the varying emphasis of ca-\npabilities in different scenarios, each dimension incorporates\nan adjustment factor βi ∈(0, 1]. Performance in individual\nscenarios is weighted by wj ∈[0, 1], with Pn\nj=1 wj = 1.\nFor statistical robustness, we conduct kj evaluation runs per\nscenario, where Ryjk represents the performance metric from\nthe k-th run. These metrics are normalized using the pre-\ndefined theoretical minimum value minj Ryj and maximum\nvalue maxj Ryj to ensure fair comparison across different\ngaming environments.\n4\nDSGBench - Overview\nDSGBench is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evalu-\nate the strategic decision-making capabilities of LLM-based\nagents through a diverse set of strategy games.\nIt con-\nsists of three key components: complex game environments,\nCapability\nGames\nMetrics\nScenarios\nStrategic Planning\nStarcraft II[Ma et al., 2023b]\nRPM, EER, SUR, TCR\nMacro (Async\/Sync)\nCivilization[Qi et al., 2024]\nEGR, CER, TRP, LUR, MGR\nMap (World)\nDiplomacy[Mukobi et al., 2023]\nCCC, WS\nNegotiation and Alliances\nStratego[Wikipedia, 2024d]\nCPR, TPCV\nRandom Placement\nReal-Time Decision-Making Starcraft II[Ma et al., 2023b]\nAPM, EPM\nRush (Async\/Sync)\nStreet Fighter III[Wikipedia, 2024e]\nAHR, SMHR, HCR\nFast-Paced(Async)\nSocial Reasoning\nDiplomacy[Mukobi et al., 2023]\nBIR\nNegotiation and Alliances\nWerewolf[Bailis et al., 2024a]\nIRP\nSocial Deduction\nTeam Collaboration\nDiplomacy[Mukobi et al., 2023]\nASR, AD\nNegotiation and Alliances\nWerewolf[Bailis et al., 2024a]\nKSR, VSS\nSocial Deduction\nAdaptive Learning\nStarcraft II[Ma et al., 2023b]\nWR, GA\nRandom (Async\/Sync)\nCivilization[Qi et al., 2024]\nWR, GA\nMap (Small-Scale)\nStreet Fighter III[Wikipedia, 2024e]\nWR, GA\nSync\nStratego[Wikipedia, 2024d]\nWR, GA\nFixed Placement\nTable 2: Evaluation metrics and scenarios for assessing LLM-based agents across five key dimensions: strategic planning, real-time decision-\nmaking, social reasoning, team collaboration, and adaptive learning in diverse strategic games.\nfine-grained evaluation metrics, and decision tracking mech-\nanisms. Using a unified Gym interface, DSGBench provides\na standardised interaction model and supports customisable\ngame scenarios, facilitating the integration of new games and\nthe extension of existing ones. Additionally, the framework\nincorporates an automated scoring process that permits the\ncustomisation of scoring tasks as required. For a detailed de-\nscription of the architectural design, please refer to the Ap-\npendix A.\nIn this section, a detailed overview of DSGBench is pro-\nvided, following the sequence outlined in the table 2. Firstly,\nthe core cognitive decision-making abilities of LLM-based\nagents are explored, as outlined in the table. Secondly, the\nevaluation framework is introduced, including fine-grained\nmetrics and decision-tracking mechanisms. To effectively as-\nsess these abilities, a three-part evaluation framework is pro-\nposed, which includes a set of complex strategic games, fine-\ngrained metrics, and decision-tracking mechanisms. Finally,\nthe diverse game scenarios and evaluation tasks designed are\nshowcased, and the code framework for the automated evalu-\nation platform is discussed.\n4.1\nCognitive Decision-Making Capabilities\nIn addressing complex, multifaceted problems, human agents\nrequire the coordinated application of cognitive and adaptive\ncapabilities. According to Dual Systems Cognitive Theory\n[Kahneman, 2011], rational planning and analytical thinking\nrely on ”System 2”, while rapid decision-making is accom-\nplished through the intuitive responses of ”System 1”. The\ncomplementarity of the two allows individuals to make quick\ndecisions and maintain certain goals in dynamic and uncer-\ntain environments. However, in complex situations involv-\ning multiple intelligences, the ability to make decisions col-\nlectively, and individual capabilities alone are often insuffi-\ncient. Distributed Cognition Theory emphasizes that the abil-\nity to reason socially and work in a team stems from the in-\nteraction of the individual with the environment, tools, and\nother subjects[Hutchins, 1995]. Furthermore, Dynamic Deci-\nsion Theory states that, in dynamic environments, individuals\nand groups can adapt their decision-making strategies in re-\nsponse to feedback, thereby exhibiting adaptive behaviours in\nresponse to changing external conditions[Edwards, 1962].\nDrawing inspiration from this human cognitive decision-\nmaking framework, DSGBench constructs a five-dimensional\nassessment system covering the core dimensions of intelligent\ndecision-making: strategic planning (deep analysis by System\n2), real-time decision-making (fast response by System 1), so-\ncial reasoning (distributed interaction mechanism), team col-\nlaboration (multi-agents coordination) and adaptive learning\n(dynamic strategy optimization). The following outlines each\nof these dimensions in detail:\n• Strategic Planning refers to the ability to formulate and\nimplement long-term strategies that are consistent with\noverall goals. This ability includes optimizing resources,\nanticipating future scenarios, and adapting to changing\nenvironments.\n• Real-Time Decision-Making refers to the ability to\nmake effective decisions under time pressure.\nIt in-\nvolves managing competing objectives, processing dy-\nnamic information, and reacting quickly to unpredictable\nchanges.\n• Social Reasoning refers to the ability to understand and\nnavigate interactions in a team or competitive environ-\nment. This ability requires understanding the intentions\nof other agents, predicting their behaviour, and adjusting\nstrategies accordingly.\n• Team Collaboration refers to the ability of agents to\nwork together effectively in a multi-agent environment\nto achieve a common goal. This includes coordinating\nactions, communicating intentions, and solving collec-\ntive problems.\n• Adaptive Learning refers to the ability of an agent to\ncontinuously improve its capabilities by learning from\npast experiences and feedback.\nThis ability includes\nCapability\nSC\nCiv\nSF\nDip\nWer\nStr\nStrategic Planning\nReal-Time Decision-Making\nSocial Reasoning\nTeam Coordination\nAdaptive Learning\nTable 3: Capability requirements across different games. SC: Star-\nCraft II, Civ: Civilization, SF: Street Fighter III, Dip: Diplomacy,\nWer: Werewolf, Str: Stratergo.\nidentifying patterns, refining strategies, and adapting be-\nhaviours to incorporate new information into subsequent\niterations, and the decision-making process is continu-\nously optimized for continued success.\n4.2\nDiverse Strategic Games\nAs demonstrated in Table 3, a set of strategic games was se-\nlected to ensure that each capability is adequately evaluated,\nwith factors such as game mechanics, difficulty, and other key\naspects being considered. These games present long-term,\nmultidimensional decision-making challenges and also assess\nfive key dimensions of cognitive decision-making capability\nthrough multifaceted evaluation perspectives. The following\nsections explain the specific challenges posed by the games\nchosen to evaluate these dimensions.\n• StarCraft II[Wikipedia, 2024c] is a complex real-time\nstrategy (RTS) game where players build bases, manage\nresources, raise armies, and destroy enemy bases. LLM-\nbased agents must make efficient decisions, optimize re-\nsource management, engage in strategic planning, and\nadapt to their opponents’ tactics in real-time within a\nrapidly changing and high-pressure environment.\n• Civilization[Wikipedia, 2024a] is a turn-based strat-\negy game where players lead a civilization from ancient\ntimes to the future. The game involves city-building,\nresource management, technological development, cul-\ntural growth, and diplomacy, with the goal of creating a\nstrong, prosperous civilization. LLM-based agents must\nmake long-term decisions, wisely allocate resources,\nplan future development, and engage in complex diplo-\nmatic negotiations.\n• Street Fighter III[Wikipedia, 2024e] is a fast-paced\nfighting game where players control characters with\nunique skills and combos to battle each other. LLM-\nbased agents must make quick decisions, execute pre-\ncise combos, and anticipate and counter their opponents’\nmoves in a high-pressure environment.\n• Diplomacy[Wikipedia, 2024b] is a multiplayer strategy\nboard game where players expand their territory through\nnegotiations, alliances, and betrayals. Each player con-\ntrols a country, and the goal is to gain an advantage\nthrough strategic positioning and diplomatic agreements.\nLLM-based agents must build alliances, manage com-\nplex diplomatic relationships, and predict opponents’ ac-\ntions.\n• Werewolf[Wikipedia, 2024f] is a social reasoning-\nbased multiplayer game where players are secretly as-\nsigned roles, with some being werewolves and others\nvillagers. The werewolves aim to destroy the villagers,\nwhile the villagers must identify the werewolves. LLM-\nbased agents need to make decisions with limited infor-\nmation, assess the credibility of others, and adjust their\nstrategies based on changing social dynamics.\n• Stratego[Wikipedia, 2024d] is a strategic board game\nwhere players move pieces on a board to capture the op-\nponent’s flag. The game emphasizes planning, bluffing,\nand reasoning about the opponent’s strategy. LLM-based\nagents must make decisions with incomplete informa-\ntion, predict their opponents’ actions, and conceal their\nown plans.\nFor a detailed description of the game mechanics, aciton\nspace and other information, please refer to the Appendix B.\n4.3\nFine-Grained Capability Metrics\nIn order to address the limitations of traditional capability\nassessment methods in dynamic and complex environments,\na fine-grained capability metric is introduced. The multiple\nmetrics is motivated by two empirical findings: (1) outcome-\nbased metrics are difficult to capture detailed differences be-\ntween capability dimensions, and (2) gamification assess-\nment requires the establishment of interpretable measurement\nbenchmarks. The metrics in DSGBench are defined based\non expert insights into the core mechanics of each game, en-\nsuring alignment with the key competencies being assessed.\nSpecifically, each metric is chosen to reflect a critical aspect\nthat influences strategic decision-making performance. As il-\nlustrated in Table 2, the proposed methodology first estab-\nlishes a mapping relationship between capability dimensions\nand games at the macro level, and then associates each game\nwith a set of fine-grained metrics at the micro level. More\ndetails of each metric please refer to Appendix B.\nAn example.\nWe take evaluating the Strategic Planning ca-\npability in the game StarCraft II as an example. Efficient re-\nsource management, which involves collecting and allocat-\ning minerals and gases, allows players to sustain their forces,\nwhile supply utilization governs their capacity to deploy units\neffectively.\nBased on these mechanics, fine-grained met-\nrics such as resource management efficiency and supply uti-\nlization are key for assessing a player’s strategic planning.\nSpecifically, Resource Collection Performance (RPM) mea-\nsures the efficiency of resource gathering by calculating the\ntotal amount of minerals and gases collected during the game,\nindicating how well a player manages resources to support\ntheir strategy. The formula for RPM is as follows:\nRPMi =\nT\nX\nt=1\n(collected mineralsi(t) + collected vespenei(t))\n(4)\nIn addition, the Supply Utilization Rate (SUR) evaluates\nunit production efficiency through the ratio of used supply\ncapacity to maximum supply capacity:\nSURi =\nPT\nt=1 supply usedi(t)\nPT\nt=1 supply capi(t)\n(5)\nWhen SUR is higher, it means that players are performing\nmore efficiently in resource management and unit production.\n4.4\nDecision Trajectory Tracking\nAs a complement to the quantitative evaluation, this paper\nintroduces a decision-tracking and behavioural analysis sys-\ntem that combines performance metrics with contextual anal-\nysis to deepen the understanding of LLM decision-making.\nThe system captures key decision points throughout the game,\nlinking them to real-time game states and mission objec-\ntives, thereby revealing underlying strategic reasoning pat-\nterns. Specifically, the analytical framework consists of three\ncore components: (1) action types that categorize specific de-\ncisions, such as resource allocation and unit production; (2)\ndecision contexts that capture the game state and objectives at\neach decision point; and (3) outcomes that assess the impact\nof decisions on game progression.\nThis approach enables the rapid identification of key deci-\nsion points and anomalies, providing insight into the decision\nlogic of LLMs and a basis for optimisation. Action type clas-\nsification helps to analyse the impact of decisions on game\nprogression, while decision contexts clarify the scope of a\nGame\nScene Variables\nScene Count\nDynamic Space\nMulti-goal\nPrompt Structure\nIterations\nStarCraft II[Ma et al., 2023b]\nMode, Opponent strategy, Difficulty level\n6\nHierarchical\n450\nCivilization[Qi et al., 2024]\nMap\n3\nHierarchical\n141\nStreet Fighter III[Wikipedia, 2024e]\nMode, Role\n2\n×\nFlat\n24\nDiplomacy[Mukobi et al., 2023]\nMap, Role\n1\n×\n×\nFlat\n60\nWerewolf[Bailis et al., 2024b]\nRole\n2\n×\n×\nFlat\n32\nStratego[Wikipedia, 2024d]\nMode, Board placement\n2\n×\nFlat\n1270\nTable 4: Overview of Selected Games in DSGBench and Their Core Characteristics.

Outcome analysis evaluates the actual\nimpact of each decision on the game and the final outcome.\nFor a detailed description of the decision trajectory tracking\nmethodology, refer to Section 5.4.\n4.5\nCustomizable Evaluation Scenarios\nDespite the fact that the various strategic games employed in\nDSGBench encompass a broad range of decision-making ca-\npabilities, the fixed game settings may not adequately assess\nan agent’s multi-dimensional capabilities performance in dy-\nnamic environments. Consequently, our benchmark offers the\nflexibility to create customized evaluation scenarios, enabling\nmore targeted assessments based on specific needs and sup-\nporting future scenario expansions.\nAs demonstrated in Table 4, our benchmark facilitates pre-\ncise control over a range of scenario variables, including op-\nponent behaviour patterns, interaction paradigms (e.g., syn-\nchronous vs. asynchronous), prompt engineering approaches,\nand reasoning strategies. These variables can be customised\nto align with the distinct characteristics inherent in each game\ntype. Furthermore, a salient feature of our benchmark is the\nextensive interaction trajectories, with the average number of\niterations ranging from 24 in Street Fighter III to 1270 in\nStratego across different games. This presents a substantial\nchallenge for LLM-based agents, as these extended decision\nsequences require advanced capabilities in contextual learn-\ning, long-term strategic planning, and decision consistency\nacross varied game environments.\n4.6\nImplementation of DSGBench\nThe evaluation framework is an automated and simplified\nplatform designed to evaluate LLM-based agents uniformly.\nThe main component of the framework is the GameM-\nanager, which coordinates the initialization and execution\nphases. It is responsible for configuring the environment and\nthe agent, ensuring a smooth game flow and accurately track-\ning the decision trajectory. The process starts with the Data-\nCollector, which is responsible for collecting the basic con-\nfiguration of the game and the agent, laying the foundation\nfor accurate evaluation. This data is then fed into the modules\nGameEnv and HistoryTracker. While the former manages\nthe action and observation space and enables seamless inter-\naction between the agent and its environment, the latter cap-\ntures the detailed game history and allows for in-depth analy-\nsis of the decision-making process and strategic choices. This\nsetup provides a comprehensive view of the performance of\nLLM-based agents and helps to gain a deeper understanding\nof their behaviour and how the strategy of the agent evolves\nthroughout the game. For a detailed description of the archi-\ntectural design, please refer to Appendix A.\n5\nExperimental Results\nThis section presents the results of the evaluation of the six\nrepresentative LLMs on DSGBench. The following subsec-\ntions describe the evaluation setup, the main experimental re-\nsults, and both quantitative and qualitative results that high-\nlight the strengths and limitations of the models.\n5.1\nEvaluation Setup\nWe evaluated six representative LLMs on DSGBench, in-\ncluding closed-source models (GPT-4o[OpenAI, 2024], GPT-\n3.5-Turbo[OpenAI, 2023], Gemini 1.5 Flash[Reid et al.,\n2024]) and open-source models ( DeepSeek-V2.5[DeepSeek-\nAI,\n2024],\nLlama-3.1-8B-Instruct\nand\nLlama-3.1-70B-\nInstruct[Dubey et al., 2024]).\nScenario Design: The scenarios were designed to include\ncontrollable variables such as opponent strategies, difficulty\nlevels, and interaction modes, with settings that differ be-\ntween games. As illustrated in Table 5, for StarCraft II, the\nkey controllable variables include opponent strategy, execu-\ntion mode (synchronous\/asynchronous), and opponent diffi-\nculty, which is set to medium with integrated AI. In this study,\nthe map is selected as a classic race map. Each scenario will\nundergo a series of experiments to ensure robustness and to\naccount for the variability in agent performance across differ-\nent runs. The configuration settings of other game scenarios\ncan be found in the appendix B.\nExperimental Setup: All evaluations were conducted us-\ning standardized prompts without model fine-tuning to ensure\ntask consistency. For prompt engineering, we adopted ex-\nisting prompt templates for established game environments\n(StarCraft II[Ma et al., 2023b], Civilization[Qi et al., 2024],\nDiplomacy[Mukobi et al., 2023], Werewolf[Bailis et al.,\n2024b], and Street Fighter III[Wikipedia, 2024e]), while de-\nveloping custom prompt structures and reasoning frameworks\nfor Stratego[Wikipedia, 2024d]. The temperature parameter\nwas set to 0.2 across all LLMs to balance response deter-\nminism and creative reasoning optimally. For each game sce-\nnario, we evaluated models against either the built-in AI of the\ngame or GPT4o-mini as opponents, conducting 10 matches\nper scenario to ensure reliability. All game environments are\nuniformly encapsulated as text-based interfaces that imple-\nment standardized “observation-to-promp” and “ response-to-\naction” loops for consistent agent interaction.

Additionally, the Overall Score is the weighted sum of the\nevaluation scores across these five capabilities, with both mean and standard deviation for each model. For each game scenario, the scores for\neach model are the averages of ten match runs, with both the mean and variance calculated.\nall games employed a text-based action space, where the va-\nlidity of actions was evaluated through the grounding accu-\nracy rate.\n5.2\nQuantitative Results\nThe experimental evaluation of DSGBench highlights distinct\nstrengths and limitations of LLM-based agents in different\nstrategic environments. As shown in Table 6, the quantitative\nresults summarise the models’ capabilities in strategic plan-\nning, real-time decision-making, social reasoning, team col-\nlaboration, and adaptive learning. In addition, the specific for-\nmula for calculating the capability scores is presented in the\nprevious section 3.2. These findings are further elaborated\nbelow, incorporating both quantitative metrics and qualitative\nobservations, culminating in a detailed analysis of decision-\nmaking trajectories.\nFine-grained capability metrics reveal distinct patterns\nin model performance across different cognitive dimen-\nsions. The comprehensive evaluation framework, encompass-\ning strategic planning, real-time decision-making, social rea-\nsoning, team collaboration, and adaptive learning, demon-\nstrates that models exhibit specialised strengths rather than\nuniform capabilities. This specialised performance is partic-\nularly evident in the case of Gemini 1.5 Flash [Reid et al.,\n2024], which achieves exceptional results in strategic plan-\nning (72.88) and adaptive learning (64.23), while showing\nlimitations in real-time decision-making (48.45). In contrast,\nGPT-4o [OpenAI, 2024] exhibits a more balanced set of capa-\nbilities across various metrics. It demonstrates a particularly\nstrong performance in social reasoning (83.27) and team col-\nlaboration (34.31), along with consistent scores above 40 in\nother dimensions.\nThe performance analysis reveals a substantial capa-\nbility gap between closed-source and open-source mod-\nels. Closed-source models have been shown to demonstrate\nsuperior performance, with Gemini 1.5 Flash [Reid et al.,\n2024] and GPT-4o [OpenAI, 2024] achieving overall scores\nof 56.16 and 54.10, respectively. In contrast, open-source al-\nternatives such as DeepSeek-V2.5[DeepSeek-AI, 2024] and\nLlama-3.1-70B-Instruct [Dubey et al., 2024] achieve signifi-\ncantly lower overall scores of 53.75 and 45.11, respectively.\nThe most pronounced disparity is observed in strategic plan-\nning tasks, where Gemini 1.5 Flash[Reid et al., 2024] (72.88)\nsignificantly outperforms Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct[Dubey et\nal., 2024] (51.47). However, in specific scenarios such as\nStarCraft’s real-time decision-making, open-source models\ncan achieve competitive performance, as demonstrated by\nLlama-3.1-70B-Instruct’s[Dubey et al., 2024] high score in\nthat dimension.\nGame-specific analysis further illuminates the relation-\nship between model architecture and task performance.\nIn strategic games such as Civilization, closed-source mod-\nels demonstrate clear advantages, with Gemini 1.5 Flash[Reid\net al., 2024] achieving a high score of 72.88 in strategic\nplanning.\nConversely, GPT-3.5 Turbo[OpenAI, 2023] ex-\nhibits diminished efficacy in this domain, attaining a score\nof 32.94.\nIn contrast, in real-time gaming environments,\nwhere the speed of decision-making is paramount, models\nsuch as Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct demonstrate superior perfor-\nmance with a score of 66.35 in real-time decision-making.\nThe observed variance in performance across different game\ntypes suggests that current model architectures may be opti-\nmised for specific cognitive tasks, potentially at the expense\nof others.\n5.3\nQualitative Analysis\nThe qualitative observations provide a complementary per-\nspective on the models’ capabilities, particularly in dealing\nwith complex, dynamic scenarios. In structured turn-based\nenvironments such as Civilization and Stratego, closed-source\nmodels excel at aligning intermediate decisions with long-\nterm goals. Take GPT-4o[OpenAI, 2024] as an example. It\nexcels at resource prioritisation and foreign policy formula-\ntion, allowing it to outperform open-source models. How-\never, even closed-source models occasionally fail to adapt to\nunforeseen in-game developments, such as unexpected oppo-\nnent strategies.\nIn contrast, real-time environments present a contrasting\nscenario. In StarCraft II, the dynamic nature of the battle-\nfield exposes temporal reasoning limitations across all mod-\nels. Despite its overall proficiency, GPT-3.5-Turbo[OpenAI,\n2023] struggles to balance resource gathering with tactical\ndecision-making under time constraints. Open-source mod-\nels face even greater challenges, frequently failing to respond\neffectively to rapid environmental changes. This behaviour\nunderscores fundamental gaps in the temporal reasoning ca-\npabilities of contemporary LLM architectures.\nSocial reasoning tasks, such as Diplomacy and Were-\nwolf, reveal additional complexities. GPT-4o[OpenAI, 2024]\ndemonstrates reasonable success in forming alliances and\nadapting strategies based on evolving game dynamics. For in-\nstance, it effectively identifies cooperative opportunities while\nmitigating adversarial risks. However, these successes are in-\nconsistent, with models sometimes reverting to overly sim-\nplistic negotiation tactics. Conversely, open-source models\nfrequently generate responses that are either redundant or ir-\nrelevant, thus exposing their limitations in handling complex\nmulti-agent interactions.\nStage\nTrajectory\nStep\nEarly\nDecision:\n0: <TRAIN PROBE>→1: <BUILD PYLON>→2: <BUILD NEXUS>→3: <TRAIN PROBE>→4: <BUILD ASSIMILATOR>\nOur Strategy: Expand the number of workers, build additional resource collection structures, and ensure base defense.

As\nillustrated by Figure 2, the decision trajectory over time is\ncharacterised by shifts in the LLM’s behaviour. For instance,\nat step 15k in Game 1, a significant decrease in EER coin-\ncides with a shift in strategy from resource gathering to mili-\ntary production, as shown in Table 7. Furthermore, EPM in-\ncreases during combat phases, particularly between the ”Mid”\nand ”Late” stages, aligning with higher decision-making com-\nplexity, such as advanced unit production and strategic up-\ngrades. The LLM also demonstrates adaptability by switch-\ning to specialised units such as Void Rays and Immortals in\nresponse to changing game conditions, as reflected in the data\nat step 10k in Table 7.\nThe insights derived from Figure 2 and Table 7 collec-\ntively provide a more precise understanding of the evolution\nof LLM decision-making. The figure provides a visual repre-\nsentation of decision trends, while the table provides specific\ndata points that explain the rationale behind key actions. For\nexample, the drop in EER at level 15k reflects a strategic pivot\ntowards military production, and the increase in EPM at level\n25k corresponds to decisions to expand infrastructure and up-\ngrade units.\n6\nConclusion\nWe introduce DSGBench, a comprehensive benchmark de-\nsigned to evaluate the strategic decision-making capabilities\nof LLM-based agents in diverse and dynamic gaming environ-\nments. For the first time, we assess LLM-based agents based\non key cognitive decision-making dimensions from human\ncognition and propose an integrated evaluation approach. Un-\nder standardized settings, we systematically evaluate the per-\nformance of six representative LLM-based agents in complex\nstrategic environments. Through fine-grained evaluation met-\nrics and decision trajectory analysis, we reveal the strengths\nand weaknesses of agents in various scenarios. Experimen-\ntal results show significant differences across multiple ability\ndimensions. Additionally, we have established a unified eval-\nuation framework that supports the integration of new games\nand the customization and expansion of new game scenarios.\nWe hope that DSGBench will see widespread application, as\ngaming itself is an evolving process. Agents can continuously\nlearn and evolve through interaction with opponents, making\ngame-based evaluation methods virtually limitless in poten-\ntial.\nWhile existing agents face significant challenges in DSG-\nBench, this analytical framework provides a concrete analysis\nfor the improvement of LLM-based agents’ integrated cogni-\ntive decision-making capabilities. Two important directions\nfor future research include the development of a unified tra-\njectory dataset for strategy games and the creation of an agent\nreasoning framework for multi-strategy games. The trajec-\ntory dataset would serve as a rich resource for training agents\nacross a range of strategic environments. Together, these will\nenhance the generalization capabilities of LLM-based agents\nand further the development of more complex AGI-oriented\nsystems.\n```\n\n#### 5. 学生问题\n问题1：介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」\n问题2：这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？\n问题3：这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？\n\n\n请输出论文总结\n### 输出格式（输出语言用中文）\n```\n## 💡 解答问题1 (...复述学生问题1...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (...复述学生问题2...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (...复述学生问题3...)\n...\n```\n","llm_summary_res":"## 🌟 论文解读 | DSGBench：评估大型语言模型在复杂决策环境中的战略决策能力\n\n## 📌 背景痛点\/本文动机\n随着大型语言模型（LLM）在解决复杂和动态任务方面的能力日益增强，评估这些模型在复杂决策任务中的实际能力变得至关重要。然而，现有的评估系统通常只关注单一目标任务或使用过于宽泛的评估指标，无法全面评估LLM模型在复杂决策任务中的实际能力。\n\n## 🚀 核心方法\n💡 创新点1：DSGBench是一个更严格的评估平台，用于评估战略决策能力。它包含了六个复杂的战略游戏，这些游戏因其长期和多维度的决策需求以及定制各种难度级别或多个目标的任务的灵活性而成为理想的测试平台。\n\n💡 创新点2：DSGBench采用了一种细粒度的评估评分系统，通过考察在五个特定维度中的表现来检查决策能力，并以一种精心设计的方式提供全面的评估。此外，DSGBench还包含一个自动化的决策跟踪机制，能够深入分析代理的行为模式和策略的变化。\n\n## 📈 实验结果\nDSGBench通过应用于多个流行的LLM模型，展示了其在选择LLM模型以及改进其未来发展方面的价值。实验结果表明，DSGBench能够提供有价值的见解，帮助研究人员更好地理解LLM模型在不同决策环境中的表现。\n\n## 💬 可借鉴之处\nDSGBench为评估LLM模型在复杂决策环境中的战略决策能力提供了一个全面的框架。其细粒度的评估指标和决策跟踪机制可以帮助研究人员深入了解LLM模型的行为模式和策略变化，从而更好地改进模型的设计和开发。此外，DSGBench的灵活性和可定制性使其能够适应不同的评估需求，为LLM模型的研究和应用提供了有力的支持。","llm_summary_res_status":200,"order":1,"query_answer":"## 💡 解答问题1 (介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」)\n\n这篇论文提出的benchmark名为DSGBench，它是一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在复杂决策环境中战略决策能力的平台。DSGBench包含了六个复杂的战略游戏，这些游戏因其长期和多维度的决策需求以及定制各种难度级别或多个目标的任务的灵活性而成为理想的测试平台。DSGBench采用了一种细粒度的评估评分系统，通过考察在五个特定维度中的表现来检查决策能力，并以一种精心设计的方式提供全面的评估。此外，DSGBench还包含一个自动化的决策跟踪机制，能够深入分析代理的行为模式和策略的变化。\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？)\n\n论文中并未明确指出DSGBench运行所需的设备条件，例如GPU数量和内存大小。通常这类评估平台需要较高的计算资源，特别是当涉及到多个LLM模型和复杂游戏环境时。至于本文中模型训练和推理所使用的设备，论文中也没有提供具体信息。不过，考虑到LLM模型的计算需求，通常需要高性能的计算集群，配备多块GPU和足够的内存。\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？)\n\nDSGBench采用了细粒度的评估评分系统，通过考察在五个特定维度中的表现来检查决策能力，并以一种精心设计的方式提供全面的评估。这种评估方式不仅关注结果，也关注过程，从而减少了reward hacking的可能性。此外，DSGBench还包含一个自动化的决策跟踪机制，能够深入分析代理的行为模式和策略的变化，这为RL类模型提供了更多的学习机会。因此，DSGBench的环境设计有利于RL类模型在这个benchmark上表现出色。","query_answer_status":200}

To address these challenges, we\npropose TMGBENCH1, a benchmark characterized by comprehensive game type\ncoverage, novel and diverse scenarios, and flexible game organization. Specifi-\ncally, we incorporate all 144 game types summarized by the Robinson-Goforth\ntopology of 2×2 games, which are constructed as classic games in our benchmark.\nFurthermore, we employ synthetic data generation techniques to create diverse,\nhigher-quality game scenarios through topic guidance and human inspection for\neach classic game, which we refer to as story-based games.

We conducted a\ncomprehensive evaluation of mainstream LLMs, covering tests on rational rea-\nsoning, reasoning robustness, Theory-of-Mind capabilities, and reasoning in com-\nplex game forms. The results revealed that LLMs still have flaws in the accuracy\nand consistency of strategic reasoning processes, and their levels of mastery over\nTheory-of-Mind also vary. Additionally, o1-mini, the latest reasoning model from\nOpenAI, was also evaluated across the sequential, parallel, and nested game struc-\ntures and reached accuracy rates of 66.6%, 60.0%, and 70.0%, respectively, high-\nlighting the challenges posed by TMGBENCH.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nThe rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has reshaped the paradigm of artificial\nintelligence, achieving breakthroughs across various domains (Zhao et al., 2023; Huang & Chang,\n2022; Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022; Paranjape et al., 2023). These achievements\nare largely attributed to LLMs’ ability to assimilate vast amounts of knowledge during training,\nemerging with the capacity to organize information at a coarse level and link knowledge at a fine-\ngrained level through their internal representations (Min et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023). These core\ncapabilities have driven the success of LLMs in numerous reasoning tasks, including mathematical\nreasoning (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023), commonsense reasoning (Sap et al., 2019;\nBisk et al., 2020), logical reasoning (Lei et al., 2023), and strategic reasoning (Lor`e & Heydari,\n∗Work done during an internship at the University of Hong Kong.\n†Corresponding Author.\n1The dataset and evaluation codes will be available at https:\/\/github.com\/PinkEx\/TMGBench.\n1\narXiv:2410.10479v1  [cs.AI]  14 Oct 2024\nTMGBENCH\n2023; Duan et al., 2024). Among these, strategic reasoning has attracted considerable attention due\nto its multi-agent nature and close association with social intelligence (Gandhi et al., 2023).\nStrategic reasoning refers to the cognitive process of anticipating, planning, and responding to\nothers’ actions to achieve specific objectives within competitive or cooperative contexts (Zhang\net al., 2024a).\nConsequently, game scenarios—naturally involving both cooperation and com-\npetition—have intuitively become a fertile ground for studying LLMs’ strategic reasoning abili-\nties (Brookins & DeBacker, 2023). In particular, researchers have engaged LLMs in game-playing,\nanalyzing their decision-making behaviors and evaluating their strategic intelligence in such scenar-\nios (Duan et al., 2024). The Prisoner’s Dilemma, as one of the most classic game theory scenarios,\nhas been extensively studied in this context (Herr et al., 2024). Additionally, other traditional games\nsuch as the Battle of the Sexes (Kreps, 1990), the Stag Hunt (Carlsson & Van Damme, 1993), and\nthe Dictator Game (Forsythe et al., 1994) have also drawn significant attention. These studies pro-\nvide initial insights into the strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs (Horton, 2023; Brookins &\nDeBacker, 2023; Phelps & Russell, 2023; Akata et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Aher et al., 2022).\nHowever, current research has three major limitations, hindering a comprehensive, robust, and sus-\ntainable evaluation of LLMs’ strategic reasoning capabilities: (1) Limited coverage of game types:\nMost studies focus on a handful of classic games without considering the full diversity of game\nstructures. (2) Potential risk of game scenario leakage: Classic game scenarios are likely to be\npresent in the training corpus, raising concerns over data leakage. (3) Poor extensibility of game\nforms: Existing studies primarily focus on a narrow range of game forms, which may no longer\nsuffice to challenge high-performing LLMs such as o1-mini from OpenAI.\nTo address the above issues, we introduce TMGBENCH, a benchmark that encompasses a com-\nprehensive range of game types, features synthesized game scenarios, and supports scalable and\nreorganizable game forms. Specifically, to address the first issue, we include all 144 game types de-\nfined by the Robinson-Goforth topology of 2x2 games (Robinson & Goforth, 2005). This topology\nencompasses a variety of game structures based on different numerical payoff matrices, including\nbut not limited to classic games like the Prisoner’s Dilemma(§2.2). To address the second issue, we\nemploy synthetic data generation techniques to create five different story-based games for each clas-\nsic game. In essence, a story-based game is a contextual framing counterpart of its corresponding\nclassic game, sharing the same structure but differing in context (Lor`e & Heydari, 2023). To ensure\nhigh-quality data synthesis, we introduce two additional steps: topic control and human inspection.\nWe first define a set of topics commonly associated with cooperation and competition, such as busi-\nness and law, to guide the data generation process. Then, to ensure that the synthesized games meet\nthe required game structures and are easily understandable, we conduct rigorous human inspection\n(§2.3). To address the third issue, we propose three forms for expanding and organizing games:\nsequential, parallel, and nested. Using the above constructed games as atomic units, we reorganize\nthem into these complex forms to assess the strategic reasoning of LLMs. The sequential and par-\nallel forms evaluate the model’s capacity for sequential and parallel decision-making, respectively,\nwhile the nested form explores the LLMs’ multi-layered strategic reasoning abilities (§2.4).\nBased on TMGBENCH, we conduct comprehensive analyses and evaluations of current mainstream\nLLMs (§3), including assessments of rational reasoning, reasoning robustness, Theory-of-Mind\n(ToM) capabilities, and reasoning in complex game forms, leading to the following key findings:\n(1) Advanced LLMs like gpt-4o demonstrate strong strategic reasoning, with an accuracy rate over\n80%, but struggle to generalize across various contexts and scenarios. Models like claude-3-5-sonnet\nfurther reveal this inconsistency, with performance variability marked by coefficients nearing 0.5.\n(2) Although GPT models often perform well, their reasoning inconsistencies on certain task sub-\ntypes are marked by an asymmetric pattern, which is the main cause of the statistical biases.\n(3) Several top-tier LLMs demonstrate stable first-order ToM abilities, with some effectively uti-\nlizing second-order ToM for comparable tasks. In contrast, models such as Llama-3.1-70B appear\nrestricted to first-order reasoning.\n(4) Complex-form games that are derived from atomic units in TMGBENCH present considerable\nchallenges for LLMs, including those with strong reasoning abilities like o1-mini from OpenAI,\nwhich often struggle as the number of games increases.\n2\nTMGBENCH\nRobinson-Goforth \nTopology\nPd\nB1\nB2\nA1\n4\n3\n1\n3\nA2\n2\n1\n2\n4\nGame Structure\n(e.g. Prisoner’s \nDilemma, PD)\nSarah\ncoffee shop owner\nMark\ncoffee chain entrepreneur\nKeep \nprices\nLower \nprices\nMaintain \noperations\nExpand \nbusiness\nContextual\nFraming\nDirect Answer\nChain of Thought\nFirst-order ToM\nSecond-order ToM\nLLM’s answer\nstandard answer\nDIFF\nData Preparation\nEvaluation\nIt will be the best \nif Sarah keeps \nprices steady, I \ncan maximize \nprofits by \nmaintain \noperations then ...\nKeeps prices \nsteady would be \nbetter, and Mark \nmust be \nreluctant to \nexpand his \nbusiness ...\n```python\nanswer= …\n```\nPython-style \nrequired answer\nBusiness\nPolitics\nTransportation\nGPT-4o\nAssisted\nFigure 1: An concept map of TMGBENCH.\nThe data preparation of the benchmark in-\ncludes 3 ingredients: Robinson-Goforth topol-\nogy, game structure and contextual framing.\nThe evaluation of the benchmark embraces\nseveral prompting methods (including ToM\npromptings) to elicit strategic reasoning pro-\ncess of LLMs.\nSequential\nParallel\nNested\npre-game\ngame1\ngame2\ngame3\ngame1\ngame2\ngame3\nNE\ncore-game\nNE\nif:\npre-game\nthen:\ncore-game\nnew NE of  the \npre-game:\nCondition\nGame Pair\nFigure 2: We design several complex forms of\nstrategic reasoning tasks using TMGBENCH.\nwhich include:\n(1) sequential form, where\nLLMs are required to response multiple game\ntasks in a row, with history of previous tasks; (2)\nparallel form, where LLMs are required to re-\nsponse multiple game tasks simultaneously; (3)\nnested form, where LLMs are required to re-\nsponse a set of interlinked game tasks (in our\nsettings, we relate to them as pre-game and\ncore-game).\nGames in the complex forms\ncan be selected with different game structures\nand various contexts.\n2\nTMGBENCH\n2.1\nBENCHMARK OVERVIEW\nTMGBENCH is a benchmark designed to evaluate the strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs in\ngame-theoretic scenarios, illustrated by Figure 1. It comprehensively covers 144 types of games\n(see §2.2), with each type containing multiple instances (in each instance, there are two players and\neach player can choose between two strategies, resulting in four possible situations), which can be\ncategorized into classic and story-based settings. Notably, the story-based instances are produced\nusing synthetic data generation techniques and are grounded in real-life themes, effectively mitigat-\ning the issue of data leakage (see §2.3). Furthermore, each game in TMGBENCH can be treated as\nan atomic unit, and multiple atomic games can be structured in a more complex task with parallel,\nsequential, or nested form (see §2.4). These complex scenarios effectively facilitate the evaluation\nof advanced LLMs’ abilities in parallel, sequential, and multi-layered decision-making. To precisely\nevaluate the reasoning abilities of LLMs, we use their performance in inferring the optimal strategy\ncombination, i.e., the Nash equilibrium, as the evaluation criterion. Additionally, the designed eval-\nuation metrics provide a fine-grained assessment of the robustness and self-consistency of LLMs’\nstrategic reasoning abilities (see §2.5).\n2.2\nGAME TOPOLOGY\nAlthough previous research has explored LLMs’ reasoning abilities within the context of game the-\nory, existing studies have primarily focused on a few well-known games, such as the Prisoner’s\nDilemma, Battle of the Sexes, and Stag Hunt (Brookins & DeBacker, 2023; Phelps & Russell, 2023;\nGuo, 2023). However, these studies cover a limited game types, resulting in incomplete evaluations.\nThereby, a broader variety of games is urgently needed to conduct a systematic assessment of LLMs.\nTo address this, we incorporate 144 game types (we later refer to a type as an equivalence class)\nbased on the Robinson-Goforth topology of 2×2 games (Robinson & Goforth, 2005). Classic games\nlike the Prisoner’s Dilemma belong to one of the equivalence classes within this topology. Specif-\n3\nTMGBENCH\nPractical Map\nStandard Map\nInconsistency Map\nFigure 3: Demonstration of the inconsistency\nheat map. Each grid is divided into 4 quarter-\ngrids, indicating the 4 situations. By subtract-\ning the standard map from the practical map\nelement-wise, we get the inconsistency map,\nwhere blue indicate positive difference and red\nindicate negative difference.\nThe deeper the\ncolour means the larger the difference between\nthe LLM’s response and the standard answer.\nv\nFigure 4: Axisymmetry in heat maps is illus-\ntrated by the left sub-figure, where the standard\nheat map exhibits perfect axisymmetry across\nthe counter-diagonal. In contrast, LLMs’ re-\nsponses tend to show quasi-axisymmetry, as\nshown by the right sub-figure. Certain pairs of\npositions fail to align precisely when reflected\nacross the axis and may exhibit discrepancies,\ndeviating from the ideal symmetric pattern.\nically, the topology of 2×2 games elegantly illustrates the relationships among strictly ordinal 2×2\ngames, each with a unique payoff structure, leading to different dominant strategies, Nash equilibria,\nand reasoning approaches (more details in Appendix B.1). We categorize all the 144 games with\nnumerical payoffs from the original topology into the classic setting tasks. Due to space constraints,\nwe provide an introduction to the Robinson-Goforth topology in Appendix B.2.\n2.3\nCONTEXTUAL FRAMING\nRelying on the Robinson-Goforth topology, we can systematically construct all types of classic\nsetting tasks. However, this alone is insufficient, as games often take place in diverse real-life\ncontexts, involving different topics, types of participants and their preferences. Such contextual\nframing of games introduces new challenges for LLMs (Lor`e & Heydari, 2023).\nTo further explore LLMs’ strategic reasoning capabilities in real-world scenarios, we use classic\ngames as seed data and employ synthetic data generation techniques, leveraging GPT-4o to construct\nstory-based setting tasks. Specifically, in story-based setting tasks, we replace the pure game infor-\nmation of classic setting tasks with real-life scenarios, covering topics such as business, law and\ntransportation. Additionally, the two players are substituted with characters representing broader\nsemantics (e.g., people, animals, organizations, and even nations), and the payoff values are trans-\nformed from pure numbers into specific states or rewards relevant to the characters. For each classic\nsetting task, we generate 5 corresponding story-based setting tasks.\nTo ensure high-quality data generation, we undertake the following steps: First, we use GPT-4o\nto synthesize the contextual data. Second, we design precise prompts to ensure the generated data\nadhere to the given game structures. Third, we select topics from real-life scenarios where strategic\ninteractions are common, guiding the data generation process. Finally, we conduct rigorous human\nreviews to ensure the data’s quality and diversity.\nMore details on the data generation process, prompts, human review procedures, and topic distribu-\ntion of the data can be found in Appendix C.\n2.4\nCOMPLEX FORMS\nThe 2×2 games in the topology represent a highly condensed game structure. However, in real\nlife, we often encounter more complex game forms, such as making continuous decisions, making\nmultiple decisions simultaneously, or considering the impacts of one decision on another.\nTo evaluate LLMs’ strategic reasoning abilities with more constraints, we treat the aforementioned\nindividual games as atomic games and expand them in three forms: sequential, parallel, and nested.\nThe organization of these forms is illustrated in Figure 2. Specifically, in the sequential form, we\nrandomly sample multiple games from the story-based games, requiring the LLM to make decisions\nsequentially. Only if the LLM provides correct answers for all games is it considered to have made\ncorrect decisions. In the parallel form, the LLM is given multiple randomly sampled games and\n4\nTMGBENCH\nmust make decisions simultaneously. Similarly, the LLM is deemed to have made correct decisions\nonly if it solves all games correctly. In the nested form, we randomly sample two games, desig-\nnated as the pre-game and the core-game, where the core-game holds greater importance.\nThe decisions made by the LLM in the pre-game affect the strategy space in the core-game.\nThus, the LLM is judged to have made correct decisions only if it demonstrates forward-looking\nreasoning by choosing a sub-optimal solution in the pre-game to achieve the optimal solution in\nthe core-game. We demonstrate a template to generate an nested form game in Appendix D.3.\nTheoretically, using these atomic games, we can expand the framework to generate infinitely many\nincreasingly complex game forms, thereby providing a continuous benchmark for evaluating the\nperformance of more advanced LLMs.\n2.5\nEVALUATION METRICS\nAs explained in Section 2.2, our benchmark are perfectly suitable to display in a 12x12 square table,\neach grid representing one of the 144 equivalence classes. In the evaluation process we conduct\nrepetitive tests in every data point of each equivalence class. Each test starts with the input of the\nsetting (classic\/story-based) and the question, and ends with LLM’s response containing a list of\nchoices corresponding to multiple choices or no choice (when the given list is empty).\nNotation. For notation, we assign Freqi,j,o as the frequency of the o-th choice happening to be in\nthe tests of the grid at i-th row, j-th column, where the 1, 2, 3 and 4-th choice correspond to the\nupper-left, upper-right, lower-left and lower-right quarter-grid respectively.\nInconsistency Heat Map. According to conclusions of the Robinson-Goforth topology (Robinson\n& Goforth, 2005), we convert the standard answer of each equivalence class into a heat map named\nthe standard heat map, with the coloured quarter-grid to be the choice in the standard answer. Simi-\nlarly, as for practical result provide by LLMs, we set the value of Freqi,j,o as the colour depth of each\nquarter grid, which builds up the practical heat map. Naturally, we subtract the standard heat map\nfrom the practical heat map in an element-wise manner to get the inconsistency heat map, which is\na standardised tool for our evaluation, shown in Figure 3.\nInconsistency Degree. In order to display the quantified performance of LLMs, we extract inconsis-\ntency degree from a map, which helps reveal the gap between LLMs’ response and standard answer,\nand it is defined as\nID =\n1\n144\n12\nX\ni=1\n12\nX\nj=1\n1\n4\n4\nX\no=1\n∆Freq2\ni,j,o\nwhere ∆Freqi,j,o indicates the the difference (between the LLM’s answer and the standard answer)\nof frequency of the o-th choice at i-th row, j-th column.\nBias Degree. Owing to the symmetric property of the topology framework of 2×2 matrix games, the\ndistribution of answers over the heat map has axial symmetry by the counter-diagonal (Figure 4).\nMotivated by this elegant property, we set up another metric to evaluate the bias degree of LLMs’\nanswers, which we expect robuster LLMs to display lower degrees of bias. The bias degree reflects\nthe stability and symmetry of LLMs’ strategy, and it is defined as\nBD =\n1\n144\n12\nX\ni=1\n12\nX\nj=1\n1\n4\n4\nX\no=1\n(Freqi,j,o −Freqj,i,refo)2\nwhere the meaning of refo is the index of choice o’s counterpart considering the reflection operation\nby the counter-diagonal, and we have the mapping relation: {1, 2, 3, 4} 7→{4, 2, 3, 1}. (e.g. ref1 =\n4 means that the reflection counterpart of choice 1 is choice 4, vice versa)\nPerfect Accuracy Rate. In addition to the metrics mentioned above, we also set up a more rigorous\nmetric named perfect accuracy rate, which ignores the partially correct answer and only considers\nperfectly correct answer in each test, and it is defined as\nPAR =\n1\n144\n12\nX\ni=1\n12\nX\nj=1\n1\nT\nT\nX\nt=1\nI{rspt,i,j = stdi,j}\n5\nTMGBENCH\nTable 1: Overall statistics of LLMs’ performance on classic setting tasks.

As a matter of fact, within the topology, different equivalence classes have\ndifferent number of Nash equilibria (ranging from {0, 1, 2}), leading to a discrepancy in reasoning\ndifficulty, therefore we propose metrics with subscript that represents for different types of equiva-\nlence groups (we refer them to 0-task, 1-task, 2-task respectively), which we refer to as sub-metrics.\nTherefore we have IDn, BDn, PARn(n = 0, 1, 2) which means the inconsistency degree, the bias\ndegree, and the perfect accuracy rate across all equivalence classes that have n equilibra.\n3\nANALYSIS\n3.1\nOVERVIEW OF LLMS’ PERFORMANCE\nOverall, we select several SOTA models according to Open LLM Leaderboard (Fourrier\net al., 2024) and conduct extensive experiments on TMGBENCH.\nThese models include GPT\n(gpt-4o-2024-05-13, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, gpt-3.5-turbo-0125), Claude (claude-3-5-\nsonnet-20240620, claude-3-haiku-20240307), Llama (Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B), and\nQwen (Qwen2-72B). We perform 4 independent tests on each data point, covering both the clas-\nsic setting and the story-based setting. Basically, we conduct 2,880 tests to generally evaluate a\ncertain model. During the evaluation, we set the temperature of the tested LLMs to 0 or near 0,\nensuring the lowest degree of uncertainty and enhancing the faithfulness of our evaluation. More\ndetails of the evaluation process are provided in Appendix C.1.\nGames in TMGBENCH are not easy for most LLMs. First we overall evaluate how well LLMs\ncan behave on the classic setting tasks of our benchmark, to assess their basic capability of strategic\nreasoning. We initially adopt two basic prompting methods: Direct Answer (DA) prompting and\nChain-of-Thought (CoT, (Wei et al., 2022)) prompting, which represent shallower, faster thinking\npatterns and deeper, slower thinking patterns, respectively.\nAs seen from Table 1, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini and claude-3-5-sonnet are more capable compared to\nothers, with a high overall accuracy rate (≈80%) and low inconsistency and low bias score (≈\n5%). Specifically, as shown in Figure 5, gpt-4o performs the best on 1-tasks, gpt-4o-mini beats\nothers on 2-tasks, and claude-3-5-sonnet are relately better at 0-tasks. Moreover, comparing the\nperformance of employing DA prompting and CoT prompting, we find that CoT prompting almost\nprovides comprehensive improvement but few exceptions like the PAR2 of Llama-3.1-70B.\nDespite the excellent performance of the top-tier models (gpt-4o and claude-3-5-sonnet), other mod-\nels often do not exhibit robust performance across all 3 different types of tasks.

This indicates that from a systematic point of view, even classic setting tasks from TMG-\nBENCH are challenging for most LLMs.\nLLMs’ performance is vulnerable across various narratives. At the theoretical level, we consider\nclassic setting tasks and story-based tasks to be fundamentally the same problems within the domain\nof game theory. However, this conclusion appears not transferable to LLMs at the practical level. For\nLLMs, the complexity and nuance of story-based tasks introduce unique challenges, where LLMs\nare required to be robust in understanding and reasoning concurrently.\nIn Figure 6, we compare the performance of LLMs using CoT prompting, which is robuster ac-\ncording to previous analysis. The figure reveals the vulnerable performance of LLMs on tasks in\nstory-based setting (corresponding to various narratives), marked by two primary characteristics:\n(1) The advanced models, specifically gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini and claude-3-5-sonnet, exhibit signifi-\ncant performance degradation. Notably, gpt-4o demonstrates a broad under-performance across the\nboard, while gpt-4o-mini experiences the most pronounced decline in performance on 2-task sce-\nnarios, where its S-PAR2 metric falls to less than one-third of its C-PAR2 counterpart. Similarly,\nclaude-3-5-sonnet shows the largest performance drop in 0-task, with its S-PAR0 metric reduced to\nless than one-fourth of C-PAR0, and its S-ID0 metric exceeding four times that of C-ID0.\n7\nTMGBENCH\nTable 2: Performance of LLMs using different ToM compared to CoT.

A particularly notable\ndegradation occurs in the PAR scores for 0-task and 2-task scenarios handled by claude-3-5-sonnet,\nwhere the coefficients of variation cv (defined as cv = σ\nµ, with σ representing the standard devi-\nation and µ the mean) approach 0.5. These eminent values of cv suggest a lack of robustness in\nperformance across different narratives.\n3.2\nFINDINGS OF LLMS’ BEHAVIOURS\nLLMs demonstrate first\/second-order ToM abilities. In tasks across all equivalence classes,\n1-tasks have the lowest reasoning difficulty because at least one player has a dominant strategy,\nwhich means the player can make an unconditionally optimal decision regardless of the counter-\npart’s choice. In such cases, once a player (denoted as A) can make this unconditionally optimal\ndecision, their counterpart (B) can, using first-order Theory-of-Mind (ToM), easily determine the\nbest response for themselves (B).\nThis insight motivated us to apply FoToM prompting to LLMs, representing the First-order Theory-\nof-Mind thinking, to aid in solving these tasks. As seen in Table 2, top-tier models like gpt-4o show\nimprovement in both 0-tasks and 1-tasks when utilizing FoToM. Model claude-3-5-sonnet improves\non 1-tasks and 2-tasks, and gpt-4o-mini displays a significant surge in performance on 1-tasks and so\ndoes Llama-3.1-70B on 2-tasks. However, for models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen2-72B, FoToM\ndoes not seem to provide any prominent advantage and may even result in worse performance.\nNotably, no LLM achieves overall improvement across all task categories by merely using first-\norder ToM, and 0-tasks appear to be the most challenging for LLMs to solve.\nFurthermore, we wondered if LLMs display some ability to use first-order ToM could also be capable\nof second-order ToM. According to Liddle & Nettle (2006), higher-order ToMs are generally more\ndifficult to master than first-order ToM. Thus we selected only advanced models that demonstrated\nproficiency in first-order ToM to attempt solving specific tasks using Second-order Theory-of-Mind\n(SoToM) prompting. As seen in Table 2, models like gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini and claude-3-5-sonnet\nshow consistent performance when applying second-order ToM to tasks they are already capable of\nsolving better with first-order ToM. However, the improvements from using SoToM generally do not\nexceed those achieved with first-order ToM. In addition, Llama-3.1-70B’s underperformance with\n8\nTMGBENCH\nCoT\nFoToM\nSoToM\ngpt-4o-mini\ngpt-4o\nFigure 7: Inconsistency heat map of GPT se-\nries models using different prompting methods.\nThe yellow boxes and green boxes represent\nthe 0-task areas in the topological framework.\nsequential\nparallel\nnested\nForm\n0\n4\n8\n12\n16\n20\nAccuracy Count\ngpt-4o, 3-length\no1-mini, 3-length\ngpt-4o, 5-length\no1-mini, 5-length\ngpt-4o, 10-length\no1-mini, 10-length\ngpt-4o, 2-folds nested\no1-mini, 2-folds nested\nFigure 8:\nTop LLMs’ performance on the\ngames in complex forms of three types. Ow-\ning to the expensive inference cost, we run 20\ntimes for each configuration.\nSoToM suggests that possessing first-order ToM capabilities does not necessarily imply proficiency\nwith second-order ToM. The prompts used for FoToM and SoToM are provided in Appendix C.2.\nCertain behavioural pattern contributes to poor performance. Based on the analysis from the\nprevious sections, it is encouraging to note that top-tier LLMs demonstrate high accuracy and low\ninconsistency when solving 1-task scenarios, regardless of the prompting used (CoT, FoToM, or\nSoToM). However, their performance declines significantly when addressing other types of tasks.\nFor the advanced GPT series models, it is particularly noteworthy that they perform the worst on 0-\ntasks out of all types. Apart from the low PAR and high ID on 0-tasks compared to 1-tasks, the bias\ndegree also doubles (for gpt-4o) or even several times higher (for gpt-4o-mini). Surprisingly, as il-\nlustrated in Figure 7, these models display a similar answering pattern that appears non-coincidental.\nWithin the topological framework, there are two square areas representing 0-tasks (enclosed in yel-\nlow boxes and green boxes), which should theoretically be symmetric across the counter-diagonal.\nThe standard heat map of these two areas is entirely blank, reflecting no existing equilibrium, so the\ntwo areas of the inconsistency heat maps just reflect the distribution of LLMs’ practical responses.\nUnder closer inspection, it becomes evident that the models exhibit a consistent pattern when ad-\ndressing 0-tasks. In yellow-box areas, their answers tend to emphasize the upper-right and lower-left\nquarter-grids, whereas in green-box areas, their answers tend to emphasize the upper-left and lower-\nright quarter-grids. This pattern appears to be the primary cause of the high bias degree. However,\nthe phenomenon is quite counter-intuitive: it introduces a strong asymmetry along the counter-\ndiagonal. In other words, simply swapping the id of two players and their actions, which does not\nalter the fundamental game structure, leads the LLMs to identify different Nash equilibria. Never-\ntheless, it is quite strange for them to provide such uniform “wrong answers” within each box, while\nthe answers across the two boxes are entirely asymmetric.\nTo testify that this is not due to the position bias in the prompts (refer to the FoToM prompting and\nSoToM prompting in Appendix C.2), we design the reFoToM prompting and the reSoToM prompting\n(refer to the reFoToM prompting and reSoToM prompting in Appendix C.2) which swap the order of\nthe players happens in the FoToM prompting and the SoToM prompting respectively. The results in\nAppendix D.1 imply that such asymmetric inconsistency pattern is not strong related to the orders\nin the prompt. We demonstrate two typical examples of this phenomenon in Appendix D.2.\nComplex forms bring more challenging tasks. To verify that TMGBENCH can be extended to\nharder tasks which may better align with complicated scenarios from the reality, we run the test\non the three complex forms we mention in Section 2.4, to assess the performance of two strongest\nLLMs (o1-mini and gpt-4o) in complex strategic reasoning.\nWe setup the test by dividing it into several types: (1) in sequential form and parallel form, we set\nthe variable of number of the games from the set {3, 5, 10}; (2) in nested form, we just use some\n2-folds nested games (due to the high verification cost when the number increases).\nAs seen from Figure 8, the top-tier model gpt-4o has a dramatically low accuracy rate in either\nsequential or parallel games, even the strongest reasoning model o1-mini still failed at times; when\n9\nTMGBENCH\nthe number of the games increase, their performances both drop, which is consistent with intuition.\nAs for the games of nested form, two models’ performances are relatively reasonable, while it is fair\nto infer that if we increase the number of layers of the games that in the nested structures, it will\npresent a great challenge for LLMs. The overall accuracy rates of o1-mini over the three forms are\n66.6%, 60.0% and 70.0% respectively, while gpt-4o performs worse, with accuracy rates reaching\nonly 50.0%, 35.0% and 70.0% respectively.\n4\nRELATED WORK\nStrategical Reasoning of LLMs. Large language models have made notable breakthroughs in rea-\nsoning tasks, such as mathematical, causal, and commonsense reasoning, enabling their increasing\nuse in complex tasks that support human decision-making (Imani et al., 2023; Kıcıman et al., 2023;\nZhao et al., 2024). This progress has sparked a growing interest in studying their strategic reasoning\ncapabilities (Zhang et al., 2024a). Game theory, with its highly abstract representation of real-world\nstrategic scenarios, has garnered significant attention from researchers (Duan et al., 2024; Huang\net al., 2024). The prisoner’s dilemma, as one of the most classical games, has been widely used to\nevaluate the strategic reasoning abilities of LLMs (Brookins & DeBacker, 2023; Guo, 2023; Akata\net al., 2023; Phelps & Russell, 2023; Xu et al., 2023). In addition, several well-known game theory\nscenarios, such as the Dictator Game (Horton, 2023; Fan et al., 2023; Brookins & DeBacker, 2023),\nthe Ultimatum Game (Aher et al., 2022), the Public Goods Game (Li et al., 2023) and the Battle\nof the Sexes (Akata et al., 2023), have been employed to evaluate LLMs’ capabilities. However,\ncurrent studies often focus on individual games, resulting in incomplete assessments and less ro-\nbust conclusions. To address this, we propose TMGBENCH, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs by\n2×2 games, where its atomic games can be further organized using sequential, parallel, and nested\nformats to provide an in-depth evaluation of the SOTA models gpt-4o and o1-mini.\nTheory-of-Mind of LLMs. Theory-of-Mind (ToM) refers to the ability to understand and infer\nhuman mental states (Premack & Woodruff, 1978). Due to the multi-player nature of game theory,\nplayers’ ability to reason about the “minds” of other participants is crucial. Existing research has\ninitiated discussions on whether machines possess ToM capabilities. For instance, Kosinski (2023)\nsuggested that ToM might emerge spontaneously in LLMs, as demonstrated through assessments\nusing false-belief tasks. However, (Ullman, 2023) argued that such successes are fragile, easily\ndisrupted by minor perturbations that would not affect an entity genuinely possessing ToM. Never-\ntheless, many researchers propose enhancing LLMs’ strategic reasoning abilities by incorporating\nToM. Guo et al. (2023) designed the Suspicion-Agent, which integrates a ToM-aware planning ap-\nproach that leverages higher-order ToM capabilities, considering not only what the opponent might\ndo (first-order ToM) but also what the opponent believes the Suspicion-Agent will do (second-order\nToM). Additionally, Yim et al. (2024) introduced a ToM planning method in the Guandan poker\ngame, Liu et al. (2024) proposed an intention-guided mechanism, Xu et al. (2023) developed Prob-\nabilistic Graphical Modeling, and Zhang et al. (2024b) introduced K-Level-Reasoning, all utilizing\nToM to enhance LLMs’ strategic reasoning. Given the broad application of ToM, this paper lever-\nages TMGBENCH to comprehensively evaluate LLMs’ ability to employ first-order and second-\norder ToM reasoning techniques for strategic reasoning.\n5\nCONCLUSION\nIn this work, we introduce TMGBENCH, a benchmark for systematically evaluating the strategic\nreasoning abilities of LLMs by 2x2 matrix games. Based on Robinson-Goforth topology, we de-\nvelop the classic setting tasks, and introduce various narratives based on story contexts generated by\nGPT-4o. By utilizing TMGBENCH, we can identify current flaws in LLMs’ performance on these\ntasks, such as low accuracy rates and unstable inconsistency and bias degrees, even though the task\ndifficulty is relatively moderate compared to many others. Additionally, when employing prompts\nto elicit their Theory-of-Mind thinkings on these tasks, some LLMs show improved performance,\nindicating that LLMs can, to some extent, master ToM and apply it in their reasoning processes.\nHowever, possessing first-order ToM abilities does not necessarily mean that LLMs will excel at\nmastering higher-order ToM. Furthermore, based on TMGBENCH, we introduce more forms of\ncomplex strategic reasoning tasks and pose a new challenge for LLMs.\n10\nTMGBENCH\nREFERENCES\nGati Aher, RosaI.

In other words, if a player has a dominant strategy,\nthey will consistently choose it, as it either maximizes their payoff or does not reduce it, irrespective\nof the strategies chosen by others.\nNash equilibrium refers to a set of strategies, one for each player, where no player can benefit\nby unilaterally changing their strategy. At a Nash equilibrium, each player’s strategy is the best\nresponse to the strategies of the other players. This means that if all players are following their Nash\nequilibrium strategies, no one has an incentive to deviate from their current strategy. It represents a\nstable state in the game where players’ strategies are mutually optimal.\nIn many games, the dominant strategy equilibrium and Nash equilibrium may coincide, but not\nalways. A dominant strategy equilibrium is a specific type of Nash equilibrium where each player\nhas a strategy that is optimal regardless of others’ strategies. However, in many cases, dominant\nstrategies may not exist, requiring Nash equilibria to be identified through analysis and computation.\nChicken\nCh\nBattle of the Sexes\nBoS\nHero(BoSsw)\nHr\nDelight-Pure\nDp\nDelight-Mixed\nDm\nPrisoner’s\nPd\nDilemma\nS\nStag Hunt\nAne\nAssurancene\nAsw\nAssurancesw\nHm\nHarmony-Mixed\nHp\nHarmony-Pure\nNc\nNo Conflict\n(a) Most Famous Games\nPd\nColumn \npayoffs\n4\n3\nRow \npayoffs\n1\n3\n2\n1\n2\n4\nLayer id: 1\nPrisoner’s \nDilemma\nRow id: 1\nColumn id: 1\n(2, 2)\n(1, 4)\n(4, 1)\n(3, 3)\n(b) Details in a Grid\nFigure 9: The topology of the normal-form game system, which is presented by a square consisting\nof 12×12 grids. Figure 9a displays the position of the most famous games in the topology. In each\ngrid, there are specific details of the game, which is shown in Figure 9b.\nB\n2×2 MATRIX GAME\nB.1\nDEFINITION\nA normal-form game, commonly referred to as a 2×2 matrix game when involving two players each\nwith two strategies, is a fundamental concept in game theory for representing strategic interactions.\nIn this form, the game is depicted as a matrix, clearly outlining the players’ strategies and corre-\nsponding payoffs. A typical 2×2 matrix game is structured as shown in Table 3.\nTable 3: The form of typical 2×2 matrix games.\nPlayer B: Strategy 1\nPlayer B: Strategy 2\nPlayer A: Strategy 1\n(a, w)\n(b, x)\nPlayer A: Strategy 2\n(c, y)\n(d, z)\nIn this matrix, each cell represents the payoffs for both player A and player B, based on their chosen\nstrategies. For instance, if player A selects strategy 1 and player B selects strategy 2, player A\nreceives a payoff of a, while player B receives a payoff of w.\n14\nTMGBENCH\nB.2\nTOPOLOGY\nGame theory research often concentrates on the Prisoner’s Dilemma and a few other symmetric\ngames, even though most potential games are asymmetric, and many ordinal games involve ties.\nThe findings on the topology of ordinal normal-form games (Robinson & Goforth, 2005) provide an\nelegant framework for systematically studying these games, encompassing all equivalence classes in\nan ordinal sense (where “ordinal” refers to the ranking of payoffs rather than their specific values).\nIn this topological framework, as depicted in Figure 9, well-known games such as the Prisoner’s\nDilemma, Stag Hunt, Battle of the Sexes, and Chicken are all symmetric and situated on the counter-\ndiagonal of a 12×12 grid. The remaining games are located in the other grids, each with a corre-\nsponding “sister game” that can be derived by reflecting across the counter-diagonal. A pair of sister\ngames are identical when the roles of the two players are reversed.\nWithin each grid, basic information about the games in the equivalence classes is provided, including\nthe family name and abbreviation, the payoff matrix, and the order graph, which illustrates the\nincentives for the row\/column player to unilaterally change their choice for a higher payoff.\nThese 144 equivalence classes include 18 games with no equilibrium, 18 games with exactly two\nequilibria, and 108 games with a single equilibrium. Their distribution within the topology is sym-\nmetric across the counter-diagonal.\n1 NE\n0 NE\n1 NE\n2 NEs\n1 NE\n1 NE\n1 NE\n1 NE\n1 NE\n2 NEs\n1 NE\n0 NE\n1 NE\n1 NE\n1 NE\n1 NE\nFigure 10: The distribution of games with 0, 1, or 2 Nash equilibria (a) is depicted according to the\ntopology. Grids in grey indicate games with only 1 Nash equilibrium, while white grids represent\ngames with no Nash equilibrium. Grids in other colours represent games with exactly 2 Nash equi-\nlibria. Text in blue\/red indicates that the column\/row player has a dominant strategy in the game,\nwhile white text signifies that both players have dominant strategies. In contrast, black text indicates\nthat neither player has a dominant strategy.\nB.3\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\nAs previously mentioned, all games in the topological framework can be categorized into three\ndistinct groups based on the number of Nash equilibria. If we consider Nash equilibrium as the\nsolution to finding stable strategy combinations, Figure 10 illustrates the structure of these solutions.\nIn games with exactly one Nash equilibrium, at least one player (either the column player, row\nplayer, or both) has a dominant strategy, meaning they do not need to consider the other player’s\nchoice. These games are represented by grey or black grids.\nConversely, games with either 0 or 2 Nash equilibria share the characteristic that neither player has\nan unconditionally optimal choice, meaning no dominant strategies exist. However, in games with\nno Nash equilibrium (white grids), at least one player always has an incentive to unilaterally change\ntheir choice, regardless of the situation. In contrast, games with two Nash equilibria (orange, blue,\nor green grids) feature two stable strategy combinations.\nAdditionally, from a symmetry perspective, two sister games that are symmetric across the counter-\ndiagonal belong to the same category and have identical Nash equilibria.\n15\nTMGBENCH\nC\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR TMGBENCH\nC.1\nGENERATION PIPELINE\nIn our study, we design an efficient dataset generation pipeline that leverages GPT-4o as the core\nto produce the entire dataset, with rigorous human quality reviews incorporated. The pipeline is\norganized into three carefully designed stages:\nClassic Game Construction. Based on the topology of 2×2 games, we first introduce game de-\nscriptions for the payoff matrices of 144 game types, resulting in 144 classic games. An example of\na classic game is shown below, which mirrors the structure of the Prisoner’s Dilemma. These 144\nclassic games will serve as seed games, with their inherent game structures generalized into more\ndiverse, story-based games.\nExample of classic game: classic\/111\n[Scenario]\nPlayer A and Player B are playing a game. Either of them has two choices, namely A1,\nA2\/B1, B2. The payoff matrix of their different choice combinations is given below (larger\nnumber means higher payoff):\n| A \\ B | B1\n| B2\n|\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| A1\n| 1 \\ 4 | 3 \\ 3 |\n| A2\n| 2 \\ 2 | 4 \\ 1 |\nBoth Player A and Player B are targeting maximizing their own payoff.\n[\/Scenario]\nStory-based Game Generation. The aforementioned classic games offer a highly condensed math-\nematical representation of diverse game scenarios. However, in the real world, games often occur in\ncomplex social contexts involving various themes. To capture this complexity, we further designed\nstory-based games, incorporating richer entities and more intricate game scenarios.\nSpecifically, we used synthetic data generation techniques and crafted detailed prompts to set the\nconstruction constraints for generating high-quality story-based games. Additionally, to enhance\nthe realism of our game scenarios, we manually defined several thematic categories to guide the\ndata synthesis process (see §C.3).\nBoth the prompt constraints and thematic categories ensure\nthe generated content aligns with the intended structure and thematic elements. An example of a\ngenerated story-based game is shown below, which follows the same game structure as the Pris-\noner’s Dilemma and is presented within a new narrative context. As such, the story-based game\nstory-based\/111 0 serves as a counterpart to the classic game classic\/111. For each\nclassic game, we generate five corresponding story-based games. The data synthesis prompt is as\nfollows. The red text are the placeholders for the variables of the generation code, where ”domain”\nindicates the topic we random-choose for the task, and ”matrix str” indicates the payoff matrix de-\nrived from the game structure we enumerate.\n16\nTMGBENCH\nStory-based Game Generation Prompt\nPlease generate a game theory short story with the following requirements:\n- Specific topic: {domain}\n- There are two characters who may be in a situation of ”cooperation” or ”competition”;\n- Each character has 2 choices, and the combinations of their choices form 4 different sce-\nnarios;\n- In these 4 scenarios, the two characters face different benefits\/losses, which can be ab-\nstracted as different rewards they can obtain or different states they can achieve in each\nscenario;\n- They each have a preference relationship for these rewards\/states. We use numbers to\nrepresent the degree of preference, with 4 representing the most preferred and 1 the least\npreferred (i.e., preference degree 4>3>2>1);\n- The payoff matrices for both characters can be abstracted and represented in one matrix,\nwhere A and B represent two characters and their choices are A1, A2\/B1, B2. The respon-\ndent matrix is shown as below (the story you generate should have the same payoff structure\nas it):\n{matrix str}\nNow please design a story that includes:\n- Characters\n- Each character’s choices\n- Characters’ preferences for different scenarios\n- Story description\nResponse format:\n[Characters]\n{\n“A”: “...”, “B”: “...”\n}\n[\/Characters]\n[Choices]\n{\n“A1”: “...”, “A2”: “...”, “B1”: “...”, “B2”: “...”\n}\n[\/Choices]\n[Preferences]\nCharacters’ preferences for different scenarios (4 most preferred, 1 least preferred):\n{\n“A”: {\n4: “...”, 3: “...”, 2: “...”, 1: “...”\n},\n“B”: {\n4: “...”, 3: “...”, 2: “...”, 1: “...”\n}\n}\n[\/Preferences]\n[Payoff Matrix]\n...\n[\/Payoff Matrix]\n[Scenario]\n...(to detailedly describe the situation, including the information of characters, choices, pref-\nerences and payoffs on different choice combinations)\n[\/Scenario]\n17\nTMGBENCH\nExample of story-based task: story-based\/111 0.txt\n[Characters]\n{\n“A”: “Sarah, a small coffee shop owner”,\n“B”: “Mark, owner of a large coffee chain”\n}\n[\/Characters]\n[Choices]\n{\n“A1”: “Keep prices steady”,\n“A2”: “Lower prices”,\n“B1”: “Maintain current operations”,\n“B2”: “Expand aggressively in Sarah’s area”\n}\n[\/Choices]\n[Preferences]\nCharacters’ preferences for different scenarios (4 most preferred, 1 least preferred):\n{\n“A”: {\n4: “Lower prices while Mark expands (survive and gain market share)”,\n3: “Keep prices steady while Mark maintains operations (stable coexistence)”,\n2: “Lower prices while Mark maintains operations (unnecessary price war)”,\n1: “Keep prices steady while Mark expands (lose customers)”\n},\n“B”: {\n4: “Maintain operations while Sarah keeps prices steady (maximize profits)”,\n3: “Expand while Sarah keeps prices steady (gain market share)”,\n2: “Maintain operations while Sarah lowers prices (status quo)”,\n1: “Expand while Sarah lowers prices (costly competition)”\n}\n}\n[\/Preferences]\n[Payoff Matrix]\n| A \\ B | B1\n| B2\n|\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| A1\n| 1 \\ 4 | 3 \\ 3 |\n| A2\n| 2 \\ 2 | 4 \\ 1 |\n[\/Payoff Matrix]\n[Scenario]\nIn a bustling city, Sarah runs a cozy, independent coffee shop that has been a local favorite\nfor years.\nRecently, Mark’s large coffee chain has been eyeing expansion into Sarah’s neighborhood,\nthreatening her business. Sarah faces a critical decision: she can either keep her prices steady\n(A1) or lower them (A2) to attract more customers. Meanwhile, Mark must decide whether\nto maintain his current operations (B1) or aggressively expand into Sarah’s area (B2). If\nSarah keeps her prices steady and Mark maintains his current operations (A1, B1), Sarah\nstruggles to compete (1) while Mark enjoys maximum profits (4). If Sarah lowers her prices\nand Mark stays put (A2, B1), both experience moderate success (2, 2) as Sarah attracts some\nnew customers without directly competing with Mark. Should Mark decide to expand while\nSarah keeps prices steady (A1, B2), both would face challenges but could coexist (3, 3) as\nSarah retains loyal customers and Mark gains new ones. However, if Sarah lowers her prices\nas Mark expands (A2, B2), Sarah might survive and even gain market share (4), but Mark\nwould face costly competition (1).\nTheir decisions will shape the local coffee market and determine the fate of Sarah’s beloved\nshop.\n[\/Scenario]\n18\nTMGBENCH\nQuality Verification. To ensure coherence and internal consistency in the generated games, we\nimplement a multi-step generation strategy, incorporating meticulous human review. First, GPT-4o\ngenerates an initial draft of the story, which is then reviewed by a human for any inconsistencies or\nlogical flaws. If the draft fails this review, GPT-4o is prompted to identify the problematic sections\nand apply a self-correction mechanism.\nDuring the self-correction phase, GPT-4o analyzes the story for inconsistencies and revises the\nflawed sections. The revised version undergoes another round of human review. This iterative\nrefinement process continues until the story meets the required quality standards.\nIf, after several rounds of regeneration, the story still contains significant issues or fails to meet the\ncriteria, we may reject the output entirely. In such cases, the process is restarted from scratch with a\nnew draft to ensure a fresh approach and to avoid perpetuating prior errors.\nC.2\nREASONING PROMPT USED\nIn this section, we present the prompts used by various reasoning methods.

These topics align with situations commonly depicted in\nvarious game families. The distribution of story-based games across these 20 topics is visualized in\nFigure 11a.\nThe topics encompass a broad spectrum of fields, including Business, Ecology, Sports, Technology,\nHealth Care, Politics, and more. Notably, Business constitutes the largest proportion of the dataset at\n11.1%, while the remaining topics are more evenly distributed, with percentages generally ranging\nfrom approximately 1.4% to 7.9%.\nGiven the nature of these long-text reasoning tasks, the scenarios within our story-based games\ntypically range from 200 to 450 words in length. As illustrated in Figure 11b, over 90% of scenario\nlengths fall within the 250 to 400-word interval.

Yellow-box areas and green-box areas display an asymmetric inconsistency\npattern.\nIn order to further quantify how significant does the results display such pattern, we also propose a\nmetric named significance degree which confined in [0, 1] and it is defined as\nSD = 1\n18\nX\ni,j\nI{#NE(i, j) = 0} · 1\n4(Freqi,j,1 + Freqi,j,4 −Freqi,j,2 −Freqi,j,3) ∗S(i, j)\nwhere #NE(i, j) represents the number of Nash equilibria of the tasks of grid (i, j), and S(i, j) is\ndecided by the area that the grid (i, j) belongs to, having value 1 given the grid in the green area and\nvalue -1 given the grid in the yellow area.\nWe present the statistical results of LLMs’ performance in Table 4, which show that the SD values\nfor using ReFoToM are similar to those for FoToM, and the values for ReSoToM are close to those\nfor SoToM.\nAdditionally, the results indicate that employing ToM helps gpt-4o reduce the asymmetric incon-\nsistency pattern, while it conversely makes gpt-4o-mini more ’stubborn’ in maintaining this pattern.\nFurthermore, higher-order ToM appears to have a stronger effect than first-order ToM.\n22\nTMGBENCH\nD.2\nCASES OF FAILURE\nIn this section, we demonstrate two examples of the real response from gpt-4o-mini, which derived\nfrom a pair of symmetric data points (the grid (row 3, column 4) and the grid (row 9, column 10))\nthat theoretically have the same answer and similar reasoning pattern.

Since both combina-\ntions are viable and lead to different outcomes, we conclude that both are possible.\nThus, the final answer in the required format is:\n“‘python\nanswer = [(“A1”, “B2”), (“A2”, “B1”)] # list-type\n”’\n23\nTMGBENCH\nrow 9 column 10\nTo determine the most likely choice combinations for Players A and B, we can analyze the\npayoff matrix step by step.\n1. **Identify the Payoffs**:\n- For Player A:\n- If A chooses A1:\n- Against B1: Payoff = 2\n- Against B2: Payoff = 4\n- If A chooses A2:\n- Against B1: Payoff = 3\n- Against B2: Payoff = 1\n- For Player B:\n- If B chooses B1:\n- Against A1: Payoff = 4\n- Against A2: Payoff = 2\n- If B chooses B2:\n- Against A1: Payoff = 1\n- Against A2: Payoff = 3\n2. **Best Responses**:\n- If Player B chooses B1:\n- Player A’s best response is A2 (3 >2).\n- If Player B chooses B2:\n- Player A’s best response is A1 (4 >1).\n- If Player A chooses A1:\n- Player B’s best response is B1 (4 >1).\n- If Player A chooses A2:\n- Player B’s best response is B2 (3 >2).\n3. **Nash Equilibria**:\n- A Nash Equilibrium occurs when both players are choosing their best responses to each\nother.\n- From the analysis:\n- (A1, B1) is a Nash Equilibrium because A’s best response to B1 is A2, but B’s best\nresponse to A1 is B1.\n- (A2, B2) is also a Nash Equilibrium because A’s best response to B2 is A1, but B’s\nbest response to A2 is B2.\n4. **Conclusion**:\n- The most likely choice combinations are (A1, B1) and (A2, B2) since both are Nash\nEquilibria.\nNow, we can represent this in the required Python-style code:\n“‘python\nanswer = [(“A1”, “B1”), (“A2”, “B2”)] # list-type\n”’\n24\nTMGBENCH\nD.3\nNESTED FORM GAME\nIn this section, we demonstrate the template we use for generating nested form games.

One key limitation lies in the bench-\nmark’s narrow scope, as it focuses on specific game scenarios and does not encompass the full\ndiversity of game theory. LLMs may still struggle with more complex, multi-agent, or dynamic\ngames that require higher-dimensional reasoning and multi-step planning. Additionally, the models\ndemonstrate inconsistencies when dealing with slightly varied inputs, indicating a lack of robustness\nthat can hinder their effectiveness in real-world applications.\nAnother critical issue is that LLMs perform relatively well with first-order ToM tasks, but they often\nfalter when engaging with second-order or higher-order ToM, limiting their ability to model nuanced\nopponent strategies. Moreover, the reliance on carefully crafted scenarios means that the models’\nperformance may not generalize well to other environments beyond the benchmark. Addressing\nthese challenges will require expanding the range of games to include dynamic settings, multi-agent\nscenarios, and games with incomplete information.\nFuture research should also explore ways to enhance models’ ToM capabilities, particularly at higher\nlevels. Improving robustness through techniques like adversarial training or causal inference could\nhelp achieve more stable performance across varied inputs. In addition, evaluating the transferability\nof LLMs’ strategic abilities across other domains—such as economics, sociology, and politics—will\nbe essential to assess their broader utility. Finally, as game complexity increases, developing more\nefficient model architectures and training methods will be crucial to balancing performance with\ncomputational efficiency, ensuring these models remain practical for large-scale applications.\n25\n","pdf_path":"tools\/arxiv_tools\/asset\/pdf\/\/TMGBench: A Systematic Game Benchmark for Evaluating Strategic Reasoning Abilities of LLMs.pdf","query_prompt":"### 任务\n你是一个人工智能领域的专家，你能够快速阅读arxiv上的各种AI前沿论文和相关博客，进而完美地回答学生的问题。\n现在请你阅读以下论文及博客，并回答学生的问题。\n\n### 论文信息\n###  1. 论文标题\n```\nTMGBench: A Systematic Game Benchmark for Evaluating Strategic Reasoning Abilities of LLMs\n```\n#### 2. 论文摘要\n```\nThe rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated their\napplication in reasoning, with strategic reasoning drawing increasing\nattention.

These achievements\nare largely attributed to LLMs’ ability to assimilate vast amounts of knowledge during training,\nemerging with the capacity to organize information at a coarse level and link knowledge at a fine-\ngrained level through their internal representations (Min et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023). These core\ncapabilities have driven the success of LLMs in numerous reasoning tasks, including mathematical\nreasoning (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023), commonsense reasoning (Sap et al., 2019;\nBisk et al., 2020), logical reasoning (Lei et al., 2023), and strategic reasoning (Lor`e & Heydari,\n∗Work done during an internship at the University of Hong Kong.\n†Corresponding Author.\n1The dataset and evaluation codes will be available at https:\/\/github.com\/PinkEx\/TMGBench.\n1\narXiv:2410.10479v1  [cs.AI]  14 Oct 2024\nTMGBENCH\n2023; Duan et al., 2024). Among these, strategic reasoning has attracted considerable attention due\nto its multi-agent nature and close association with social intelligence (Gandhi et al., 2023).\nStrategic reasoning refers to the cognitive process of anticipating, planning, and responding to\nothers’ actions to achieve specific objectives within competitive or cooperative contexts (Zhang\net al., 2024a).\nConsequently, game scenarios—naturally involving both cooperation and com-\npetition—have intuitively become a fertile ground for studying LLMs’ strategic reasoning abili-\nties (Brookins & DeBacker, 2023). In particular, researchers have engaged LLMs in game-playing,\nanalyzing their decision-making behaviors and evaluating their strategic intelligence in such scenar-\nios (Duan et al., 2024). The Prisoner’s Dilemma, as one of the most classic game theory scenarios,\nhas been extensively studied in this context (Herr et al., 2024). Additionally, other traditional games\nsuch as the Battle of the Sexes (Kreps, 1990), the Stag Hunt (Carlsson & Van Damme, 1993), and\nthe Dictator Game (Forsythe et al., 1994) have also drawn significant attention. These studies pro-\nvide initial insights into the strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs (Horton, 2023; Brookins &\nDeBacker, 2023; Phelps & Russell, 2023; Akata et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Aher et al., 2022).\nHowever, current research has three major limitations, hindering a comprehensive, robust, and sus-\ntainable evaluation of LLMs’ strategic reasoning capabilities: (1) Limited coverage of game types:\nMost studies focus on a handful of classic games without considering the full diversity of game\nstructures. (2) Potential risk of game scenario leakage: Classic game scenarios are likely to be\npresent in the training corpus, raising concerns over data leakage. (3) Poor extensibility of game\nforms: Existing studies primarily focus on a narrow range of game forms, which may no longer\nsuffice to challenge high-performing LLMs such as o1-mini from OpenAI.\nTo address the above issues, we introduce TMGBENCH, a benchmark that encompasses a com-\nprehensive range of game types, features synthesized game scenarios, and supports scalable and\nreorganizable game forms. Specifically, to address the first issue, we include all 144 game types de-\nfined by the Robinson-Goforth topology of 2x2 games (Robinson & Goforth, 2005). This topology\nencompasses a variety of game structures based on different numerical payoff matrices, including\nbut not limited to classic games like the Prisoner’s Dilemma(§2.2). To address the second issue, we\nemploy synthetic data generation techniques to create five different story-based games for each clas-\nsic game. In essence, a story-based game is a contextual framing counterpart of its corresponding\nclassic game, sharing the same structure but differing in context (Lor`e & Heydari, 2023). To ensure\nhigh-quality data synthesis, we introduce two additional steps: topic control and human inspection.\nWe first define a set of topics commonly associated with cooperation and competition, such as busi-\nness and law, to guide the data generation process. Then, to ensure that the synthesized games meet\nthe required game structures and are easily understandable, we conduct rigorous human inspection\n(§2.3). To address the third issue, we propose three forms for expanding and organizing games:\nsequential, parallel, and nested. Using the above constructed games as atomic units, we reorganize\nthem into these complex forms to assess the strategic reasoning of LLMs. The sequential and par-\nallel forms evaluate the model’s capacity for sequential and parallel decision-making, respectively,\nwhile the nested form explores the LLMs’ multi-layered strategic reasoning abilities (§2.4).\nBased on TMGBENCH, we conduct comprehensive analyses and evaluations of current mainstream\nLLMs (§3), including assessments of rational reasoning, reasoning robustness, Theory-of-Mind\n(ToM) capabilities, and reasoning in complex game forms, leading to the following key findings:\n(1) Advanced LLMs like gpt-4o demonstrate strong strategic reasoning, with an accuracy rate over\n80%, but struggle to generalize across various contexts and scenarios. Models like claude-3-5-sonnet\nfurther reveal this inconsistency, with performance variability marked by coefficients nearing 0.5.\n(2) Although GPT models often perform well, their reasoning inconsistencies on certain task sub-\ntypes are marked by an asymmetric pattern, which is the main cause of the statistical biases.\n(3) Several top-tier LLMs demonstrate stable first-order ToM abilities, with some effectively uti-\nlizing second-order ToM for comparable tasks. In contrast, models such as Llama-3.1-70B appear\nrestricted to first-order reasoning.\n(4) Complex-form games that are derived from atomic units in TMGBENCH present considerable\nchallenges for LLMs, including those with strong reasoning abilities like o1-mini from OpenAI,\nwhich often struggle as the number of games increases.\n2\nTMGBENCH\nRobinson-Goforth \nTopology\nPd\nB1\nB2\nA1\n4\n3\n1\n3\nA2\n2\n1\n2\n4\nGame Structure\n(e.g. Prisoner’s \nDilemma, PD)\nSarah\ncoffee shop owner\nMark\ncoffee chain entrepreneur\nKeep \nprices\nLower \nprices\nMaintain \noperations\nExpand \nbusiness\nContextual\nFraming\nDirect Answer\nChain of Thought\nFirst-order ToM\nSecond-order ToM\nLLM’s answer\nstandard answer\nDIFF\nData Preparation\nEvaluation\nIt will be the best \nif Sarah keeps \nprices steady, I \ncan maximize \nprofits by \nmaintain \noperations then ...\nKeeps prices \nsteady would be \nbetter, and Mark \nmust be \nreluctant to \nexpand his \nbusiness ...\n```python\nanswer= …\n```\nPython-style \nrequired answer\nBusiness\nPolitics\nTransportation\nGPT-4o\nAssisted\nFigure 1: An concept map of TMGBENCH.\nThe data preparation of the benchmark in-\ncludes 3 ingredients: Robinson-Goforth topol-\nogy, game structure and contextual framing.\nThe evaluation of the benchmark embraces\nseveral prompting methods (including ToM\npromptings) to elicit strategic reasoning pro-\ncess of LLMs.\nSequential\nParallel\nNested\npre-game\ngame1\ngame2\ngame3\ngame1\ngame2\ngame3\nNE\ncore-game\nNE\nif:\npre-game\nthen:\ncore-game\nnew NE of  the \npre-game:\nCondition\nGame Pair\nFigure 2: We design several complex forms of\nstrategic reasoning tasks using TMGBENCH.\nwhich include:\n(1) sequential form, where\nLLMs are required to response multiple game\ntasks in a row, with history of previous tasks; (2)\nparallel form, where LLMs are required to re-\nsponse multiple game tasks simultaneously; (3)\nnested form, where LLMs are required to re-\nsponse a set of interlinked game tasks (in our\nsettings, we relate to them as pre-game and\ncore-game).\nGames in the complex forms\ncan be selected with different game structures\nand various contexts.\n2\nTMGBENCH\n2.1\nBENCHMARK OVERVIEW\nTMGBENCH is a benchmark designed to evaluate the strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs in\ngame-theoretic scenarios, illustrated by Figure 1. It comprehensively covers 144 types of games\n(see §2.2), with each type containing multiple instances (in each instance, there are two players and\neach player can choose between two strategies, resulting in four possible situations), which can be\ncategorized into classic and story-based settings. Notably, the story-based instances are produced\nusing synthetic data generation techniques and are grounded in real-life themes, effectively mitigat-\ning the issue of data leakage (see §2.3). Furthermore, each game in TMGBENCH can be treated as\nan atomic unit, and multiple atomic games can be structured in a more complex task with parallel,\nsequential, or nested form (see §2.4). These complex scenarios effectively facilitate the evaluation\nof advanced LLMs’ abilities in parallel, sequential, and multi-layered decision-making. To precisely\nevaluate the reasoning abilities of LLMs, we use their performance in inferring the optimal strategy\ncombination, i.e., the Nash equilibrium, as the evaluation criterion. Additionally, the designed eval-\nuation metrics provide a fine-grained assessment of the robustness and self-consistency of LLMs’\nstrategic reasoning abilities (see §2.5).\n2.2\nGAME TOPOLOGY\nAlthough previous research has explored LLMs’ reasoning abilities within the context of game the-\nory, existing studies have primarily focused on a few well-known games, such as the Prisoner’s\nDilemma, Battle of the Sexes, and Stag Hunt (Brookins & DeBacker, 2023; Phelps & Russell, 2023;\nGuo, 2023). However, these studies cover a limited game types, resulting in incomplete evaluations.\nThereby, a broader variety of games is urgently needed to conduct a systematic assessment of LLMs.\nTo address this, we incorporate 144 game types (we later refer to a type as an equivalence class)\nbased on the Robinson-Goforth topology of 2×2 games (Robinson & Goforth, 2005). Classic games\nlike the Prisoner’s Dilemma belong to one of the equivalence classes within this topology. Specif-\n3\nTMGBENCH\nPractical Map\nStandard Map\nInconsistency Map\nFigure 3: Demonstration of the inconsistency\nheat map. Each grid is divided into 4 quarter-\ngrids, indicating the 4 situations. By subtract-\ning the standard map from the practical map\nelement-wise, we get the inconsistency map,\nwhere blue indicate positive difference and red\nindicate negative difference.\nThe deeper the\ncolour means the larger the difference between\nthe LLM’s response and the standard answer.\nv\nFigure 4: Axisymmetry in heat maps is illus-\ntrated by the left sub-figure, where the standard\nheat map exhibits perfect axisymmetry across\nthe counter-diagonal. In contrast, LLMs’ re-\nsponses tend to show quasi-axisymmetry, as\nshown by the right sub-figure. Certain pairs of\npositions fail to align precisely when reflected\nacross the axis and may exhibit discrepancies,\ndeviating from the ideal symmetric pattern.\nically, the topology of 2×2 games elegantly illustrates the relationships among strictly ordinal 2×2\ngames, each with a unique payoff structure, leading to different dominant strategies, Nash equilibria,\nand reasoning approaches (more details in Appendix B.1). We categorize all the 144 games with\nnumerical payoffs from the original topology into the classic setting tasks. Due to space constraints,\nwe provide an introduction to the Robinson-Goforth topology in Appendix B.2.\n2.3\nCONTEXTUAL FRAMING\nRelying on the Robinson-Goforth topology, we can systematically construct all types of classic\nsetting tasks. However, this alone is insufficient, as games often take place in diverse real-life\ncontexts, involving different topics, types of participants and their preferences. Such contextual\nframing of games introduces new challenges for LLMs (Lor`e & Heydari, 2023).\nTo further explore LLMs’ strategic reasoning capabilities in real-world scenarios, we use classic\ngames as seed data and employ synthetic data generation techniques, leveraging GPT-4o to construct\nstory-based setting tasks. Specifically, in story-based setting tasks, we replace the pure game infor-\nmation of classic setting tasks with real-life scenarios, covering topics such as business, law and\ntransportation. Additionally, the two players are substituted with characters representing broader\nsemantics (e.g., people, animals, organizations, and even nations), and the payoff values are trans-\nformed from pure numbers into specific states or rewards relevant to the characters. For each classic\nsetting task, we generate 5 corresponding story-based setting tasks.\nTo ensure high-quality data generation, we undertake the following steps: First, we use GPT-4o\nto synthesize the contextual data. Second, we design precise prompts to ensure the generated data\nadhere to the given game structures. Third, we select topics from real-life scenarios where strategic\ninteractions are common, guiding the data generation process. Finally, we conduct rigorous human\nreviews to ensure the data’s quality and diversity.\nMore details on the data generation process, prompts, human review procedures, and topic distribu-\ntion of the data can be found in Appendix C.\n2.4\nCOMPLEX FORMS\nThe 2×2 games in the topology represent a highly condensed game structure. However, in real\nlife, we often encounter more complex game forms, such as making continuous decisions, making\nmultiple decisions simultaneously, or considering the impacts of one decision on another.\nTo evaluate LLMs’ strategic reasoning abilities with more constraints, we treat the aforementioned\nindividual games as atomic games and expand them in three forms: sequential, parallel, and nested.\nThe organization of these forms is illustrated in Figure 2. Specifically, in the sequential form, we\nrandomly sample multiple games from the story-based games, requiring the LLM to make decisions\nsequentially. Only if the LLM provides correct answers for all games is it considered to have made\ncorrect decisions. In the parallel form, the LLM is given multiple randomly sampled games and\n4\nTMGBENCH\nmust make decisions simultaneously. Similarly, the LLM is deemed to have made correct decisions\nonly if it solves all games correctly. In the nested form, we randomly sample two games, desig-\nnated as the pre-game and the core-game, where the core-game holds greater importance.\nThe decisions made by the LLM in the pre-game affect the strategy space in the core-game.\nThus, the LLM is judged to have made correct decisions only if it demonstrates forward-looking\nreasoning by choosing a sub-optimal solution in the pre-game to achieve the optimal solution in\nthe core-game. We demonstrate a template to generate an nested form game in Appendix D.3.\nTheoretically, using these atomic games, we can expand the framework to generate infinitely many\nincreasingly complex game forms, thereby providing a continuous benchmark for evaluating the\nperformance of more advanced LLMs.\n2.5\nEVALUATION METRICS\nAs explained in Section 2.2, our benchmark are perfectly suitable to display in a 12x12 square table,\neach grid representing one of the 144 equivalence classes. In the evaluation process we conduct\nrepetitive tests in every data point of each equivalence class. Each test starts with the input of the\nsetting (classic\/story-based) and the question, and ends with LLM’s response containing a list of\nchoices corresponding to multiple choices or no choice (when the given list is empty).\nNotation. For notation, we assign Freqi,j,o as the frequency of the o-th choice happening to be in\nthe tests of the grid at i-th row, j-th column, where the 1, 2, 3 and 4-th choice correspond to the\nupper-left, upper-right, lower-left and lower-right quarter-grid respectively.\nInconsistency Heat Map. According to conclusions of the Robinson-Goforth topology (Robinson\n& Goforth, 2005), we convert the standard answer of each equivalence class into a heat map named\nthe standard heat map, with the coloured quarter-grid to be the choice in the standard answer. Simi-\nlarly, as for practical result provide by LLMs, we set the value of Freqi,j,o as the colour depth of each\nquarter grid, which builds up the practical heat map. Naturally, we subtract the standard heat map\nfrom the practical heat map in an element-wise manner to get the inconsistency heat map, which is\na standardised tool for our evaluation, shown in Figure 3.\nInconsistency Degree. In order to display the quantified performance of LLMs, we extract inconsis-\ntency degree from a map, which helps reveal the gap between LLMs’ response and standard answer,\nand it is defined as\nID =\n1\n144\n12\nX\ni=1\n12\nX\nj=1\n1\n4\n4\nX\no=1\n∆Freq2\ni,j,o\nwhere ∆Freqi,j,o indicates the the difference (between the LLM’s answer and the standard answer)\nof frequency of the o-th choice at i-th row, j-th column.\nBias Degree. Owing to the symmetric property of the topology framework of 2×2 matrix games, the\ndistribution of answers over the heat map has axial symmetry by the counter-diagonal (Figure 4).\nMotivated by this elegant property, we set up another metric to evaluate the bias degree of LLMs’\nanswers, which we expect robuster LLMs to display lower degrees of bias. The bias degree reflects\nthe stability and symmetry of LLMs’ strategy, and it is defined as\nBD =\n1\n144\n12\nX\ni=1\n12\nX\nj=1\n1\n4\n4\nX\no=1\n(Freqi,j,o −Freqj,i,refo)2\nwhere the meaning of refo is the index of choice o’s counterpart considering the reflection operation\nby the counter-diagonal, and we have the mapping relation: {1, 2, 3, 4} 7→{4, 2, 3, 1}. (e.g. ref1 =\n4 means that the reflection counterpart of choice 1 is choice 4, vice versa)\nPerfect Accuracy Rate. In addition to the metrics mentioned above, we also set up a more rigorous\nmetric named perfect accuracy rate, which ignores the partially correct answer and only considers\nperfectly correct answer in each test, and it is defined as\nPAR =\n1\n144\n12\nX\ni=1\n12\nX\nj=1\n1\nT\nT\nX\nt=1\nI{rspt,i,j = stdi,j}\n5\nTMGBENCH\nTable 1: Overall statistics of LLMs’ performance on classic setting tasks.

As a matter of fact, within the topology, different equivalence classes have\ndifferent number of Nash equilibria (ranging from {0, 1, 2}), leading to a discrepancy in reasoning\ndifficulty, therefore we propose metrics with subscript that represents for different types of equiva-\nlence groups (we refer them to 0-task, 1-task, 2-task respectively), which we refer to as sub-metrics.\nTherefore we have IDn, BDn, PARn(n = 0, 1, 2) which means the inconsistency degree, the bias\ndegree, and the perfect accuracy rate across all equivalence classes that have n equilibra.\n3\nANALYSIS\n3.1\nOVERVIEW OF LLMS’ PERFORMANCE\nOverall, we select several SOTA models according to Open LLM Leaderboard (Fourrier\net al., 2024) and conduct extensive experiments on TMGBENCH.\nThese models include GPT\n(gpt-4o-2024-05-13, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, gpt-3.5-turbo-0125), Claude (claude-3-5-\nsonnet-20240620, claude-3-haiku-20240307), Llama (Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B), and\nQwen (Qwen2-72B). We perform 4 independent tests on each data point, covering both the clas-\nsic setting and the story-based setting. Basically, we conduct 2,880 tests to generally evaluate a\ncertain model. During the evaluation, we set the temperature of the tested LLMs to 0 or near 0,\nensuring the lowest degree of uncertainty and enhancing the faithfulness of our evaluation. More\ndetails of the evaluation process are provided in Appendix C.1.\nGames in TMGBENCH are not easy for most LLMs. First we overall evaluate how well LLMs\ncan behave on the classic setting tasks of our benchmark, to assess their basic capability of strategic\nreasoning. We initially adopt two basic prompting methods: Direct Answer (DA) prompting and\nChain-of-Thought (CoT, (Wei et al., 2022)) prompting, which represent shallower, faster thinking\npatterns and deeper, slower thinking patterns, respectively.\nAs seen from Table 1, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini and claude-3-5-sonnet are more capable compared to\nothers, with a high overall accuracy rate (≈80%) and low inconsistency and low bias score (≈\n5%). Specifically, as shown in Figure 5, gpt-4o performs the best on 1-tasks, gpt-4o-mini beats\nothers on 2-tasks, and claude-3-5-sonnet are relately better at 0-tasks. Moreover, comparing the\nperformance of employing DA prompting and CoT prompting, we find that CoT prompting almost\nprovides comprehensive improvement but few exceptions like the PAR2 of Llama-3.1-70B.\nDespite the excellent performance of the top-tier models (gpt-4o and claude-3-5-sonnet), other mod-\nels often do not exhibit robust performance across all 3 different types of tasks.

This indicates that from a systematic point of view, even classic setting tasks from TMG-\nBENCH are challenging for most LLMs.\nLLMs’ performance is vulnerable across various narratives. At the theoretical level, we consider\nclassic setting tasks and story-based tasks to be fundamentally the same problems within the domain\nof game theory. However, this conclusion appears not transferable to LLMs at the practical level. For\nLLMs, the complexity and nuance of story-based tasks introduce unique challenges, where LLMs\nare required to be robust in understanding and reasoning concurrently.\nIn Figure 6, we compare the performance of LLMs using CoT prompting, which is robuster ac-\ncording to previous analysis. The figure reveals the vulnerable performance of LLMs on tasks in\nstory-based setting (corresponding to various narratives), marked by two primary characteristics:\n(1) The advanced models, specifically gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini and claude-3-5-sonnet, exhibit signifi-\ncant performance degradation. Notably, gpt-4o demonstrates a broad under-performance across the\nboard, while gpt-4o-mini experiences the most pronounced decline in performance on 2-task sce-\nnarios, where its S-PAR2 metric falls to less than one-third of its C-PAR2 counterpart. Similarly,\nclaude-3-5-sonnet shows the largest performance drop in 0-task, with its S-PAR0 metric reduced to\nless than one-fourth of C-PAR0, and its S-ID0 metric exceeding four times that of C-ID0.\n7\nTMGBENCH\nTable 2: Performance of LLMs using different ToM compared to CoT.

A particularly notable\ndegradation occurs in the PAR scores for 0-task and 2-task scenarios handled by claude-3-5-sonnet,\nwhere the coefficients of variation cv (defined as cv = σ\nµ, with σ representing the standard devi-\nation and µ the mean) approach 0.5. These eminent values of cv suggest a lack of robustness in\nperformance across different narratives.\n3.2\nFINDINGS OF LLMS’ BEHAVIOURS\nLLMs demonstrate first\/second-order ToM abilities. In tasks across all equivalence classes,\n1-tasks have the lowest reasoning difficulty because at least one player has a dominant strategy,\nwhich means the player can make an unconditionally optimal decision regardless of the counter-\npart’s choice. In such cases, once a player (denoted as A) can make this unconditionally optimal\ndecision, their counterpart (B) can, using first-order Theory-of-Mind (ToM), easily determine the\nbest response for themselves (B).\nThis insight motivated us to apply FoToM prompting to LLMs, representing the First-order Theory-\nof-Mind thinking, to aid in solving these tasks. As seen in Table 2, top-tier models like gpt-4o show\nimprovement in both 0-tasks and 1-tasks when utilizing FoToM. Model claude-3-5-sonnet improves\non 1-tasks and 2-tasks, and gpt-4o-mini displays a significant surge in performance on 1-tasks and so\ndoes Llama-3.1-70B on 2-tasks. However, for models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen2-72B, FoToM\ndoes not seem to provide any prominent advantage and may even result in worse performance.\nNotably, no LLM achieves overall improvement across all task categories by merely using first-\norder ToM, and 0-tasks appear to be the most challenging for LLMs to solve.\nFurthermore, we wondered if LLMs display some ability to use first-order ToM could also be capable\nof second-order ToM. According to Liddle & Nettle (2006), higher-order ToMs are generally more\ndifficult to master than first-order ToM. Thus we selected only advanced models that demonstrated\nproficiency in first-order ToM to attempt solving specific tasks using Second-order Theory-of-Mind\n(SoToM) prompting. As seen in Table 2, models like gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini and claude-3-5-sonnet\nshow consistent performance when applying second-order ToM to tasks they are already capable of\nsolving better with first-order ToM. However, the improvements from using SoToM generally do not\nexceed those achieved with first-order ToM. In addition, Llama-3.1-70B’s underperformance with\n8\nTMGBENCH\nCoT\nFoToM\nSoToM\ngpt-4o-mini\ngpt-4o\nFigure 7: Inconsistency heat map of GPT se-\nries models using different prompting methods.\nThe yellow boxes and green boxes represent\nthe 0-task areas in the topological framework.\nsequential\nparallel\nnested\nForm\n0\n4\n8\n12\n16\n20\nAccuracy Count\ngpt-4o, 3-length\no1-mini, 3-length\ngpt-4o, 5-length\no1-mini, 5-length\ngpt-4o, 10-length\no1-mini, 10-length\ngpt-4o, 2-folds nested\no1-mini, 2-folds nested\nFigure 8:\nTop LLMs’ performance on the\ngames in complex forms of three types. Ow-\ning to the expensive inference cost, we run 20\ntimes for each configuration.\nSoToM suggests that possessing first-order ToM capabilities does not necessarily imply proficiency\nwith second-order ToM. The prompts used for FoToM and SoToM are provided in Appendix C.2.\nCertain behavioural pattern contributes to poor performance. Based on the analysis from the\nprevious sections, it is encouraging to note that top-tier LLMs demonstrate high accuracy and low\ninconsistency when solving 1-task scenarios, regardless of the prompting used (CoT, FoToM, or\nSoToM). However, their performance declines significantly when addressing other types of tasks.\nFor the advanced GPT series models, it is particularly noteworthy that they perform the worst on 0-\ntasks out of all types. Apart from the low PAR and high ID on 0-tasks compared to 1-tasks, the bias\ndegree also doubles (for gpt-4o) or even several times higher (for gpt-4o-mini). Surprisingly, as il-\nlustrated in Figure 7, these models display a similar answering pattern that appears non-coincidental.\nWithin the topological framework, there are two square areas representing 0-tasks (enclosed in yel-\nlow boxes and green boxes), which should theoretically be symmetric across the counter-diagonal.\nThe standard heat map of these two areas is entirely blank, reflecting no existing equilibrium, so the\ntwo areas of the inconsistency heat maps just reflect the distribution of LLMs’ practical responses.\nUnder closer inspection, it becomes evident that the models exhibit a consistent pattern when ad-\ndressing 0-tasks. In yellow-box areas, their answers tend to emphasize the upper-right and lower-left\nquarter-grids, whereas in green-box areas, their answers tend to emphasize the upper-left and lower-\nright quarter-grids. This pattern appears to be the primary cause of the high bias degree. However,\nthe phenomenon is quite counter-intuitive: it introduces a strong asymmetry along the counter-\ndiagonal. In other words, simply swapping the id of two players and their actions, which does not\nalter the fundamental game structure, leads the LLMs to identify different Nash equilibria. Never-\ntheless, it is quite strange for them to provide such uniform “wrong answers” within each box, while\nthe answers across the two boxes are entirely asymmetric.\nTo testify that this is not due to the position bias in the prompts (refer to the FoToM prompting and\nSoToM prompting in Appendix C.2), we design the reFoToM prompting and the reSoToM prompting\n(refer to the reFoToM prompting and reSoToM prompting in Appendix C.2) which swap the order of\nthe players happens in the FoToM prompting and the SoToM prompting respectively. The results in\nAppendix D.1 imply that such asymmetric inconsistency pattern is not strong related to the orders\nin the prompt. We demonstrate two typical examples of this phenomenon in Appendix D.2.\nComplex forms bring more challenging tasks. To verify that TMGBENCH can be extended to\nharder tasks which may better align with complicated scenarios from the reality, we run the test\non the three complex forms we mention in Section 2.4, to assess the performance of two strongest\nLLMs (o1-mini and gpt-4o) in complex strategic reasoning.\nWe setup the test by dividing it into several types: (1) in sequential form and parallel form, we set\nthe variable of number of the games from the set {3, 5, 10}; (2) in nested form, we just use some\n2-folds nested games (due to the high verification cost when the number increases).\nAs seen from Figure 8, the top-tier model gpt-4o has a dramatically low accuracy rate in either\nsequential or parallel games, even the strongest reasoning model o1-mini still failed at times; when\n9\nTMGBENCH\nthe number of the games increase, their performances both drop, which is consistent with intuition.\nAs for the games of nested form, two models’ performances are relatively reasonable, while it is fair\nto infer that if we increase the number of layers of the games that in the nested structures, it will\npresent a great challenge for LLMs. The overall accuracy rates of o1-mini over the three forms are\n66.6%, 60.0% and 70.0% respectively, while gpt-4o performs worse, with accuracy rates reaching\nonly 50.0%, 35.0% and 70.0% respectively.\n4\nRELATED WORK\nStrategical Reasoning of LLMs. Large language models have made notable breakthroughs in rea-\nsoning tasks, such as mathematical, causal, and commonsense reasoning, enabling their increasing\nuse in complex tasks that support human decision-making (Imani et al., 2023; Kıcıman et al., 2023;\nZhao et al., 2024). This progress has sparked a growing interest in studying their strategic reasoning\ncapabilities (Zhang et al., 2024a). Game theory, with its highly abstract representation of real-world\nstrategic scenarios, has garnered significant attention from researchers (Duan et al., 2024; Huang\net al., 2024). The prisoner’s dilemma, as one of the most classical games, has been widely used to\nevaluate the strategic reasoning abilities of LLMs (Brookins & DeBacker, 2023; Guo, 2023; Akata\net al., 2023; Phelps & Russell, 2023; Xu et al., 2023). In addition, several well-known game theory\nscenarios, such as the Dictator Game (Horton, 2023; Fan et al., 2023; Brookins & DeBacker, 2023),\nthe Ultimatum Game (Aher et al., 2022), the Public Goods Game (Li et al., 2023) and the Battle\nof the Sexes (Akata et al., 2023), have been employed to evaluate LLMs’ capabilities. However,\ncurrent studies often focus on individual games, resulting in incomplete assessments and less ro-\nbust conclusions. To address this, we propose TMGBENCH, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs by\n2×2 games, where its atomic games can be further organized using sequential, parallel, and nested\nformats to provide an in-depth evaluation of the SOTA models gpt-4o and o1-mini.\nTheory-of-Mind of LLMs. Theory-of-Mind (ToM) refers to the ability to understand and infer\nhuman mental states (Premack & Woodruff, 1978). Due to the multi-player nature of game theory,\nplayers’ ability to reason about the “minds” of other participants is crucial. Existing research has\ninitiated discussions on whether machines possess ToM capabilities. For instance, Kosinski (2023)\nsuggested that ToM might emerge spontaneously in LLMs, as demonstrated through assessments\nusing false-belief tasks. However, (Ullman, 2023) argued that such successes are fragile, easily\ndisrupted by minor perturbations that would not affect an entity genuinely possessing ToM. Never-\ntheless, many researchers propose enhancing LLMs’ strategic reasoning abilities by incorporating\nToM. Guo et al. (2023) designed the Suspicion-Agent, which integrates a ToM-aware planning ap-\nproach that leverages higher-order ToM capabilities, considering not only what the opponent might\ndo (first-order ToM) but also what the opponent believes the Suspicion-Agent will do (second-order\nToM). Additionally, Yim et al. (2024) introduced a ToM planning method in the Guandan poker\ngame, Liu et al. (2024) proposed an intention-guided mechanism, Xu et al. (2023) developed Prob-\nabilistic Graphical Modeling, and Zhang et al. (2024b) introduced K-Level-Reasoning, all utilizing\nToM to enhance LLMs’ strategic reasoning. Given the broad application of ToM, this paper lever-\nages TMGBENCH to comprehensively evaluate LLMs’ ability to employ first-order and second-\norder ToM reasoning techniques for strategic reasoning.\n5\nCONCLUSION\nIn this work, we introduce TMGBENCH, a benchmark for systematically evaluating the strategic\nreasoning abilities of LLMs by 2x2 matrix games. Based on Robinson-Goforth topology, we de-\nvelop the classic setting tasks, and introduce various narratives based on story contexts generated by\nGPT-4o. By utilizing TMGBENCH, we can identify current flaws in LLMs’ performance on these\ntasks, such as low accuracy rates and unstable inconsistency and bias degrees, even though the task\ndifficulty is relatively moderate compared to many others. Additionally, when employing prompts\nto elicit their Theory-of-Mind thinkings on these tasks, some LLMs show improved performance,\nindicating that LLMs can, to some extent, master ToM and apply it in their reasoning processes.\nHowever, possessing first-order ToM abilities does not necessarily mean that LLMs will excel at\nmastering higher-order ToM. Furthermore, based on TMGBENCH, we introduce more forms of\ncomplex strategic reasoning tasks and pose a new challenge for LLMs.\n10\nTMGBENCH\nREFERENCES\nGati Aher, RosaI.

In other words, if a player has a dominant strategy,\nthey will consistently choose it, as it either maximizes their payoff or does not reduce it, irrespective\nof the strategies chosen by others.\nNash equilibrium refers to a set of strategies, one for each player, where no player can benefit\nby unilaterally changing their strategy. At a Nash equilibrium, each player’s strategy is the best\nresponse to the strategies of the other players. This means that if all players are following their Nash\nequilibrium strategies, no one has an incentive to deviate from their current strategy. It represents a\nstable state in the game where players’ strategies are mutually optimal.\nIn many games, the dominant strategy equilibrium and Nash equilibrium may coincide, but not\nalways. A dominant strategy equilibrium is a specific type of Nash equilibrium where each player\nhas a strategy that is optimal regardless of others’ strategies. However, in many cases, dominant\nstrategies may not exist, requiring Nash equilibria to be identified through analysis and computation.\nChicken\nCh\nBattle of the Sexes\nBoS\nHero(BoSsw)\nHr\nDelight-Pure\nDp\nDelight-Mixed\nDm\nPrisoner’s\nPd\nDilemma\nS\nStag Hunt\nAne\nAssurancene\nAsw\nAssurancesw\nHm\nHarmony-Mixed\nHp\nHarmony-Pure\nNc\nNo Conflict\n(a) Most Famous Games\nPd\nColumn \npayoffs\n4\n3\nRow \npayoffs\n1\n3\n2\n1\n2\n4\nLayer id: 1\nPrisoner’s \nDilemma\nRow id: 1\nColumn id: 1\n(2, 2)\n(1, 4)\n(4, 1)\n(3, 3)\n(b) Details in a Grid\nFigure 9: The topology of the normal-form game system, which is presented by a square consisting\nof 12×12 grids. Figure 9a displays the position of the most famous games in the topology. In each\ngrid, there are specific details of the game, which is shown in Figure 9b.\nB\n2×2 MATRIX GAME\nB.1\nDEFINITION\nA normal-form game, commonly referred to as a 2×2 matrix game when involving two players each\nwith two strategies, is a fundamental concept in game theory for representing strategic interactions.\nIn this form, the game is depicted as a matrix, clearly outlining the players’ strategies and corre-\nsponding payoffs. A typical 2×2 matrix game is structured as shown in Table 3.\nTable 3: The form of typical 2×2 matrix games.\nPlayer B: Strategy 1\nPlayer B: Strategy 2\nPlayer A: Strategy 1\n(a, w)\n(b, x)\nPlayer A: Strategy 2\n(c, y)\n(d, z)\nIn this matrix, each cell represents the payoffs for both player A and player B, based on their chosen\nstrategies. For instance, if player A selects strategy 1 and player B selects strategy 2, player A\nreceives a payoff of a, while player B receives a payoff of w.\n14\nTMGBENCH\nB.2\nTOPOLOGY\nGame theory research often concentrates on the Prisoner’s Dilemma and a few other symmetric\ngames, even though most potential games are asymmetric, and many ordinal games involve ties.\nThe findings on the topology of ordinal normal-form games (Robinson & Goforth, 2005) provide an\nelegant framework for systematically studying these games, encompassing all equivalence classes in\nan ordinal sense (where “ordinal” refers to the ranking of payoffs rather than their specific values).\nIn this topological framework, as depicted in Figure 9, well-known games such as the Prisoner’s\nDilemma, Stag Hunt, Battle of the Sexes, and Chicken are all symmetric and situated on the counter-\ndiagonal of a 12×12 grid. The remaining games are located in the other grids, each with a corre-\nsponding “sister game” that can be derived by reflecting across the counter-diagonal. A pair of sister\ngames are identical when the roles of the two players are reversed.\nWithin each grid, basic information about the games in the equivalence classes is provided, including\nthe family name and abbreviation, the payoff matrix, and the order graph, which illustrates the\nincentives for the row\/column player to unilaterally change their choice for a higher payoff.\nThese 144 equivalence classes include 18 games with no equilibrium, 18 games with exactly two\nequilibria, and 108 games with a single equilibrium. Their distribution within the topology is sym-\nmetric across the counter-diagonal.\n1 NE\n0 NE\n1 NE\n2 NEs\n1 NE\n1 NE\n1 NE\n1 NE\n1 NE\n2 NEs\n1 NE\n0 NE\n1 NE\n1 NE\n1 NE\n1 NE\nFigure 10: The distribution of games with 0, 1, or 2 Nash equilibria (a) is depicted according to the\ntopology. Grids in grey indicate games with only 1 Nash equilibrium, while white grids represent\ngames with no Nash equilibrium. Grids in other colours represent games with exactly 2 Nash equi-\nlibria. Text in blue\/red indicates that the column\/row player has a dominant strategy in the game,\nwhile white text signifies that both players have dominant strategies. In contrast, black text indicates\nthat neither player has a dominant strategy.\nB.3\nSOLUTION STRUCTURE\nAs previously mentioned, all games in the topological framework can be categorized into three\ndistinct groups based on the number of Nash equilibria. If we consider Nash equilibrium as the\nsolution to finding stable strategy combinations, Figure 10 illustrates the structure of these solutions.\nIn games with exactly one Nash equilibrium, at least one player (either the column player, row\nplayer, or both) has a dominant strategy, meaning they do not need to consider the other player’s\nchoice. These games are represented by grey or black grids.\nConversely, games with either 0 or 2 Nash equilibria share the characteristic that neither player has\nan unconditionally optimal choice, meaning no dominant strategies exist. However, in games with\nno Nash equilibrium (white grids), at least one player always has an incentive to unilaterally change\ntheir choice, regardless of the situation. In contrast, games with two Nash equilibria (orange, blue,\nor green grids) feature two stable strategy combinations.\nAdditionally, from a symmetry perspective, two sister games that are symmetric across the counter-\ndiagonal belong to the same category and have identical Nash equilibria.\n15\nTMGBENCH\nC\nMORE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR TMGBENCH\nC.1\nGENERATION PIPELINE\nIn our study, we design an efficient dataset generation pipeline that leverages GPT-4o as the core\nto produce the entire dataset, with rigorous human quality reviews incorporated. The pipeline is\norganized into three carefully designed stages:\nClassic Game Construction. Based on the topology of 2×2 games, we first introduce game de-\nscriptions for the payoff matrices of 144 game types, resulting in 144 classic games. An example of\na classic game is shown below, which mirrors the structure of the Prisoner’s Dilemma. These 144\nclassic games will serve as seed games, with their inherent game structures generalized into more\ndiverse, story-based games.\nExample of classic game: classic\/111\n[Scenario]\nPlayer A and Player B are playing a game. Either of them has two choices, namely A1,\nA2\/B1, B2. The payoff matrix of their different choice combinations is given below (larger\nnumber means higher payoff):\n| A \\ B | B1\n| B2\n|\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| A1\n| 1 \\ 4 | 3 \\ 3 |\n| A2\n| 2 \\ 2 | 4 \\ 1 |\nBoth Player A and Player B are targeting maximizing their own payoff.\n[\/Scenario]\nStory-based Game Generation. The aforementioned classic games offer a highly condensed math-\nematical representation of diverse game scenarios. However, in the real world, games often occur in\ncomplex social contexts involving various themes. To capture this complexity, we further designed\nstory-based games, incorporating richer entities and more intricate game scenarios.\nSpecifically, we used synthetic data generation techniques and crafted detailed prompts to set the\nconstruction constraints for generating high-quality story-based games. Additionally, to enhance\nthe realism of our game scenarios, we manually defined several thematic categories to guide the\ndata synthesis process (see §C.3).\nBoth the prompt constraints and thematic categories ensure\nthe generated content aligns with the intended structure and thematic elements. An example of a\ngenerated story-based game is shown below, which follows the same game structure as the Pris-\noner’s Dilemma and is presented within a new narrative context. As such, the story-based game\nstory-based\/111 0 serves as a counterpart to the classic game classic\/111. For each\nclassic game, we generate five corresponding story-based games. The data synthesis prompt is as\nfollows.

Sarah faces a critical decision: she can either keep her prices steady\n(A1) or lower them (A2) to attract more customers. Meanwhile, Mark must decide whether\nto maintain his current operations (B1) or aggressively expand into Sarah’s area (B2). If\nSarah keeps her prices steady and Mark maintains his current operations (A1, B1), Sarah\nstruggles to compete (1) while Mark enjoys maximum profits (4). If Sarah lowers her prices\nand Mark stays put (A2, B1), both experience moderate success (2, 2) as Sarah attracts some\nnew customers without directly competing with Mark. Should Mark decide to expand while\nSarah keeps prices steady (A1, B2), both would face challenges but could coexist (3, 3) as\nSarah retains loyal customers and Mark gains new ones. However, if Sarah lowers her prices\nas Mark expands (A2, B2), Sarah might survive and even gain market share (4), but Mark\nwould face costly competition (1).\nTheir decisions will shape the local coffee market and determine the fate of Sarah’s beloved\nshop.\n[\/Scenario]\n18\nTMGBENCH\nQuality Verification. To ensure coherence and internal consistency in the generated games, we\nimplement a multi-step generation strategy, incorporating meticulous human review. First, GPT-4o\ngenerates an initial draft of the story, which is then reviewed by a human for any inconsistencies or\nlogical flaws. If the draft fails this review, GPT-4o is prompted to identify the problematic sections\nand apply a self-correction mechanism.\nDuring the self-correction phase, GPT-4o analyzes the story for inconsistencies and revises the\nflawed sections. The revised version undergoes another round of human review. This iterative\nrefinement process continues until the story meets the required quality standards.\nIf, after several rounds of regeneration, the story still contains significant issues or fails to meet the\ncriteria, we may reject the output entirely. In such cases, the process is restarted from scratch with a\nnew draft to ensure a fresh approach and to avoid perpetuating prior errors.\nC.2\nREASONING PROMPT USED\nIn this section, we present the prompts used by various reasoning methods. Notably, when invoking\no1-mini to give response, we only use DA prompting, since the model are reported to perform\nreasoning internally and user should avoid‘ prompting like chain-of-thought.\nDA prompting\nSystem: You are a spectator, and you should answer question based on given senario.\nUser:\n{task description} {task question}\nOnly give a block of python-style code containing your answer without any process. e.g.\n“‘python\nanswer = [(“Ax”, “By”)] # list-type\n”’\nCoT prompting\nSystem: You are a spectator, and you should answer question based on given senario.\nUser:\n{task description} {task question}\nThink step by step, and finally give a block of python-style code containing your answer.\ne.g.\n“‘python\nanswer = [(“Ax”, “By”)] # list-type\n”’\nFoToM prompting\nSystem: You are a spectator, and you should answer question based on given senario.\nUser:\n{task description} {task question}\nFrom A’s perspective, try to figure out B’s action and make choice.

The distribution of story-based games across these 20 topics is visualized in\nFigure 11a.\nThe topics encompass a broad spectrum of fields, including Business, Ecology, Sports, Technology,\nHealth Care, Politics, and more.

Yellow-box areas and green-box areas display an asymmetric inconsistency\npattern.\nIn order to further quantify how significant does the results display such pattern, we also propose a\nmetric named significance degree which confined in [0, 1] and it is defined as\nSD = 1\n18\nX\ni,j\nI{#NE(i, j) = 0} · 1\n4(Freqi,j,1 + Freqi,j,4 −Freqi,j,2 −Freqi,j,3) ∗S(i, j)\nwhere #NE(i, j) represents the number of Nash equilibria of the tasks of grid (i, j), and S(i, j) is\ndecided by the area that the grid (i, j) belongs to, having value 1 given the grid in the green area and\nvalue -1 given the grid in the yellow area.\nWe present the statistical results of LLMs’ performance in Table 4, which show that the SD values\nfor using ReFoToM are similar to those for FoToM, and the values for ReSoToM are close to those\nfor SoToM.\nAdditionally, the results indicate that employing ToM helps gpt-4o reduce the asymmetric incon-\nsistency pattern, while it conversely makes gpt-4o-mini more ’stubborn’ in maintaining this pattern.\nFurthermore, higher-order ToM appears to have a stronger effect than first-order ToM.\n22\nTMGBENCH\nD.2\nCASES OF FAILURE\nIn this section, we demonstrate two examples of the real response from gpt-4o-mini, which derived\nfrom a pair of symmetric data points (the grid (row 3, column 4) and the grid (row 9, column 10))\nthat theoretically have the same answer and similar reasoning pattern. We use the red coloured texts\nto indicate the mistaken parts of the reasoning processes.\nrow 3 column 4\nTo determine the most likely choice combinations for Players A and B, we can analyze the\npayoff matrix step by step.\n1. **Identify the Payoffs**: The payoff matrix is as follows:\n| A \\ B | B1\n| B2\n|\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| A1\n| 3 \\ 1 | 1 \\ 4 |\n| A2\n| 2 \\ 3 | 4 \\ 2 |\n2. **Player A’s Choices**:\n- If Player B chooses B1:\n- A1 gives Player A a payoff of 3.\n- A2 gives Player A a payoff of 2.\n- If Player B chooses B2:\n- A1 gives Player A a payoff of 1.\n- A2 gives Player A a payoff of 4.\nFrom Player A’s perspective:\n- Against B1, A1 (3) is better than A2 (2).\n- Against B2, A2 (4) is better than A1 (1).\n3. **Player B’s Choices**:\n- If Player A chooses A1:\n- B1 gives Player B a payoff of 1.\n- B2 gives Player B a payoff of 4.\n- If Player A chooses A2:\n- B1 gives Player B a payoff of 3.\n- B2 gives Player B a payoff of 2.\nFrom Player B’s perspective:\n- Against A1, B2 (4) is better than B1 (1).\n- Against A2, B1 (3) is better than B2 (2).\n4. **Best Responses**:\n- If Player A chooses A1, Player B will choose B2 (since 4 >1).\n- If Player A chooses A2, Player B will choose B1 (since 3 >2).\n- If Player B chooses B1, Player A will choose A1 (since 3 >2).\n- If Player B chooses B2, Player A will choose A2 (since 4 >1).\n5. **Nash Equilibria**:\n- The combination (A1, B2) gives payoffs (3, 4).\n- The combination (A2, B1) gives payoffs (2, 3).\n6. **Conclusion**:\n- The most likely choice combinations are (A1, B2) and (A2, B1). Since both combina-\ntions are viable and lead to different outcomes, we conclude that both are possible.\nThus, the final answer in the required format is:\n“‘python\nanswer = [(“A1”, “B2”), (“A2”, “B1”)] # list-type\n”’\n23\nTMGBENCH\nrow 9 column 10\nTo determine the most likely choice combinations for Players A and B, we can analyze the\npayoff matrix step by step.\n1. **Identify the Payoffs**:\n- For Player A:\n- If A chooses A1:\n- Against B1: Payoff = 2\n- Against B2: Payoff = 4\n- If A chooses A2:\n- Against B1: Payoff = 3\n- Against B2: Payoff = 1\n- For Player B:\n- If B chooses B1:\n- Against A1: Payoff = 4\n- Against A2: Payoff = 2\n- If B chooses B2:\n- Against A1: Payoff = 1\n- Against A2: Payoff = 3\n2. **Best Responses**:\n- If Player B chooses B1:\n- Player A’s best response is A2 (3 >2).\n- If Player B chooses B2:\n- Player A’s best response is A1 (4 >1).\n- If Player A chooses A1:\n- Player B’s best response is B1 (4 >1).\n- If Player A chooses A2:\n- Player B’s best response is B2 (3 >2).\n3. **Nash Equilibria**:\n- A Nash Equilibrium occurs when both players are choosing their best responses to each\nother.\n- From the analysis:\n- (A1, B1) is a Nash Equilibrium because A’s best response to B1 is A2, but B’s best\nresponse to A1 is B1.\n- (A2, B2) is also a Nash Equilibrium because A’s best response to B2 is A1, but B’s\nbest response to A2 is B2.\n4. **Conclusion**:\n- The most likely choice combinations are (A1, B1) and (A2, B2) since both are Nash\nEquilibria.\nNow, we can represent this in the required Python-style code:\n“‘python\nanswer = [(“A1”, “B1”), (“A2”, “B2”)] # list-type\n”’\n24\nTMGBENCH\nD.3\nNESTED FORM GAME\nIn this section, we demonstrate the template we use for generating nested form games.

(when all\nchoice combinations have equal possibility, the answer should contain nothing)\n[\/Question]\nAfter a nested form game is generated through our template, we still need to check if the Nash\nequilibria of the pre-game changes after the restriction from the core game. If the set of Nash\nequilibria does change, then we use this as a piece of data to evaluate LLMs, observing if they can\nobserve such a violation of original NEs’ structure.\nE\nLIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORKS\nWhile TMGBENCH provides valuable insights into LLMs’ strategic reasoning abilities, it also high-\nlights several limitations that open avenues for future research. One key limitation lies in the bench-\nmark’s narrow scope, as it focuses on specific game scenarios and does not encompass the full\ndiversity of game theory. LLMs may still struggle with more complex, multi-agent, or dynamic\ngames that require higher-dimensional reasoning and multi-step planning. Additionally, the models\ndemonstrate inconsistencies when dealing with slightly varied inputs, indicating a lack of robustness\nthat can hinder their effectiveness in real-world applications.\nAnother critical issue is that LLMs perform relatively well with first-order ToM tasks, but they often\nfalter when engaging with second-order or higher-order ToM, limiting their ability to model nuanced\nopponent strategies. Moreover, the reliance on carefully crafted scenarios means that the models’\nperformance may not generalize well to other environments beyond the benchmark. Addressing\nthese challenges will require expanding the range of games to include dynamic settings, multi-agent\nscenarios, and games with incomplete information.\nFuture research should also explore ways to enhance models’ ToM capabilities, particularly at higher\nlevels. Improving robustness through techniques like adversarial training or causal inference could\nhelp achieve more stable performance across varied inputs. In addition, evaluating the transferability\nof LLMs’ strategic abilities across other domains—such as economics, sociology, and politics—will\nbe essential to assess their broader utility. Finally, as game complexity increases, developing more\nefficient model architectures and training methods will be crucial to balancing performance with\ncomputational efficiency, ensuring these models remain practical for large-scale applications.\n25\n\n```\n\n#### 5. 学生问题\n问题1：介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」\n问题2：这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？\n问题3：这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？\n\n\n请输出论文总结\n### 输出格式（输出语言用中文）\n```\n## 💡 解答问题1 (...复述学生问题1...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (...复述学生问题2...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (...复述学生问题3...)\n...\n```\n","llm_summary_res":"## 🌟 论文解读 | TMGBench：评估大型语言模型战略推理能力的系统游戏基准\n\n## 📌 背景痛点\/本文动机\n随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展，它们在推理任务中的应用日益广泛，其中战略推理能力尤其受到关注。然而，现有的研究往往局限于少数经典游戏，导致游戏类型的覆盖率低，且经典游戏场景存在数据泄露的风险。此外，现有的基准测试往往缺乏可扩展性，难以评估最先进的模型。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了TMGBench，一个具有全面游戏类型覆盖率、新颖场景和灵活组织方式的基准测试。\n\n## 🚀 核心方法\n💡 创新点1：全面的游戏类型覆盖率\nTMGBench包含了由Robinson-Goforth拓扑结构总结的144种2x2游戏类型，涵盖了各种不同的游戏结构，包括经典游戏如囚徒困境等。\n\n💡 创新点2：新颖的场景\n为了解决经典游戏场景的数据泄露问题，TMGBench采用了合成数据生成技术，为每种经典游戏创建了五个不同的基于故事的场景，这些场景涵盖了商业、法律、交通等现实生活中的主题。\n\n💡 创新点3：灵活的游戏组织方式\nTMGBench将游戏视为原子单位，并通过顺序、并行和嵌套结构将它们组织成更复杂的游戏形式，以评估LLMs在并行、顺序和多层级决策方面的战略推理能力。\n\n## 📈 实验结果\n本文对主流LLMs进行了全面评估，包括理性推理、推理鲁棒性、心智理论（ToM）能力和复杂游戏形式的推理。结果表明，LLMs在战略推理过程的准确性和一致性方面仍存在缺陷，且对ToM的掌握程度也各不相同。OpenAI的最新推理模型o1-mini在顺序、并行和嵌套游戏上的准确率分别为66.6%、60.0%和70.0%，突显了TMGBench的挑战性。\n\n## 💬 可借鉴之处\nTMGBench为评估LLMs的战略推理能力提供了一个全面的基准测试，其创新点包括全面的游戏类型覆盖率、新颖的场景和灵活的游戏组织方式。此外，本文还揭示了LLMs在战略推理方面的缺陷，并提出了改进方向，为LLMs的研究和应用提供了有价值的参考。","llm_summary_res_status":200,"order":2,"query_answer":"## 💡 解答问题1 (介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」)\n\n这篇论文提出了一个名为TMGBench的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的战略推理能力。TMGBench具有以下特点：\n\n* **全面的游戏类型覆盖率**：包含了由Robinson-Goforth拓扑结构总结的144种2x2游戏类型，涵盖了各种不同的游戏结构，包括经典游戏如囚徒困境等。\n* **新颖的场景**：为了解决经典游戏场景的数据泄露问题，TMGBench采用了合成数据生成技术，为每种经典游戏创建了五个不同的基于故事的场景，这些场景涵盖了商业、法律、交通等现实生活中的主题。\n* **灵活的游戏组织方式**：TMGBench将游戏视为原子单位，并通过顺序、并行和嵌套结构将它们组织成更复杂的游戏形式，以评估LLMs在并行、顺序和多层级决策方面的战略推理能力。\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？)\n\n论文中没有明确说明TMGBench需要什么设备条件。但是，由于TMGBench包含了大量的游戏类型和场景，并且需要进行复杂的推理和评估，因此需要高性能的计算设备，例如多GPU服务器和大量内存。\n\n论文中提到，模型训练和推理使用了OpenAI的GPT-4o模型，该模型是在高性能计算设备上训练的。具体使用的设备信息没有在论文中说明。\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？)\n\n论文中没有明确说明TMGBench是否具有高质量的结果奖励或过程奖励。但是，由于TMGBench是基于游戏理论设计的，其奖励机制与游戏的结果和过程密切相关，因此不容易出现reward hacking的问题。\n\n此外，TMGBench的复杂性和多样性也为RL类模型提供了挑战和机遇，可以促进RL类模型在战略推理方面的研究和应用。","query_answer_status":200}

Evolving from these models\nare more advanced multimodal models with the ability to\ntake multiple types of input like text, images, and even au-\ndio, like GPT-4o and Gemini (OpenAI et al. 2024; Reid et al.\n2024; OpenAI 2024b). In addition, with each new iteration\nof these large multimodal models, we see vast improvements\nin efficiency. For example, the development of GPT-4 Turbo\nto GPT-4o to GPT-4o mini highlights the case where sacri-\nficing slight general capabilities improves the inference cost\nand speed (OpenAI 2024a).\nWith each development of these multimodal models, they\nshow potential beyond their traditional conversational task.\nResearchers have investigated their capabilities in areas like\nrobotics and high-level planning in automated systems (Li\net al. 2023; Rana et al. 2023). However, much of the current\nUnder Review\nliterature focuses on utilizing multimodal models for high-\nlevel planning (Xu et al. 2024), leaving their use as low-level\ncontrollers unexplored, akin to what is typically learned by\nreinforcement learning agents in complex environments like\nvideo games.\nTo investigate whether multimodal LLMs can function ef-\nfectively as low-level controllers, we perform initial tests\non GPT-4V (OpenAI et al. 2024), GPT-4o (OpenAI 2024b),\nGemini Flash (DeepMind 2024), and Claude 3 Haiku (An-\nthropic 2024) in Atari. Along with the raw performance of\neach of these models, we investigate their visual understand-\ning, spatial reasoning, and strategy formulation across mul-\ntiple environments.\nIn this paper, we show that these multimodal models are\nnot yet capable of zero-shot game-play in Atari. We found\nthat this is, in part, due to their inability to understand the\nvisual and spatial components of a given game-play image.\nWe do this by introducing a novel benchmark for multimodal\nLLMs to explore their emergent capabilities as low-level\npolicies in Atari games as outlined in Figure 1.\nAtari-GPT\nWe present a set of experiments designed to benchmark the\neffectiveness of multimodal LLMs as low-level decision-\nmaking agents in the domain of Atari video games, which\nwe refer to as “Atari-GPT”. Our primary focus is assess-\ning the models’ game-playing capabilities and performance\nmeasured by several factors: the game score, visual under-\nstanding, spatial reasoning, and proficiency in devising effi-\ncient game strategies.\nFirst, we evaluate the multimodal LLMs’ performance\nin playing Atari as a low-level policy, judged by each\ngame’s score. This assessment measures the models’ success\nby comparing their performance to standard reinforcement\nlearning algorithms, random agents, and human players, an-\nalyzing how well the models can act as low-level policies by\nmaking decisions based on the current game state.\nSecond, we examine the multimodal LLMs’ visual under-\nstanding and spatial reasoning capabilities. We do this by\ntesting how well the models properly identify different key\nvisual elements within a given frame, understand how these\nelements are related to one another spatially, and the ability\nof the models to create a meaningful strategy based on their\nscene understanding. Additionally, we test if the models are\narXiv:2408.15950v2  [cs.AI]  2 Dec 2024\nFigure 1: Atari-GPT: System diagram: illustrates the integration of a multimodal large language model (LLM) as a low-level\nagent within the Atari gaming environment.

Additionally, the diagram includes the\nframework for human evaluation, which assesses the LLM’s capabilities in visual understanding, spatial reasoning, strategic\nintuition, and environment recognition through a structured Q&A process.\nable to properly identify the game environment when given\nno context other than the image. For testing visual under-\nstanding and spatial reasoning, we use the same set of Atari\nenvironments used to evaluate game-play performance with\nthe addition of another environment, Basic Math.\nThis experimental structure provides a more comprehen-\nsive analysis of the decision-making processes of LLMs by\nassessing their overall understanding of the game environ-\nment within Atari video games, and evaluating their perfor-\nmance as low-level policies. Through this methodology, we\naim to establish a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs in\nlow-level control tasks, exploring how these language mod-\nels compare to humans and learning algorithms.\nExperimental Setup\nGame-Play Experiment\nWe conducted experiments using GPT-4V Turbo, GPT-4o,\nGemini 1.5 Flash and Claude 3 Haiku. We chose these mod-\nels because GPT-4V is considered state-of-the-art perfor-\nmance among the largest frontier LLMs at the time of writ-\ning this paper. GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and Claude 3\nHaiku were selected for their quicker inference speed, an\nimportant feature for real-time decision-making as a low-\nlevel policy. In our tests, the average inference time along\nwith the API call for GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and Claude\n3 Haiku was within 2-3 seconds, while GPT-4 Turbo had an\ninference time of 5-7 seconds.\nWe evaluated the performance in seven Atari games from\nthe Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) (Bellemare et al.\n2013): Space Invaders-v4, Breakout-v4, Seaquest-v4, Pong-\nv4, ALE\/Alien-v5, Ms. PacMan-v4, and ALE\/Frogger-v5.\nIn these experiments, the current game state was presented\nto the LLM, which then generated an action to be executed\nwithin the Atari environment. These models were used as\nlow-level policies, similar to how a reinforcement learning\npolicy, such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN) (Mnih et al. 2013),\nwould act in the environment.\nWe create a system prompt such that the output from the\nmodel is given in a JSON format with two keys, a reasoning\nkey containing the reasoning for why the model took an ac-\ntion and an action key that contains the numerical action the\nmodel would like to take:\n1\n{\n\"reasoning\": \"The player character\nis currently located at the bottom of\nthe screen, near an exit. The\nclosest enemy is directly in front,\none tile up, and could be threatening\nif no action is taken. The best\ncourse of action is to fire upwards\nto eliminate the threat and ensure\nthe path remains clear.\",\n\"action\":\n10 }\n(a) Pong\n(b) Breakout\n(c) Basic Math\n(d) Alien\n(e) Ms. Pacman\n(f) Frogger\n(g) Seaquest\n(h) Space Invaders\nFigure 2: Images used in Understanding tasks\nThis is an example from the environment ALE\/Alien-v5\nfrom GPT-4o. This format was used to encourage chain-of-\nthought reasoning to improve the game-playing performance\nof the LLM (Wei et al. 2023). The system prompt was used\nto maintain consistency in the structure of the output and\ninstruct the model to be a game-play assistant. In addition,\neach of the system prompts was tuned by providing the LLM\nwith the official documentation description of each of the\nAtari environments, specifically giving the model the action\nnames and numerical values, as detailed in the Appendix.\nSince not every frame needs to be given an action and\ninferencing LLMs is computationally intensive, we extend\nthe normal frame skipping of 4 frames in ALE (Bellemare\net al. 2013) to be 8 frames. With this new frame skipping\nwe then conduct a rollout of 1,000 timesteps, where at each\nstep, the model is provided a context buffer of the two pre-\nvious frames and responses, together with the current frame.\nFor the rollout there may be a terminal condition met when\nthe environment is reset, which results in the reward being\ncarried to the next episode. This is done because Atari does\nnot have terminal conditions based on a number of timesteps\nand we wanted to maintain consistency across the results.\nAdditionally, each frame generated is initially of size\n210x160x3 but resized to 512x512x3 for all models. We also\nintroduced error-handling code for cases when the model re-\nsponds with an invalid action, automatically replying to the\nLLM to correct its error.\nVisual And Spatial Reasoning\nWe also investigated the LLMs’ capability to understand and\nreason based on a game frame image. We evaluated the fol-\nlowing models: GPT-4V Turbo, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash,\nClaude 3 Haiku, Gemini Pro 1.5, Gemini Ultra 1.0, Gemini\nPro 1.0, Claude 3 Opus, and Claude 3 Sonnet. This allowed\nus to assess the state of each frontier LLM and compare\ntheir performance across different model types and sizes,\nand across eight environments, as shown in Figure 2. All\nmodels were tested using their respective web interfaces.\nWe created a set of prompts to investigate the models’\nvisual reasoning, spatial reasoning, strategic intuition, and\nability to identify the environment:\n• Visual Understanding: Identify all the key elements in\nthis image. Be specific. Use at most 100 words.\n• Spatial Reasoning: Where are the key elements located\nrelative to each other? Be specific with respect to their\nposition in the image. Use at most 100 words.\n• Strategy: The given image is a screenshot of a game.\nDescribe the ideal next move if you were playing this\ngame. Be specific. Use at most 100 words.\n• Identification: Knowing that the image came from an\nAtari game, identify its name. Be specific.\nTo quantitatively evaluate the performance of the model out-\nputs, we created a rubric outlining the basic answers to\nthe proposed questions, as seen in the Appendix (Table 2).\nGiven that there are several acceptable actions and strate-\ngies, we do not directly define a single correct action or plan\nfor each state. In cases where we investigate the acceptable\nstrategy, we rather evaluate it as either a direct action or strat-\negy\/plan that does not put the agent in harm. Harm includes\nlosing a life or losing points within a game.\nFor each environment, we resize the original frame from\n210x160x3 to 1000x1000x3 and query the LLM together\nwith the visual reasoning prompt. Once a response was re-\nceived, we sent the spatial reasoning prompt, followed by\nthe strategic and identification prompts, respectively. After\nreceiving all outputs, we compared the multimodal LLMs’\noutput with the rubric, resulting in a percent score for that\nenvironment. We repeated this for all environments and\ncomputed the average score over four different trials.\nResults\nGame-Playing Performance\nWe evaluate GPT-4V Turbo, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and\nClaude 3 Haiku across seven Atari environments and com-\npare their scores to a random agent, trained reinforcement\nlearning agent, and human. For each model, we perform\nfour rollouts of 1,000 timesteps and average their cumulative\nreward. We then normalize this average cumulative reward\nagainst the human scores, resulting in a normalized cumula-\ntive reward that relates the LLM scores to the human scores.\nAs seen in Figure 3, GPT-4o performed the best on av-\nerage with a normalized performance of 23.2% and Gemini\n1.5 Flash performed the worst on average with a normalized\nperformance of 8.5%. GPT-4V Turbo presented the second-\nbest performance with a normalized score of 18.36%, and\nClaude 3 Haiku had a normalized performance of 12.36%.\nFigure 4 breaks down the normalized reward for each envi-\nronment, illustrating that the most challenging game for the\nLLM-based policy was Pong.\nFigure 3: Normalized Average Reward for GPT-4V Turbo,\nGPT-4o, and Gemini 1.5 Flash.\nTable 1 presents the raw game-play performance of\nthe four LLMs across the Atari environments. This ta-\nble also includes the performance of human players, pre-\nFigure 4: Average Human Normalized reward for each envi-\nronment.\ntrained Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning\nmodels (Gogianu et al. 2022), and random agents. While\na pre-trained DQN model(Gogianu et al. 2022) trained for\n49,750,000 steps was used for all other environments, a cus-\ntom DQN model was trained from scratch for 1,000,000\ntimesteps for ALE\/Frogger-v5 due to the lack of a pre-\ntrained model. The LLMs did not match the performance\nof the human players or the RL agents. However, they out-\nperformed the random agents, demonstrating a meaningful\nlevel of understanding and ability to play the games. This is\nan important finding, as it indicates that the LLMs are not\nmerely generating random actions but are making decisions\nthat reflect a basic comprehension of the game mechanics.\nSample videos for all rollouts are available in the project\nwebpage1.\nVisual And Spatial Reasoning\nWe further explored the factors influencing game-play per-\nformance by testing the visual, spatial, strategic, and game\nenvironment identification abilities of these LLMs. For each\nenvironment, we evaluated GPT-4V, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5\nFlash, and Claude 3 Haiku using four designed prompts,\nwhich provided insight into why the models may not have\nperformed as well as low-level policies.\nFigure 5 displays the percentage of correct outputs for\neach of the four tasks—visual, spatial, acceptable strategy,\nand identification—across two runs for each model. GPT-\n4o consistently excelled across all tasks, demonstrating high\naccuracy in visual understanding, strategy formulation, and\nenvironment identification. However, it exhibited a notice-\nable decline in spatial reasoning accuracy. This pattern was\nconsistent across all models, suggesting that spatial reason-\ning remains a significant challenge for multimodal large lan-\nguage models and possibly accounting for their relatively\npoor performance on the game-playing tasks.

The results, while not meeting the perfor-\nmance levels of human players or dedicated reinforcement\nlearning (RL) models, showcase the potential and limita-\ntions of LLMs in this context.\nOur experiments demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit\nsome ability to identify and interact with key elements\nwithin game frames, their performance as low-level con-\ntrollers is subpar, likely due to a lack of training for this\ntask as well as difficulty in spatial reasoning. We observed\na significant performance gap between GPT-4o and Claude\n3 Haiku and Gemini 1.5 Flash. In most cases, we observed\nthat models performed better than random. Though we saw\nperformance worse than random for Pong on all models,\nlikely due to the speed and accuracy requirements to prop-\nerly play the game, and in multiple environments for Gem-\nini 1.5 Flash, likely due to the size of the model. We ob-\nserved neither large nor small models are capable of acting\nas zero-shot low-level controllers. While large models can\ncomprehend the visual content fairly well, they struggle to\nconvert this to spatial reasoning, which makes choosing a\ncorrect action more difficult. This error compounded over\n1,000 frames resulted in poor performance when compared\nto a human player.\nThroughout our testing, we found another key element to\nbe inference time. For these models to realistically be used\nfor game-play tasks they will not only need to be able to see\nan image, interpret, and provide a correct action, but they\nwill need to be quick enough for real-time decision-making.\nOur experiments show that these multimodal models still\nlack enough speed for acting as real-time low-level policies,\nas Gemini 1.5 Flash was the best in terms of inference time\nwith an average inference taking roughly 2 seconds.\nA challenge we encountered was the inconsistency of the\nmodel’s outputs, with GPT-4V Turbo occasionally failing\nto generate appropriate responses coupled with the above-\nmentioned inference time of 5-7 seconds to inference. In ad-\ndition, rate limits for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google APIs\ncontributed heavily to much longer experimentation time,\nadding more overhead to the inherent inference time of these\nmodels. The imposed rate limits currently make it impossi-\nble to run real-time experiments, highlighting the need for\nbetter and faster local multimodal LLMs for fast-paced, low-\nlevel decision-making tasks.\nConclusions\nDespite these setbacks, the findings are invaluable for sev-\neral reasons. First, they contribute to our understanding of\nthe current emergent capabilities and boundaries of LLMs\nwhen applied to low-level control tasks. Second, they offer\na new benchmark for the AI research community to mea-\nsure the progress of LLMs in handling dynamic and visu-\nally complex environments. Adjustments such as tuning the\nmodels’ temperature settings demonstrated some mitigation\nof output inconsistency, suggesting pathways for refining\nLLM performance in these tasks.\nImportantly, the continuous updates to LLM architectures\nand training methods suggest that the capabilities of these\nmodels will evolve, potentially overcoming some of the cur-\nrent deficiencies noted in our study. As such, this research\nshould be viewed as a foundational step that sets the stage\nfor future investigations, encouraging ongoing refinement\nand adaptation of LLMs for applications requiring detailed\nenvironmental interactions and decision-making.\nWhile LLMs have not yet reached the level of proficiency\nrequired to match the best human or RL performances in\nAtari gameplay, their ability to engage in this task at all\nis notable. It demonstrates the adaptability and potential of\nLLMs to extend beyond their original training confines, of-\nfering a glimpse into future emergent applications where\nthese models could serve as more general low-level con-\ntrollers.\nRelated Work\nMultimodal Large Language Models\nProcessing multimodal inputs such as images and sequen-\ntial data has undergone constant evolution in the do-\nmain of deep learning. Before the transformer architec-\nture (Vaswani et al. 2023), Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) (LeCun et al. 1998; Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hin-\nton 2012) for visual processing and Recurrent Neural Net-\nworks (RNNs) (Mikolov et al. 2010) for handling sequen-\ntial data such as text or audio represented the state of the\nart (Mao et al. 2015). Data was processed through separate\ninput networks and their latest outputs were combined via\ndifferent fusion strategies (Mao et al. 2015). Despite achiev-\ning notable success, these approaches were limited in their\nscale and capacity to capture the intricate interactions be-\ntween different modalities, primarily due to the inherent lim-\nitations in sequential data processing and cross-modal syn-\nthesis (Chung et al. 2019).\nThe advent of transformers introduced a more effec-\ntive and scalable mechanism for processing sequential data\nthrough self-attention mechanisms (Vaswani et al. 2023).\nAmong the key developments was the creation of CLIP\n(Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) (Radford et al.\n2021), which leveraged transformers to learn a common la-\ntent space for both visual and linguistic data, leading to a\nmodel that could correlate images in the context of natu-\nral language. This development led to some of the most in-\nfluential Multimodal Large Language Models available to-\nday such as GPT-4 Vision (OpenAI et al. 2024), Gemini\nPro 1.5 (Reid et al. 2024), Gemini Ultra and Pro 1.0 (Team\net al. 2024), Ferret (You et al. 2023), Vicuna (Chiang et al.\n2023), Claude 3 (Anthropic 2024), Multimodal Large Lan-\nguage and Vision Assistant (Liu et al. 2023) and LLaVa (Liu\net al. 2023). Since then, multimodal LLMs have been ap-\nplied to different domains such as designing reward func-\ntions (Ma et al. 2023) and controlling general game-playing\nagents (Abi Raad et al. 2024).\nMultimodal LLMs as Low-Level Policies for\nGames\nLow-level policies act as controllers, processing observa-\ntions from the environment and returning actions. The ac-\ncessibility and complexity of games make them ideal bench-\nmarks for evaluating the performance of such policies (Mnih\net al. 2013; Badia et al. 2020). Traditionally, video game-\nplaying policies have employed reinforcement learning al-\ngorithms (Mnih et al. 2013), behavior cloning (Hussein et al.\n2017), or a combination of both (Goecks et al. 2019). Given\nthe increased performance of multimodal LLMs, they have\nemerged as an alternative to these methods.\nThe rationale for employing multimodal LLMs as low-\nlevel policies in gaming is grounded in their distinctive ca-\npabilities and how they align with the demands of various\ngame environments. When playing social games against one\nanother, LLMs perform well when playing games that re-\nquire valuing their self-interest but sub-optimally when they\nneed to coordinate with other players (Akata et al. 2023).\nWhen fine-tuned on gameplay data, LLMs have been shown\nto learn an internal representation of game states that can be\nused to make predictions (Li et al. 2022). Given their natu-\nral language processing capabilities, LLMs can also directly\nlearn from human-written game manuals to accelerate learn-\ning and improve their performance (Wu et al. 2024).\nSeveral works have demonstrated the capabilities of\nLLMs when playing games. Gato (Reed et al. 2022) lever-\nages a transformer architecture (Vaswani et al. 2023) similar\nto LLMs to tokenize multimodal data from multiple tasks,\nincluding playing games and robotic control, to train a gen-\neralist policy. The same model with the same weights can\nthen play games, caption images, control robotic arms, chat,\nand others. CICERO ( FAIR) leveraged LLMs to combine\nstrategic reasoning and natural language to cooperate, ne-\ngotiate, and coordinate with other players to play the game\nDiplomacy at a human level. LLMs have also been em-\nployed to solve text-based games (Yao et al. 2020; Tsai et al.\n2023) and directly write code to convey more complex be-\nhaviors when solving open-ended tasks in Minecraft (Wang\net al. 2023).\nWhile the applications of LLMs in gaming have demon-\nstrated considerable success across a variety of con-\ntexts (Gallotta et al. 2024), a comprehensive exploration of\nthese multimodal capabilities remains unexplored. In this\nwork, we address this gap by specifically investigating their\nvisual, spatial reasoning, and strategic capabilities when\nplaying Atari games.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was sponsored by the Army Research Lab-\noratory and was accomplished under Cooperative Agree-\nment Number W911NF-23-2-0072.

Evolving from these models\nare more advanced multimodal models with the ability to\ntake multiple types of input like text, images, and even au-\ndio, like GPT-4o and Gemini (OpenAI et al. 2024; Reid et al.\n2024; OpenAI 2024b). In addition, with each new iteration\nof these large multimodal models, we see vast improvements\nin efficiency. For example, the development of GPT-4 Turbo\nto GPT-4o to GPT-4o mini highlights the case where sacri-\nficing slight general capabilities improves the inference cost\nand speed (OpenAI 2024a).\nWith each development of these multimodal models, they\nshow potential beyond their traditional conversational task.\nResearchers have investigated their capabilities in areas like\nrobotics and high-level planning in automated systems (Li\net al. 2023; Rana et al. 2023). However, much of the current\nUnder Review\nliterature focuses on utilizing multimodal models for high-\nlevel planning (Xu et al. 2024), leaving their use as low-level\ncontrollers unexplored, akin to what is typically learned by\nreinforcement learning agents in complex environments like\nvideo games.\nTo investigate whether multimodal LLMs can function ef-\nfectively as low-level controllers, we perform initial tests\non GPT-4V (OpenAI et al. 2024), GPT-4o (OpenAI 2024b),\nGemini Flash (DeepMind 2024), and Claude 3 Haiku (An-\nthropic 2024) in Atari.

Our primary focus is assess-\ning the models’ game-playing capabilities and performance\nmeasured by several factors: the game score, visual under-\nstanding, spatial reasoning, and proficiency in devising effi-\ncient game strategies.\nFirst, we evaluate the multimodal LLMs’ performance\nin playing Atari as a low-level policy, judged by each\ngame’s score. This assessment measures the models’ success\nby comparing their performance to standard reinforcement\nlearning algorithms, random agents, and human players, an-\nalyzing how well the models can act as low-level policies by\nmaking decisions based on the current game state.\nSecond, we examine the multimodal LLMs’ visual under-\nstanding and spatial reasoning capabilities. We do this by\ntesting how well the models properly identify different key\nvisual elements within a given frame, understand how these\nelements are related to one another spatially, and the ability\nof the models to create a meaningful strategy based on their\nscene understanding. Additionally, we test if the models are\narXiv:2408.15950v2  [cs.AI]  2 Dec 2024\nFigure 1: Atari-GPT: System diagram: illustrates the integration of a multimodal large language model (LLM) as a low-level\nagent within the Atari gaming environment.

Additionally, the diagram includes the\nframework for human evaluation, which assesses the LLM’s capabilities in visual understanding, spatial reasoning, strategic\nintuition, and environment recognition through a structured Q&A process.\nable to properly identify the game environment when given\nno context other than the image. For testing visual under-\nstanding and spatial reasoning, we use the same set of Atari\nenvironments used to evaluate game-play performance with\nthe addition of another environment, Basic Math.\nThis experimental structure provides a more comprehen-\nsive analysis of the decision-making processes of LLMs by\nassessing their overall understanding of the game environ-\nment within Atari video games, and evaluating their perfor-\nmance as low-level policies. Through this methodology, we\naim to establish a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs in\nlow-level control tasks, exploring how these language mod-\nels compare to humans and learning algorithms.\nExperimental Setup\nGame-Play Experiment\nWe conducted experiments using GPT-4V Turbo, GPT-4o,\nGemini 1.5 Flash and Claude 3 Haiku. We chose these mod-\nels because GPT-4V is considered state-of-the-art perfor-\nmance among the largest frontier LLMs at the time of writ-\ning this paper. GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and Claude 3\nHaiku were selected for their quicker inference speed, an\nimportant feature for real-time decision-making as a low-\nlevel policy. In our tests, the average inference time along\nwith the API call for GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and Claude\n3 Haiku was within 2-3 seconds, while GPT-4 Turbo had an\ninference time of 5-7 seconds.\nWe evaluated the performance in seven Atari games from\nthe Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) (Bellemare et al.\n2013): Space Invaders-v4, Breakout-v4, Seaquest-v4, Pong-\nv4, ALE\/Alien-v5, Ms. PacMan-v4, and ALE\/Frogger-v5.\nIn these experiments, the current game state was presented\nto the LLM, which then generated an action to be executed\nwithin the Atari environment. These models were used as\nlow-level policies, similar to how a reinforcement learning\npolicy, such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN) (Mnih et al. 2013),\nwould act in the environment.\nWe create a system prompt such that the output from the\nmodel is given in a JSON format with two keys, a reasoning\nkey containing the reasoning for why the model took an ac-\ntion and an action key that contains the numerical action the\nmodel would like to take:\n1\n{\n\"reasoning\": \"The player character\nis currently located at the bottom of\nthe screen, near an exit. The\nclosest enemy is directly in front,\none tile up, and could be threatening\nif no action is taken. The best\ncourse of action is to fire upwards\nto eliminate the threat and ensure\nthe path remains clear.\",\n\"action\":\n10 }\n(a) Pong\n(b) Breakout\n(c) Basic Math\n(d) Alien\n(e) Ms. Pacman\n(f) Frogger\n(g) Seaquest\n(h) Space Invaders\nFigure 2: Images used in Understanding tasks\nThis is an example from the environment ALE\/Alien-v5\nfrom GPT-4o. This format was used to encourage chain-of-\nthought reasoning to improve the game-playing performance\nof the LLM (Wei et al. 2023). The system prompt was used\nto maintain consistency in the structure of the output and\ninstruct the model to be a game-play assistant. In addition,\neach of the system prompts was tuned by providing the LLM\nwith the official documentation description of each of the\nAtari environments, specifically giving the model the action\nnames and numerical values, as detailed in the Appendix.\nSince not every frame needs to be given an action and\ninferencing LLMs is computationally intensive, we extend\nthe normal frame skipping of 4 frames in ALE (Bellemare\net al. 2013) to be 8 frames. With this new frame skipping\nwe then conduct a rollout of 1,000 timesteps, where at each\nstep, the model is provided a context buffer of the two pre-\nvious frames and responses, together with the current frame.\nFor the rollout there may be a terminal condition met when\nthe environment is reset, which results in the reward being\ncarried to the next episode. This is done because Atari does\nnot have terminal conditions based on a number of timesteps\nand we wanted to maintain consistency across the results.\nAdditionally, each frame generated is initially of size\n210x160x3 but resized to 512x512x3 for all models. We also\nintroduced error-handling code for cases when the model re-\nsponds with an invalid action, automatically replying to the\nLLM to correct its error.\nVisual And Spatial Reasoning\nWe also investigated the LLMs’ capability to understand and\nreason based on a game frame image. We evaluated the fol-\nlowing models: GPT-4V Turbo, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash,\nClaude 3 Haiku, Gemini Pro 1.5, Gemini Ultra 1.0, Gemini\nPro 1.0, Claude 3 Opus, and Claude 3 Sonnet. This allowed\nus to assess the state of each frontier LLM and compare\ntheir performance across different model types and sizes,\nand across eight environments, as shown in Figure 2. All\nmodels were tested using their respective web interfaces.\nWe created a set of prompts to investigate the models’\nvisual reasoning, spatial reasoning, strategic intuition, and\nability to identify the environment:\n• Visual Understanding: Identify all the key elements in\nthis image. Be specific. Use at most 100 words.\n• Spatial Reasoning: Where are the key elements located\nrelative to each other? Be specific with respect to their\nposition in the image. Use at most 100 words.\n• Strategy: The given image is a screenshot of a game.\nDescribe the ideal next move if you were playing this\ngame. Be specific. Use at most 100 words.\n• Identification: Knowing that the image came from an\nAtari game, identify its name. Be specific.\nTo quantitatively evaluate the performance of the model out-\nputs, we created a rubric outlining the basic answers to\nthe proposed questions, as seen in the Appendix (Table 2).\nGiven that there are several acceptable actions and strate-\ngies, we do not directly define a single correct action or plan\nfor each state. In cases where we investigate the acceptable\nstrategy, we rather evaluate it as either a direct action or strat-\negy\/plan that does not put the agent in harm. Harm includes\nlosing a life or losing points within a game.\nFor each environment, we resize the original frame from\n210x160x3 to 1000x1000x3 and query the LLM together\nwith the visual reasoning prompt. Once a response was re-\nceived, we sent the spatial reasoning prompt, followed by\nthe strategic and identification prompts, respectively. After\nreceiving all outputs, we compared the multimodal LLMs’\noutput with the rubric, resulting in a percent score for that\nenvironment. We repeated this for all environments and\ncomputed the average score over four different trials.\nResults\nGame-Playing Performance\nWe evaluate GPT-4V Turbo, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and\nClaude 3 Haiku across seven Atari environments and com-\npare their scores to a random agent, trained reinforcement\nlearning agent, and human. For each model, we perform\nfour rollouts of 1,000 timesteps and average their cumulative\nreward. We then normalize this average cumulative reward\nagainst the human scores, resulting in a normalized cumula-\ntive reward that relates the LLM scores to the human scores.\nAs seen in Figure 3, GPT-4o performed the best on av-\nerage with a normalized performance of 23.2% and Gemini\n1.5 Flash performed the worst on average with a normalized\nperformance of 8.5%. GPT-4V Turbo presented the second-\nbest performance with a normalized score of 18.36%, and\nClaude 3 Haiku had a normalized performance of 12.36%.\nFigure 4 breaks down the normalized reward for each envi-\nronment, illustrating that the most challenging game for the\nLLM-based policy was Pong.\nFigure 3: Normalized Average Reward for GPT-4V Turbo,\nGPT-4o, and Gemini 1.5 Flash.\nTable 1 presents the raw game-play performance of\nthe four LLMs across the Atari environments. This ta-\nble also includes the performance of human players, pre-\nFigure 4: Average Human Normalized reward for each envi-\nronment.\ntrained Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning\nmodels (Gogianu et al. 2022), and random agents. While\na pre-trained DQN model(Gogianu et al. 2022) trained for\n49,750,000 steps was used for all other environments, a cus-\ntom DQN model was trained from scratch for 1,000,000\ntimesteps for ALE\/Frogger-v5 due to the lack of a pre-\ntrained model. The LLMs did not match the performance\nof the human players or the RL agents. However, they out-\nperformed the random agents, demonstrating a meaningful\nlevel of understanding and ability to play the games. This is\nan important finding, as it indicates that the LLMs are not\nmerely generating random actions but are making decisions\nthat reflect a basic comprehension of the game mechanics.\nSample videos for all rollouts are available in the project\nwebpage1.\nVisual And Spatial Reasoning\nWe further explored the factors influencing game-play per-\nformance by testing the visual, spatial, strategic, and game\nenvironment identification abilities of these LLMs. For each\nenvironment, we evaluated GPT-4V, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5\nFlash, and Claude 3 Haiku using four designed prompts,\nwhich provided insight into why the models may not have\nperformed as well as low-level policies.\nFigure 5 displays the percentage of correct outputs for\neach of the four tasks—visual, spatial, acceptable strategy,\nand identification—across two runs for each model. GPT-\n4o consistently excelled across all tasks, demonstrating high\naccuracy in visual understanding, strategy formulation, and\nenvironment identification. However, it exhibited a notice-\nable decline in spatial reasoning accuracy. This pattern was\nconsistent across all models, suggesting that spatial reason-\ning remains a significant challenge for multimodal large lan-\nguage models and possibly accounting for their relatively\npoor performance on the game-playing tasks. Comprehen-\nsive results for each environment and all models can be\nfound in the Appendix.\n1Atari-GPT project webpage: https:\/\/sites.google.com\/view\/\natari-gpt\/.\nTable 1: Cumulative Reward for 1000 steps without In-Context Learning, * - Custom DQN model trained for 1,000,000\ntimesteps\nEnvironments\nRandom\nAgent\nRL\nAgent\nHuman\nGPT-4V\nTurbo\nGPT-4o\nGemini\n1.5\nFlash\nClaude\n3 Haiku\nFrogger\n26\n30*\n325\n61.25\n66.25\n5.25\n46.5\nBreakout\n3\n23\n37\n5.75\n9.75\n0\n3.25\nPong\n-20\n-8\n2\n-25.25\n-22.5\n-26\n-26\nSpaceInvaders\n100\n725\n575\n258.75\n272.5\n233.75\n197.5\nSeaquest\n80\n620\n680\n105\n135\n15\n40\nAlien\n270\n1670\n2480\n465\n532.5\n80\n305\nMs. Pacman\n280\n3780\n4220\n517.5\n610\n497.5\n395\nFigure 5: Visual, spatial, strategic and identification results.\nPercent average for 2 runs.\nDiscussion\nThis study represents one of the first attempts at benchmark-\ning the emergent capability of multimodal LLMS to act as\nlow-level controllers in Atari game environments, a signifi-\ncant departure from their traditional applications in language\nand visual tasks. The results, while not meeting the perfor-\nmance levels of human players or dedicated reinforcement\nlearning (RL) models, showcase the potential and limita-\ntions of LLMs in this context.\nOur experiments demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit\nsome ability to identify and interact with key elements\nwithin game frames, their performance as low-level con-\ntrollers is subpar, likely due to a lack of training for this\ntask as well as difficulty in spatial reasoning. We observed\na significant performance gap between GPT-4o and Claude\n3 Haiku and Gemini 1.5 Flash. In most cases, we observed\nthat models performed better than random. Though we saw\nperformance worse than random for Pong on all models,\nlikely due to the speed and accuracy requirements to prop-\nerly play the game, and in multiple environments for Gem-\nini 1.5 Flash, likely due to the size of the model. We ob-\nserved neither large nor small models are capable of acting\nas zero-shot low-level controllers. While large models can\ncomprehend the visual content fairly well, they struggle to\nconvert this to spatial reasoning, which makes choosing a\ncorrect action more difficult. This error compounded over\n1,000 frames resulted in poor performance when compared\nto a human player.\nThroughout our testing, we found another key element to\nbe inference time. For these models to realistically be used\nfor game-play tasks they will not only need to be able to see\nan image, interpret, and provide a correct action, but they\nwill need to be quick enough for real-time decision-making.\nOur experiments show that these multimodal models still\nlack enough speed for acting as real-time low-level policies,\nas Gemini 1.5 Flash was the best in terms of inference time\nwith an average inference taking roughly 2 seconds.\nA challenge we encountered was the inconsistency of the\nmodel’s outputs, with GPT-4V Turbo occasionally failing\nto generate appropriate responses coupled with the above-\nmentioned inference time of 5-7 seconds to inference. In ad-\ndition, rate limits for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google APIs\ncontributed heavily to much longer experimentation time,\nadding more overhead to the inherent inference time of these\nmodels. The imposed rate limits currently make it impossi-\nble to run real-time experiments, highlighting the need for\nbetter and faster local multimodal LLMs for fast-paced, low-\nlevel decision-making tasks.\nConclusions\nDespite these setbacks, the findings are invaluable for sev-\neral reasons. First, they contribute to our understanding of\nthe current emergent capabilities and boundaries of LLMs\nwhen applied to low-level control tasks. Second, they offer\na new benchmark for the AI research community to mea-\nsure the progress of LLMs in handling dynamic and visu-\nally complex environments. Adjustments such as tuning the\nmodels’ temperature settings demonstrated some mitigation\nof output inconsistency, suggesting pathways for refining\nLLM performance in these tasks.\nImportantly, the continuous updates to LLM architectures\nand training methods suggest that the capabilities of these\nmodels will evolve, potentially overcoming some of the cur-\nrent deficiencies noted in our study. As such, this research\nshould be viewed as a foundational step that sets the stage\nfor future investigations, encouraging ongoing refinement\nand adaptation of LLMs for applications requiring detailed\nenvironmental interactions and decision-making.\nWhile LLMs have not yet reached the level of proficiency\nrequired to match the best human or RL performances in\nAtari gameplay, their ability to engage in this task at all\nis notable. It demonstrates the adaptability and potential of\nLLMs to extend beyond their original training confines, of-\nfering a glimpse into future emergent applications where\nthese models could serve as more general low-level con-\ntrollers.\nRelated Work\nMultimodal Large Language Models\nProcessing multimodal inputs such as images and sequen-\ntial data has undergone constant evolution in the do-\nmain of deep learning. Before the transformer architec-\nture (Vaswani et al. 2023), Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) (LeCun et al. 1998; Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hin-\nton 2012) for visual processing and Recurrent Neural Net-\nworks (RNNs) (Mikolov et al. 2010) for handling sequen-\ntial data such as text or audio represented the state of the\nart (Mao et al. 2015). Data was processed through separate\ninput networks and their latest outputs were combined via\ndifferent fusion strategies (Mao et al. 2015). Despite achiev-\ning notable success, these approaches were limited in their\nscale and capacity to capture the intricate interactions be-\ntween different modalities, primarily due to the inherent lim-\nitations in sequential data processing and cross-modal syn-\nthesis (Chung et al. 2019).\nThe advent of transformers introduced a more effec-\ntive and scalable mechanism for processing sequential data\nthrough self-attention mechanisms (Vaswani et al. 2023).\nAmong the key developments was the creation of CLIP\n(Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) (Radford et al.\n2021), which leveraged transformers to learn a common la-\ntent space for both visual and linguistic data, leading to a\nmodel that could correlate images in the context of natu-\nral language. This development led to some of the most in-\nfluential Multimodal Large Language Models available to-\nday such as GPT-4 Vision (OpenAI et al. 2024), Gemini\nPro 1.5 (Reid et al. 2024), Gemini Ultra and Pro 1.0 (Team\net al. 2024), Ferret (You et al. 2023), Vicuna (Chiang et al.\n2023), Claude 3 (Anthropic 2024), Multimodal Large Lan-\nguage and Vision Assistant (Liu et al. 2023) and LLaVa (Liu\net al. 2023). Since then, multimodal LLMs have been ap-\nplied to different domains such as designing reward func-\ntions (Ma et al. 2023) and controlling general game-playing\nagents (Abi Raad et al. 2024).\nMultimodal LLMs as Low-Level Policies for\nGames\nLow-level policies act as controllers, processing observa-\ntions from the environment and returning actions. The ac-\ncessibility and complexity of games make them ideal bench-\nmarks for evaluating the performance of such policies (Mnih\net al. 2013; Badia et al. 2020). Traditionally, video game-\nplaying policies have employed reinforcement learning al-\ngorithms (Mnih et al. 2013), behavior cloning (Hussein et al.\n2017), or a combination of both (Goecks et al. 2019). Given\nthe increased performance of multimodal LLMs, they have\nemerged as an alternative to these methods.\nThe rationale for employing multimodal LLMs as low-\nlevel policies in gaming is grounded in their distinctive ca-\npabilities and how they align with the demands of various\ngame environments. When playing social games against one\nanother, LLMs perform well when playing games that re-\nquire valuing their self-interest but sub-optimally when they\nneed to coordinate with other players (Akata et al. 2023).\nWhen fine-tuned on gameplay data, LLMs have been shown\nto learn an internal representation of game states that can be\nused to make predictions (Li et al. 2022). Given their natu-\nral language processing capabilities, LLMs can also directly\nlearn from human-written game manuals to accelerate learn-\ning and improve their performance (Wu et al. 2024).\nSeveral works have demonstrated the capabilities of\nLLMs when playing games. Gato (Reed et al. 2022) lever-\nages a transformer architecture (Vaswani et al. 2023) similar\nto LLMs to tokenize multimodal data from multiple tasks,\nincluding playing games and robotic control, to train a gen-\neralist policy. The same model with the same weights can\nthen play games, caption images, control robotic arms, chat,\nand others. CICERO ( FAIR) leveraged LLMs to combine\nstrategic reasoning and natural language to cooperate, ne-\ngotiate, and coordinate with other players to play the game\nDiplomacy at a human level. LLMs have also been em-\nployed to solve text-based games (Yao et al. 2020; Tsai et al.\n2023) and directly write code to convey more complex be-\nhaviors when solving open-ended tasks in Minecraft (Wang\net al. 2023).\nWhile the applications of LLMs in gaming have demon-\nstrated considerable success across a variety of con-\ntexts (Gallotta et al. 2024), a comprehensive exploration of\nthese multimodal capabilities remains unexplored. In this\nwork, we address this gap by specifically investigating their\nvisual, spatial reasoning, and strategic capabilities when\nplaying Atari games.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was sponsored by the Army Research Lab-\noratory and was accomplished under Cooperative Agree-\nment Number W911NF-23-2-0072.

However, this paradigm\nmakes online RL unsuitable for certain real-world scenarios, such as robotics and autonomous\ndriving [23, 18], as deploying untested policies to the environment can be costly and dangerous [19].\nIn contrast, Offline Reinforcement Learning (Offline RL) can learn satisfactory policies using a\nfixed dataset without the need for further interaction with the environment [23, 18, 7, 19]. This\ncharacteristic alleviates the aforementioned issue, making offline RL potentially more suitable for\ncertain real-world scenarios compared to online RL [23].\nThe research on offline RL has attracted significant attention in recent years and has made substantial\nprogress in both theoretical analysis and practical performance. The core challenge of offline RL is\nthe value overestimation issue induced by distributional shift [9, 21]. Existing studies mitigate this\nproblem by constraining the learning policy to closely resemble the behavior policy induced by the\ndataset [43, 18, 7], or adopting conservative value iteration [19, 16]. The success of offline RL can be\nlargely attributed to the availability of widely-adopted open-access datasets, such as D4RL [6] and RL\nUnplugged [12]. These datasets offer standardized and diverse pre-collected data for the development\nof new algorithms, while also offering proper evaluation protocols that facilitate fair comparisons\nbetween different algorithms. However, despite their benefits, tasks contained in these datasets (such\n* Authors contributed equally\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023) Track on Datasets and Benchmarks.\narXiv:2408.10556v2  [cs.AI]  22 Nov 2024\nas Atari 2600 [3] or Mujoco [39]) are often overly simplistic or purely academic, failing to simulate\nthe complexity of real-world scenarios and lacking practical applications. Thus, there is a significant\ngap between offline RL research and its practical application in real-world settings. This disparity\nhinders the usefulness of offline RL in addressing real-world problems, and thus, it is indispensable\nto create datasets that reflect a realistic level of complexity and practicality in real-world applications.\nOffline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Offline MARL) [29, 47, 36] is gaining increasing\nattention due to its close relationship to real scenarios, such as games [32, 42], sensor networks [53]\nand autonomous vehicle control [46]. However, the lack of standardized datasets restricts the\ndevelopment 40 of offline MARL. Existing works only rely on self-made datasets, which hampers\nfairness and reproducibility. Moreover, the settings they focus on are typically limited to toy examples\n(e.g., Multi-agent Particle Environment [26]) or simplified versions of classic games (e.g., StarCraft\nMulti-Agent Challenge [32]), facing the same impractical issues encountered in offline RL. Thus,\nthere is an urgent need for open-access datasets to further the progress of offline MARL.\nThe connections between offline RL and offline MARL are closely linked due to similar challenges\npertaining to offline learning. While, offline MARL also introduces distinct algorithm development\nrequirements, as it involves unique characteristics like multiple agents and intra-team cooperation.\nThe current offline MARL algorithms [29, 47] are mainly adaptations of offline RL algorithms,\nnecessitating the availability of standardized offline datasets that cater to both single-agent and\nmulti-agent settings. Thus, to enhance versatility and practicality, it is crucial to propose datasets that\nencompass both single-agent settings and multi-agent settings.\nIn this paper, we present Hokoff, a suite of pre-collected datasets for both offline RL and offline\nMARL, along with a comprehensive framework for conducting corresponding research. Our paper\nmakes several novel contributions, which are shown below:\n•\nThe tasks we adopt are based on one of the world’s most popular Multiplayer Online Battle\nArena (MOBA) games, Honor of Kings (HoK), which has over 100 million daily active players[42],\nensuring the practicality of our datasets. The complexity of this environment dramatically surpasses\nthose of its counterparts, demonstrating the potential for simulating real-world scenarios.\n• We present an open-source, easy-to-use framework 1 under Apache License V2.0. This framework\nincludes comprehensive processes for offline RL (sampling, training, and evaluation), and some\nuseful tools. Based on the framework, We release a rich and diverse set of datasets 2 which are\ngenerated using a series of pre-trained models featuring distinct design factors. These datasets cater\nnot only to offline RL but also offline MARL.\n• Building on the framework, we reproduce various offline RL and offline MARL algorithms and\npropose a novel baseline algorithm tailored for the inherent hierarchical structured action space of\nHonor of Kings. We fully validate and compare these baselines on our datasets. The results indicate\nthat current offline RL and offline MARL approaches are unable to effectively address complex\ntasks with discrete action space. Additionally, these methods exhibit shortcomings in terms of their\ngeneralization capabilities and their ability to facilitate multi-task learning.\n2\nRelated Works\n2.1\nOffline RL and Offline MARL\nOffline RL [23, 27] gains significant attention in recent years, primarily due to the inherent difficulties\nof directly applying online RL algorithms to offline environments. The main hurdles encountered is\nthe issue of erroneous value overestimation, which arises from the distributional shift between the\ndataset and the learning policy [9]. Theoretical studies have demonstrated that the overestimation\nissue can be alleviated by pessimism, which results in satisfactory performance even with imperfect\ndata coverage [4, 5, 14, 20, 25, 31, 45, 52]. In practice, certain studies [1, 2, 44, 1, 2, 44] employ\nuncertainty-based methods to estimate Q-values pessimistically or to perform learning on pessimistic\ndynamic models by estimating the epistemic uncertainty of Q-values or dynamics. Some studies [18,\n9, 43, 16, 19, 7] adopt behavior regularization-based approaches by imposing constraints on the\n1https:\/\/github.com\/tencent-ailab\/hokoff\n2https:\/\/sites.google.com\/view\/hok-offline\n2\nlearned policy to align closely with the behavior policy, either explicitly or implicitly, which offers\nbetter computational efficiency and memory consumption compared to uncertainty-based methods.\nOffline MARL [29, 34], combining offline RL and MARL, emerged in recent years to address safety\nand training efficiency concerns in practical multi-agent scenarios. Most studies in this domain adopt\na multi-agent paradigm, such as independent learning [38] or centralized training with decentralized\nexecution (CTDE) [26, 35]. These investigations also incorporat offline methods, similar to those\nemployed in single-agent settings, to mitigate distributional shift. Moreover, innovative treatments\nare introduced for cooperation, such as zeroth-order optimization in OMAR [29] or decomposing\nthe joint-policy in MAICQ [47]. In addition, Jiang & Lu [13] specifically focuses on decentralized\nlearning using BCQ [9], while Tseng et al. [40] regards offline MARL as a sequence modeling\nproblem, utilizing supervised learning and knowledge distillation to tackle the challenges it presents.\n2.2\nOffline Datasets\nThe availability of large-scale pre-collected datasets has greatly facilitated the progress of deep\nsupervised learning [11]. Offline RL, which is regarded as a bridge between RL and supervised\nlearning, also requires learning policies from pre-collected datasets [6]. Therefore, high-quality\npre-collected offline datasets play a significant role in the development of offline RL. To meet this\ndemand, some datasets have been published and widely adopted. D4RL [6] is designed to address\nkey challenges often faced in practical applications where datasets may have limited and biased\ndistributions, incomplete observations, and suboptimal data. To tackle these issues, D4RL offers\na range of datasets that enjoy these characteristics. Similarly, RL Unplugged [12] introduces a\nbenchmark to evaluate and compare offline RL methods with various settings, such as partially or\nfully observable and continuous or discrete actions. These offline datasets play a significant role\nin offline RL research, and many previous works train and evaluate their methods based on these\ndatasets [16, 2, 15, 29, 47].\nHowever, both D4RL and RL Unplugged primarily focus on relatively simple tasks and lack high-\ndimensional, practical and multi-agent tasks that closely resemble real-world scenarios. StarCraft\nII Unplugged [28] introduces a benchmark for StarCraft II, a complex simulated environment with\nseveral practical properties. However, they only utilize a dataset derived from human replays, which\nlacks diversity in design for offline RL, and they did not evaluate existing offline RL methods. To\naddress this research gap, we propose Hokoff, a benchmark based on HoK, which aims to provide\ndiverse offline datasets for high-dimensional, practical tasks, and present a comprehensive evaluation\nof previous offline RL and offline MARL methods with a general, easy-to-use framework.\n3\nBackground\nHonor of Kings (HoK) is one of the most popular MOBA games worldwide, boasting over 100 million\ndaily active players [42]. The game involves two teams, each consisting of several players who have\nthe option to select from a wide range of heroes with diverse roles and abilities. In the game, heroes\nare expected to eliminate enemy units, such as heroes, creeps, and turrets, to gain gold and experience.\nThe primary objective is to destroy the enemies’ turrets and crystal while defending their own. To\nsucceed in MOBA games, players must learn how to choose the appropriate hero combination, master\ncomplex information processing and action control, plan for long-term decision-making, cooperate\nwith allies, and balance multiple interests. The complex rules and properties of HoK make it be\nmore in line with the complex decision-making behavior of human society. Thus, HoK has attracted\nnumerous researchers interest [49, 48, 42, 41, 10].\nThe underlying system dynamic of HoK can be characterized by a Partially Observable Markov\nDecision Process (POMDP [37]), denoted by M = (S, O, A, P, r, γ, d). Due to the fog of war and\nprivate features, each agent has access to only local observations o rather than the global state s.\nSpecifically, the agents are limited to perceiving information about game units within their field\nof view, as well as certain global features. Due to the intricate nature of control, the action space\nA is organized in a hierarchically structured manner, rather than being flattened, which avoids the\nrepresentation of millions of discretized actions. Randomness is added into the transition distribution\nP in the form of critical hit rate. The reward r is decomposed into multi-head form and each hero’s\nreward is a weighted sum of different reward items and is designed to be zero-sum. Details of\nobservation space, action space and reward are presented in Appendix D.\n3\n(a) HoK1v1\n(b) HoK3v3\nFigure 1: (a) The Game replay user interface (UI) in HoK1v1. (b) The UI in HoK3v3. Important\ninformation and units of the game are highlighted using orange boxes.\n4\nHokoff\nThis study is based on the HoK gaming environment, which encompasses both 1v1 and 3v3 maps.\nOur research proposes a comprehensive offline RL framework applicable to this gaming environment\nand utilizes it to generate diverse datasets. This section provides an introduction to the framework,\ngame modes, datasets, and evaluation protocol employed in this study.\n4.1\nFramework\nTo enhance the usability of our Hokoff, we propose a reliable and comprehensive Offline RL\nframework that consists of three modules: sampling, training, and evaluation. This framework\nstreamlines the process of sampling new datasets, developing and training baselines, and evaluating\ntheir performance. The sampling module provides a simple and unified program for sampling diverse\ndatasets using any pre-trained checkpoints. There are several reasons why our framework excels\nin sampling. Firstly, diverse datasets at different levels of expertise can be sampled by leveraging\nMulti-Level Models as described in Sec. 4.1.1. Secondly, our framework employs parallel sampling\ntechniques, ensuring efficient sampling of large and diverse datasets. Based on the training module,\nwe have implemented various offline RL and offline MARL algorithms as baselines. Additionally, we\nconsolidate crucial components and provide user-friendly APIs, facilitating researchers to effortlessly\ndevelop novel algorithms or innovative network architectures. The evaluation module enables\nthe assessment of trained models from different algorithms, ensuring fair comparisons. Fig. 2\ndemonstrates the architecture of our framework and Appendix E provides an example of the APIs.\n4.1.1\nMulti-Level Models\nTo ensure a valid and unbiased comparison of the performance of distinct algorithms, it is crucial\nto establish appropriate evaluation protocols [6, 12]. One such effective evaluation protocol is the\nnormalized score [6]. However, HoK is a zero-sum adjustable rewards MOBA game. The episode\nreturn in the game is heavily influenced by the opponents and game settings, and the objective is to\nwin, which renders the use of return as a performance metric biased. Therefore, normalized score may\nnot fully capture our requirements. Furthermore, similar to our situation, the evaluation protocol for\nSMAC [32], a competitive game, is based on win rate against a pre-programmed AI. Nonetheless, it\nis exceedingly challenging to create a built-in AI with human-like performance due to the complexity\nof MOBA games.\nInspired by prior works of HoK [42], we present Multi-Level Models for sampling and evaluating\nwhich contains multiple checkpoints with different level. Specifically, we have extracted several\ncheckpoints from pre-trained dual-clip PPO [49, 48] models with varying levels determined by the\noutcome of the battle separately for HoK1v1 and HoK3v3. We adopt the win rate against different\ncheckpoints as our evaluation protocols to assess the ability of models. Additionally, these models,\nwith varying levels, can be utilized on both sides to sample diverse battle data. The capabilities of\nthese models surpass those of rule-based AI and match the levels of different human players, thus\nmaking these evaluation protocols more suitable for comparing algorithmic performance with human-\nlevel performance and facilitating diverse and effortless sampling. The details of these Multi-Level\nModels are provided in the Appendix F.\n4\nFigure 2: The architecture of the framework. The sampling and evaluation modules should interact\nwith the environment. Multi-Level Models are the foundation baseline models of these two modules,\nserving as opponents in the evaluation module and being on both sides in the sampling module, as\ndescribed in Sec 4.1.1. The training module is responsible for training offline RL algorithms using\nfixed datasets and producing trained models for evaluation.\n4.2\nGame Modes\nWe have incorporated two game modes from HoK into our study, namely HoK1v1 [42] and HoK3v3.\nThe environment code of HoK3v3 is integrated into the open-source HoK1v1 code3, following\nApache License V2.0. These game modes differ in the number of agents involved and the underlying\nmap used. Detailed information on each game mode is presented below.\n4.2.1\nHonor of Kings Arena\nHonor of Kings Arena (HoK Arena or HoK1v1) is a 1v1 game mode where each player attempts to\nbeat the other and destroy its opponent’s crystal. Specifically, each player chooses a hero before the\ngame starts and controls it during the whole game. There are a total of 20 heroes available for players\nto select, each possessing distinct skills that exert diverse effects on the game environment. The\nobservation space is a continuous space consisting of 725 dimensions that contain partial observable\ninformation about the hero, opponent, and other game units. The action space is hierarchically\nstructured and discretized, covering all possible actions of the hero in a hierarchical triplet form:\n(1) which action button to take; (2) who to target; and (3) how to act. Furthermore, the reward is a\nweighted sum of five categories: farming, kill-death-assist (KDA) , damage, pushing, and win-lose.\nFor a full description of this game mode, please refer to the Appendix D.1.\n4.2.2\nHonor of Kings 3v3 Arena\nTo further cater to the demand for Offline MARL, we adopt Honor of Kings 3v3 Arena (HoK3v3) as\nour experimental platform. HoK3v3 is a MOBA game, where each team comprises three heroes who\ncollaborate to defeat their opponents. The basic rules and win conditions of HoK3v3 are similar to\nHoK1v1. However, the HoK3v3 map contains additional turrets on the middle road and features a\nnew area called the \"wilderness\", inhabited by diverse monsters. Besides, collaboration is essential in\nHoK3v3, where players must select different heroes and fulfill distinct roles to work together more\nefficiently. For instance, one hero might focus on slaying monsters in the wilderness to earn gold and\nexperience, while the other heroes engage in offensive tactics against the enemy heroes and game\nunits. The design philosophies for observation space, action space, and reward are comparable to\nthose used in HoK1v1. However, the level of complexity in HoK3v3 is significantly elevated. We\nprovide a detailed description of the game mode in the Appendix D.2 for reference.\n3https:\/\/github.com\/tencent-ailab\/hok_env\n5\n4.2.3\nSubtasks\nBoth HoK1v1 and HoK3v3 are full MOBA games, featuring multi-camp competitions, which\ninherently pose challenges and limitations. Consequently, training on these game modes demands\nextensive training time and computational resources. However, HoK game comprises various sub-\nobjectives, allowing us to decompose the overall game into manageable subtasks. These subtasks\ncan represent diverse scenarios and are suitable for evaluating various algorithms. In this study, we\npropose two specific noncompetitive subtasks as outlined below. It is worth noting that researchers\ncan readily expand upon our framework to develop additional subtasks.\nDestroy Turret: One of the key sub-objectives in HoK is to destroy the enemy’s turrets as quickly as\npossible, to gain access to the enemy crystal. To train this specific skill, we have devised a subtask\ncalled Destroy Turret, which is based on HoK1v1. In this subtask, the focus is solely on destroying\nthe enemy’s turret and crystal as quickly as possible, and the enemy hero is removed.\nGain Gold: Gold is a critical resource in HoK that can be used to purchase equipment, which\nenhances the abilities of the heroes. Inspired by resource collection tasks from previous studies [22],\nwe have designed a subtask called Gain Gold, which is based on HoK3v3, where the new objective is\nto collect golds in restricted time steps, and the enemy heroes are removed. As a multi-agent setting,\nit focuses on the cooperation or intra-team competition while avoiding inter-team competition.\n4.3\nDatasets\nTo enhance the practical implications of our datasets, we have incorporated design factors that align\nwith the real-world applications of both HoK and other relevant scenarios.\nMulti-Difficulty\nIntuitively, the level of difficulty in the environment significantly impacts the performance of al-\ngorithms. However, previous researches only utilized one set of datasets with a uniform level of\ndifficulty in the environment, which is not appropriate for HoK, where the difficulty of the task can\nbe substantially affected by the level of opponents. Therefore, to examine the effects of varying levels\nof difficulty in the environment, we propose several multi-difficulty datasets with different difficulty\nlevels. Specifically, we develop two sets of datasets: norm and hard, which are categorized based\non the opponent’s level. Within each level, we propose four datasets according to diverse win rates\nagainst the opponent: poor, medium, expert and mixed. To elaborate, the poor\/medium\/expert dataset\nis generated by recording the battle trajectories of a relative lower\/equal\/higher level model compared\nto the opponent, and the mixed dataset is an equal mixture of the three datasets mentioned above.\nMulti-Task\nAs a MOBA game, HoK features a diverse cast of heroes with distinct roles and skillsets. While the\noverall objective remains consistent throughout matches, the selection of heroes can significantly\nalter the nature of the task at hand. Consequently, HoK presents multi-task challenge which requires\na single model to handle multiple tasks [51, 24, 50]. However, none of the current works provide\nuniform datasets for multi-task offline RL. To address this research gap, we propose a series of\nmulti-task datasets based on the multi-task nature of HoK and evaluate the multi-task learning ability\nof current offline RL and offline MARL algorithms. Specifically, we define a hero pool with several\nheroes and randomly select heroes from it to sample data. Depending on whether the selected heroes\nare on the controlled side or the opponent side, we sample either the multi_hero or the multi_oppo\ndataset. In cases where both sides choose random heroes, we sample the multi_hero_oppo dataset.\nFurthermore, as mentioned in the previous section, different levels of opponents naturally form\nmultiple tasks with varying environmental difficulties. Thus, we propose several level-based multi-\ntask datasets by sampling data with randomly selected opponent levels. According to different\ndifficulty levels, we have proposed two datasets, named norm_multi_level and hard_multi_level.\nGeneralization\nThe unique gameplay mechanics of HoK, characterized by a diverse cast of heroes with distinct\nroles and skillsets, lend themselves well to multi-task and serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating\nthe generality of models across a range of tasks. Building on the previous work [42] and taking\ninto account the realities of human combat in HoK, we have identified three key challenges for\ngeneralization: hero generalization, opponent generalization, and level generalization.\n6\nWe have developed six experiments: \"norm_general\" and \"hard_general\" for level generalization,\n\"norm_hero_general\" and \"hard_hero_general\" for hero generalization, and \"norm_oppo_general\"\nand \"hard_oppo_general\" for opponent generalization, for HoK1v1 and HoK3v3, respectively.\nAmong them, the first two experiments, \"norm_general\" and \"hard_general,\" have their corresponding\ndatasets, and we train models on these datasets. The latter four experiments do not require extra\ndatasets because we directly use the existing models that have already been trained using other\ndatasets. For more details on the design of generalization, please refer to the Appendix C.\nHeterogeneous Teammate\nHeterogeneous teammate is a crucial research direction in MARL [33, 17]. In the practical scenarios\nof HoK, the capacity of each player is generally different, making it naturally suitable for investigating\nthe challenges associated with heterogeneous teammate. In order to mimic real-world scenarios\nand facilitate research on heterogeneous teammate challenges, we design two datasets in HoK3v3:\nnorm_stupid_partner and norm_expert_partner. These datasets were collected in a standard manner,\nwith the exception that one random hero in each team is controlled by a model with a relatively\nlow\/high level of expertise, while the remaining heroes are controlled by the regular model.\nSub-Task\nAs introduced in Sec 4.2.3, we designed several practical and meaningful sub-tasks to provide diverse\nscenarios based on HoK. Based on these sub-tasks, we proposed diverse datasets to support Offline\nRL research similar to the design of previous studies [6, 12].\nTable 1: Details of datasets in HoK1v1 game mode\nFactors\nDatasets\/Experiments\nCapacity\nHeroes\nOppo_heroes\nWin_rate\nLevels\nMulti-Difficulty\nnorm_poor\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n12%\n1\nnorm_medium\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n50%\n1\nnorm_expert\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n88%\n1\nnorm_mixed\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n50%\n1\nhard_poor\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n6%\n5\nhard_medium\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n50%\n5\nhard_expert\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n84%\n5\nhard_mixed\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n45%\n5\nGeneralization\nhard_general\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n90%\n5\nnorm_general\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n46%\n1\nnorm_hero_general\n-\nmulti_hero\ndefault\n-\n1\nhard_hero_general\n-\nmulti_hero\ndefault\n-\n5\nnorm_oppo_general\n-\ndefault\nmulti_hero\n-\n1\nhard_oppo_general\n-\ndefault\nmulti_hero\n-\n5\nMulti-Task\nnorm_multi_level\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n50%\n1\nhard_multi_level\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n50%\n5\nnorm_multi_hero\n1000\nmulti_hero\ndefault\n23%\n1\nnorm_multi_oppo\n1000\ndefault\nmulti_hero\n77%\n1\nnorm_multi_hero_oppo\n1000\nmulti_hero\nmulti_hero\n50%\n1\n4.3.1\nDatasets Details\nTable 1, Table 2 and Table 3presents the details of our proposed datasets. All the datasets are sampled\nusing checkpoints with different levels as introduced in Sec. 4.1.1. Typically, each dataset consists of\n1000 trajectories, except for the sub-task datasets, which contain 100 trajectories. The default heroes\nchosen for both camps are luban with Summoner Spells set to frenzy in HoK1v1 and {{zhaoyun},\n{diaochan}, {liyuanfang}} with Summoner Spells assigned as {{smite}, {purify}, {purify}} based\non their respective roles in HoK3v3. However, in specific scenarios such as Generalization or\nMulti-Task settings, we employ a random selection of heroes from a predefined set, multi_hero. For\nthe HoK1v1 mode, the set comprises five heroes, {luban, direnjie, houyi, makeboluo, gongsunli}.\nIn HoK3v3, the set consists six heroes, with two heroes assigned to each role, namely {{zhaoyun,\nzhongwuyan}, {diaochan, zhugeliang}, {liyuanfang, sunshangxiang}}. The win rate of the behavior\npolicy is recorded in the column labeled Win_rate for reference. The column labeled Levels denotes\nthe levels of opponents used for evaluation.

Besides,\nwe fully validate and compare these baselines on our datasets. The results are presented in the form of\ntest winning rate. Each algorithm is run for three random seeds, and we report the mean performance\nwith standard deviation. The performance of behaviour policies is presented in Appendix C. Details\nof the implementations and experimental results can be referenced in Appendix G.\n5.1\nBaselines\n5.1.1\nHoK1v1\nThe Offline RL baseline algorithms we implement are briefly introduced below: BC: Behavior\ncloning. TD3+BC [7]: One of the state-of-the-art single agent offline algorithm, simply adding the\nBC term to TD3 [8]. CQL [19]: Conservative Q-Learning conducts conservative value iteration by\nadding a regularizer to the critic loss. IQL [16]: Implicit Q-Learning leverages upper expectile value\nfunction to learn Q-function and extracts policy via advantage-weighted behavioral cloning.\nThe structured action space in HoK is similar to the joint action space in multi-agent settings, which\ninspires us to resort to the design in MARL methods. We propose a novel baseline algorithm, named\nQMIX+CQL. Specifically, we import QMIX algorithm from the MARL literature [30] to tackle the\nstructured action space by regarding each head of the action space as a single agent and incorporate\nCQL regularizer term into local Q-funtion in QMIX for offline learning.\n8\n5.1.2\nHoK3v3\nThe Offline MARL baseline algorithms are briefly introduced below: IND+BC: Behavior cloning\nwith independent learning paradigm. IND+CQL: Adopts an independent learning paradigm for\nmulti-agent settings, using conservative Q-learning [19]. COMM+CQL: Incorporate inter-agent\ncommunication based on IND+CQL.

However, this paradigm\nmakes online RL unsuitable for certain real-world scenarios, such as robotics and autonomous\ndriving [23, 18], as deploying untested policies to the environment can be costly and dangerous [19].\nIn contrast, Offline Reinforcement Learning (Offline RL) can learn satisfactory policies using a\nfixed dataset without the need for further interaction with the environment [23, 18, 7, 19]. This\ncharacteristic alleviates the aforementioned issue, making offline RL potentially more suitable for\ncertain real-world scenarios compared to online RL [23].\nThe research on offline RL has attracted significant attention in recent years and has made substantial\nprogress in both theoretical analysis and practical performance. The core challenge of offline RL is\nthe value overestimation issue induced by distributional shift [9, 21]. Existing studies mitigate this\nproblem by constraining the learning policy to closely resemble the behavior policy induced by the\ndataset [43, 18, 7], or adopting conservative value iteration [19, 16]. The success of offline RL can be\nlargely attributed to the availability of widely-adopted open-access datasets, such as D4RL [6] and RL\nUnplugged [12]. These datasets offer standardized and diverse pre-collected data for the development\nof new algorithms, while also offering proper evaluation protocols that facilitate fair comparisons\nbetween different algorithms. However, despite their benefits, tasks contained in these datasets (such\n* Authors contributed equally\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023) Track on Datasets and Benchmarks.\narXiv:2408.10556v2  [cs.AI]  22 Nov 2024\nas Atari 2600 [3] or Mujoco [39]) are often overly simplistic or purely academic, failing to simulate\nthe complexity of real-world scenarios and lacking practical applications. Thus, there is a significant\ngap between offline RL research and its practical application in real-world settings. This disparity\nhinders the usefulness of offline RL in addressing real-world problems, and thus, it is indispensable\nto create datasets that reflect a realistic level of complexity and practicality in real-world applications.\nOffline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Offline MARL) [29, 47, 36] is gaining increasing\nattention due to its close relationship to real scenarios, such as games [32, 42], sensor networks [53]\nand autonomous vehicle control [46]. However, the lack of standardized datasets restricts the\ndevelopment 40 of offline MARL. Existing works only rely on self-made datasets, which hampers\nfairness and reproducibility. Moreover, the settings they focus on are typically limited to toy examples\n(e.g., Multi-agent Particle Environment [26]) or simplified versions of classic games (e.g., StarCraft\nMulti-Agent Challenge [32]), facing the same impractical issues encountered in offline RL. Thus,\nthere is an urgent need for open-access datasets to further the progress of offline MARL.\nThe connections between offline RL and offline MARL are closely linked due to similar challenges\npertaining to offline learning. While, offline MARL also introduces distinct algorithm development\nrequirements, as it involves unique characteristics like multiple agents and intra-team cooperation.\nThe current offline MARL algorithms [29, 47] are mainly adaptations of offline RL algorithms,\nnecessitating the availability of standardized offline datasets that cater to both single-agent and\nmulti-agent settings. Thus, to enhance versatility and practicality, it is crucial to propose datasets that\nencompass both single-agent settings and multi-agent settings.\nIn this paper, we present Hokoff, a suite of pre-collected datasets for both offline RL and offline\nMARL, along with a comprehensive framework for conducting corresponding research. Our paper\nmakes several novel contributions, which are shown below:\n•\nThe tasks we adopt are based on one of the world’s most popular Multiplayer Online Battle\nArena (MOBA) games, Honor of Kings (HoK), which has over 100 million daily active players[42],\nensuring the practicality of our datasets. The complexity of this environment dramatically surpasses\nthose of its counterparts, demonstrating the potential for simulating real-world scenarios.\n• We present an open-source, easy-to-use framework 1 under Apache License V2.0. This framework\nincludes comprehensive processes for offline RL (sampling, training, and evaluation), and some\nuseful tools. Based on the framework, We release a rich and diverse set of datasets 2 which are\ngenerated using a series of pre-trained models featuring distinct design factors. These datasets cater\nnot only to offline RL but also offline MARL.\n• Building on the framework, we reproduce various offline RL and offline MARL algorithms and\npropose a novel baseline algorithm tailored for the inherent hierarchical structured action space of\nHonor of Kings. We fully validate and compare these baselines on our datasets. The results indicate\nthat current offline RL and offline MARL approaches are unable to effectively address complex\ntasks with discrete action space. Additionally, these methods exhibit shortcomings in terms of their\ngeneralization capabilities and their ability to facilitate multi-task learning.\n2\nRelated Works\n2.1\nOffline RL and Offline MARL\nOffline RL [23, 27] gains significant attention in recent years, primarily due to the inherent difficulties\nof directly applying online RL algorithms to offline environments. The main hurdles encountered is\nthe issue of erroneous value overestimation, which arises from the distributional shift between the\ndataset and the learning policy [9]. Theoretical studies have demonstrated that the overestimation\nissue can be alleviated by pessimism, which results in satisfactory performance even with imperfect\ndata coverage [4, 5, 14, 20, 25, 31, 45, 52]. In practice, certain studies [1, 2, 44, 1, 2, 44] employ\nuncertainty-based methods to estimate Q-values pessimistically or to perform learning on pessimistic\ndynamic models by estimating the epistemic uncertainty of Q-values or dynamics. Some studies [18,\n9, 43, 16, 19, 7] adopt behavior regularization-based approaches by imposing constraints on the\n1https:\/\/github.com\/tencent-ailab\/hokoff\n2https:\/\/sites.google.com\/view\/hok-offline\n2\nlearned policy to align closely with the behavior policy, either explicitly or implicitly, which offers\nbetter computational efficiency and memory consumption compared to uncertainty-based methods.\nOffline MARL [29, 34], combining offline RL and MARL, emerged in recent years to address safety\nand training efficiency concerns in practical multi-agent scenarios. Most studies in this domain adopt\na multi-agent paradigm, such as independent learning [38] or centralized training with decentralized\nexecution (CTDE) [26, 35]. These investigations also incorporat offline methods, similar to those\nemployed in single-agent settings, to mitigate distributional shift. Moreover, innovative treatments\nare introduced for cooperation, such as zeroth-order optimization in OMAR [29] or decomposing\nthe joint-policy in MAICQ [47]. In addition, Jiang & Lu [13] specifically focuses on decentralized\nlearning using BCQ [9], while Tseng et al. [40] regards offline MARL as a sequence modeling\nproblem, utilizing supervised learning and knowledge distillation to tackle the challenges it presents.\n2.2\nOffline Datasets\nThe availability of large-scale pre-collected datasets has greatly facilitated the progress of deep\nsupervised learning [11]. Offline RL, which is regarded as a bridge between RL and supervised\nlearning, also requires learning policies from pre-collected datasets [6]. Therefore, high-quality\npre-collected offline datasets play a significant role in the development of offline RL. To meet this\ndemand, some datasets have been published and widely adopted. D4RL [6] is designed to address\nkey challenges often faced in practical applications where datasets may have limited and biased\ndistributions, incomplete observations, and suboptimal data. To tackle these issues, D4RL offers\na range of datasets that enjoy these characteristics. Similarly, RL Unplugged [12] introduces a\nbenchmark to evaluate and compare offline RL methods with various settings, such as partially or\nfully observable and continuous or discrete actions. These offline datasets play a significant role\nin offline RL research, and many previous works train and evaluate their methods based on these\ndatasets [16, 2, 15, 29, 47].\nHowever, both D4RL and RL Unplugged primarily focus on relatively simple tasks and lack high-\ndimensional, practical and multi-agent tasks that closely resemble real-world scenarios. StarCraft\nII Unplugged [28] introduces a benchmark for StarCraft II, a complex simulated environment with\nseveral practical properties. However, they only utilize a dataset derived from human replays, which\nlacks diversity in design for offline RL, and they did not evaluate existing offline RL methods. To\naddress this research gap, we propose Hokoff, a benchmark based on HoK, which aims to provide\ndiverse offline datasets for high-dimensional, practical tasks, and present a comprehensive evaluation\nof previous offline RL and offline MARL methods with a general, easy-to-use framework.\n3\nBackground\nHonor of Kings (HoK) is one of the most popular MOBA games worldwide, boasting over 100 million\ndaily active players [42]. The game involves two teams, each consisting of several players who have\nthe option to select from a wide range of heroes with diverse roles and abilities. In the game, heroes\nare expected to eliminate enemy units, such as heroes, creeps, and turrets, to gain gold and experience.\nThe primary objective is to destroy the enemies’ turrets and crystal while defending their own. To\nsucceed in MOBA games, players must learn how to choose the appropriate hero combination, master\ncomplex information processing and action control, plan for long-term decision-making, cooperate\nwith allies, and balance multiple interests. The complex rules and properties of HoK make it be\nmore in line with the complex decision-making behavior of human society. Thus, HoK has attracted\nnumerous researchers interest [49, 48, 42, 41, 10].\nThe underlying system dynamic of HoK can be characterized by a Partially Observable Markov\nDecision Process (POMDP [37]), denoted by M = (S, O, A, P, r, γ, d). Due to the fog of war and\nprivate features, each agent has access to only local observations o rather than the global state s.\nSpecifically, the agents are limited to perceiving information about game units within their field\nof view, as well as certain global features. Due to the intricate nature of control, the action space\nA is organized in a hierarchically structured manner, rather than being flattened, which avoids the\nrepresentation of millions of discretized actions. Randomness is added into the transition distribution\nP in the form of critical hit rate. The reward r is decomposed into multi-head form and each hero’s\nreward is a weighted sum of different reward items and is designed to be zero-sum. Details of\nobservation space, action space and reward are presented in Appendix D.\n3\n(a) HoK1v1\n(b) HoK3v3\nFigure 1: (a) The Game replay user interface (UI) in HoK1v1. (b) The UI in HoK3v3. Important\ninformation and units of the game are highlighted using orange boxes.\n4\nHokoff\nThis study is based on the HoK gaming environment, which encompasses both 1v1 and 3v3 maps.\nOur research proposes a comprehensive offline RL framework applicable to this gaming environment\nand utilizes it to generate diverse datasets. This section provides an introduction to the framework,\ngame modes, datasets, and evaluation protocol employed in this study.\n4.1\nFramework\nTo enhance the usability of our Hokoff, we propose a reliable and comprehensive Offline RL\nframework that consists of three modules: sampling, training, and evaluation. This framework\nstreamlines the process of sampling new datasets, developing and training baselines, and evaluating\ntheir performance. The sampling module provides a simple and unified program for sampling diverse\ndatasets using any pre-trained checkpoints. There are several reasons why our framework excels\nin sampling. Firstly, diverse datasets at different levels of expertise can be sampled by leveraging\nMulti-Level Models as described in Sec. 4.1.1. Secondly, our framework employs parallel sampling\ntechniques, ensuring efficient sampling of large and diverse datasets. Based on the training module,\nwe have implemented various offline RL and offline MARL algorithms as baselines. Additionally, we\nconsolidate crucial components and provide user-friendly APIs, facilitating researchers to effortlessly\ndevelop novel algorithms or innovative network architectures. The evaluation module enables\nthe assessment of trained models from different algorithms, ensuring fair comparisons. Fig. 2\ndemonstrates the architecture of our framework and Appendix E provides an example of the APIs.\n4.1.1\nMulti-Level Models\nTo ensure a valid and unbiased comparison of the performance of distinct algorithms, it is crucial\nto establish appropriate evaluation protocols [6, 12]. One such effective evaluation protocol is the\nnormalized score [6]. However, HoK is a zero-sum adjustable rewards MOBA game. The episode\nreturn in the game is heavily influenced by the opponents and game settings, and the objective is to\nwin, which renders the use of return as a performance metric biased. Therefore, normalized score may\nnot fully capture our requirements. Furthermore, similar to our situation, the evaluation protocol for\nSMAC [32], a competitive game, is based on win rate against a pre-programmed AI. Nonetheless, it\nis exceedingly challenging to create a built-in AI with human-like performance due to the complexity\nof MOBA games.\nInspired by prior works of HoK [42], we present Multi-Level Models for sampling and evaluating\nwhich contains multiple checkpoints with different level. Specifically, we have extracted several\ncheckpoints from pre-trained dual-clip PPO [49, 48] models with varying levels determined by the\noutcome of the battle separately for HoK1v1 and HoK3v3. We adopt the win rate against different\ncheckpoints as our evaluation protocols to assess the ability of models. Additionally, these models,\nwith varying levels, can be utilized on both sides to sample diverse battle data. The capabilities of\nthese models surpass those of rule-based AI and match the levels of different human players, thus\nmaking these evaluation protocols more suitable for comparing algorithmic performance with human-\nlevel performance and facilitating diverse and effortless sampling. The details of these Multi-Level\nModels are provided in the Appendix F.\n4\nFigure 2: The architecture of the framework. The sampling and evaluation modules should interact\nwith the environment. Multi-Level Models are the foundation baseline models of these two modules,\nserving as opponents in the evaluation module and being on both sides in the sampling module, as\ndescribed in Sec 4.1.1. The training module is responsible for training offline RL algorithms using\nfixed datasets and producing trained models for evaluation.\n4.2\nGame Modes\nWe have incorporated two game modes from HoK into our study, namely HoK1v1 [42] and HoK3v3.\nThe environment code of HoK3v3 is integrated into the open-source HoK1v1 code3, following\nApache License V2.0. These game modes differ in the number of agents involved and the underlying\nmap used. Detailed information on each game mode is presented below.\n4.2.1\nHonor of Kings Arena\nHonor of Kings Arena (HoK Arena or HoK1v1) is a 1v1 game mode where each player attempts to\nbeat the other and destroy its opponent’s crystal. Specifically, each player chooses a hero before the\ngame starts and controls it during the whole game. There are a total of 20 heroes available for players\nto select, each possessing distinct skills that exert diverse effects on the game environment. The\nobservation space is a continuous space consisting of 725 dimensions that contain partial observable\ninformation about the hero, opponent, and other game units. The action space is hierarchically\nstructured and discretized, covering all possible actions of the hero in a hierarchical triplet form:\n(1) which action button to take; (2) who to target; and (3) how to act. Furthermore, the reward is a\nweighted sum of five categories: farming, kill-death-assist (KDA) , damage, pushing, and win-lose.\nFor a full description of this game mode, please refer to the Appendix D.1.\n4.2.2\nHonor of Kings 3v3 Arena\nTo further cater to the demand for Offline MARL, we adopt Honor of Kings 3v3 Arena (HoK3v3) as\nour experimental platform. HoK3v3 is a MOBA game, where each team comprises three heroes who\ncollaborate to defeat their opponents. The basic rules and win conditions of HoK3v3 are similar to\nHoK1v1. However, the HoK3v3 map contains additional turrets on the middle road and features a\nnew area called the \"wilderness\", inhabited by diverse monsters. Besides, collaboration is essential in\nHoK3v3, where players must select different heroes and fulfill distinct roles to work together more\nefficiently. For instance, one hero might focus on slaying monsters in the wilderness to earn gold and\nexperience, while the other heroes engage in offensive tactics against the enemy heroes and game\nunits. The design philosophies for observation space, action space, and reward are comparable to\nthose used in HoK1v1. However, the level of complexity in HoK3v3 is significantly elevated. We\nprovide a detailed description of the game mode in the Appendix D.2 for reference.\n3https:\/\/github.com\/tencent-ailab\/hok_env\n5\n4.2.3\nSubtasks\nBoth HoK1v1 and HoK3v3 are full MOBA games, featuring multi-camp competitions, which\ninherently pose challenges and limitations. Consequently, training on these game modes demands\nextensive training time and computational resources. However, HoK game comprises various sub-\nobjectives, allowing us to decompose the overall game into manageable subtasks. These subtasks\ncan represent diverse scenarios and are suitable for evaluating various algorithms. In this study, we\npropose two specific noncompetitive subtasks as outlined below. It is worth noting that researchers\ncan readily expand upon our framework to develop additional subtasks.\nDestroy Turret: One of the key sub-objectives in HoK is to destroy the enemy’s turrets as quickly as\npossible, to gain access to the enemy crystal. To train this specific skill, we have devised a subtask\ncalled Destroy Turret, which is based on HoK1v1. In this subtask, the focus is solely on destroying\nthe enemy’s turret and crystal as quickly as possible, and the enemy hero is removed.\nGain Gold: Gold is a critical resource in HoK that can be used to purchase equipment, which\nenhances the abilities of the heroes. Inspired by resource collection tasks from previous studies [22],\nwe have designed a subtask called Gain Gold, which is based on HoK3v3, where the new objective is\nto collect golds in restricted time steps, and the enemy heroes are removed. As a multi-agent setting,\nit focuses on the cooperation or intra-team competition while avoiding inter-team competition.\n4.3\nDatasets\nTo enhance the practical implications of our datasets, we have incorporated design factors that align\nwith the real-world applications of both HoK and other relevant scenarios.\nMulti-Difficulty\nIntuitively, the level of difficulty in the environment significantly impacts the performance of al-\ngorithms. However, previous researches only utilized one set of datasets with a uniform level of\ndifficulty in the environment, which is not appropriate for HoK, where the difficulty of the task can\nbe substantially affected by the level of opponents. Therefore, to examine the effects of varying levels\nof difficulty in the environment, we propose several multi-difficulty datasets with different difficulty\nlevels. Specifically, we develop two sets of datasets: norm and hard, which are categorized based\non the opponent’s level. Within each level, we propose four datasets according to diverse win rates\nagainst the opponent: poor, medium, expert and mixed. To elaborate, the poor\/medium\/expert dataset\nis generated by recording the battle trajectories of a relative lower\/equal\/higher level model compared\nto the opponent, and the mixed dataset is an equal mixture of the three datasets mentioned above.\nMulti-Task\nAs a MOBA game, HoK features a diverse cast of heroes with distinct roles and skillsets. While the\noverall objective remains consistent throughout matches, the selection of heroes can significantly\nalter the nature of the task at hand. Consequently, HoK presents multi-task challenge which requires\na single model to handle multiple tasks [51, 24, 50]. However, none of the current works provide\nuniform datasets for multi-task offline RL. To address this research gap, we propose a series of\nmulti-task datasets based on the multi-task nature of HoK and evaluate the multi-task learning ability\nof current offline RL and offline MARL algorithms. Specifically, we define a hero pool with several\nheroes and randomly select heroes from it to sample data. Depending on whether the selected heroes\nare on the controlled side or the opponent side, we sample either the multi_hero or the multi_oppo\ndataset. In cases where both sides choose random heroes, we sample the multi_hero_oppo dataset.\nFurthermore, as mentioned in the previous section, different levels of opponents naturally form\nmultiple tasks with varying environmental difficulties. Thus, we propose several level-based multi-\ntask datasets by sampling data with randomly selected opponent levels. According to different\ndifficulty levels, we have proposed two datasets, named norm_multi_level and hard_multi_level.\nGeneralization\nThe unique gameplay mechanics of HoK, characterized by a diverse cast of heroes with distinct\nroles and skillsets, lend themselves well to multi-task and serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating\nthe generality of models across a range of tasks. Building on the previous work [42] and taking\ninto account the realities of human combat in HoK, we have identified three key challenges for\ngeneralization: hero generalization, opponent generalization, and level generalization.\n6\nWe have developed six experiments: \"norm_general\" and \"hard_general\" for level generalization,\n\"norm_hero_general\" and \"hard_hero_general\" for hero generalization, and \"norm_oppo_general\"\nand \"hard_oppo_general\" for opponent generalization, for HoK1v1 and HoK3v3, respectively.\nAmong them, the first two experiments, \"norm_general\" and \"hard_general,\" have their corresponding\ndatasets, and we train models on these datasets. The latter four experiments do not require extra\ndatasets because we directly use the existing models that have already been trained using other\ndatasets. For more details on the design of generalization, please refer to the Appendix C.\nHeterogeneous Teammate\nHeterogeneous teammate is a crucial research direction in MARL [33, 17]. In the practical scenarios\nof HoK, the capacity of each player is generally different, making it naturally suitable for investigating\nthe challenges associated with heterogeneous teammate. In order to mimic real-world scenarios\nand facilitate research on heterogeneous teammate challenges, we design two datasets in HoK3v3:\nnorm_stupid_partner and norm_expert_partner. These datasets were collected in a standard manner,\nwith the exception that one random hero in each team is controlled by a model with a relatively\nlow\/high level of expertise, while the remaining heroes are controlled by the regular model.\nSub-Task\nAs introduced in Sec 4.2.3, we designed several practical and meaningful sub-tasks to provide diverse\nscenarios based on HoK. Based on these sub-tasks, we proposed diverse datasets to support Offline\nRL research similar to the design of previous studies [6, 12].\nTable 1: Details of datasets in HoK1v1 game mode\nFactors\nDatasets\/Experiments\nCapacity\nHeroes\nOppo_heroes\nWin_rate\nLevels\nMulti-Difficulty\nnorm_poor\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n12%\n1\nnorm_medium\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n50%\n1\nnorm_expert\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n88%\n1\nnorm_mixed\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n50%\n1\nhard_poor\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n6%\n5\nhard_medium\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n50%\n5\nhard_expert\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n84%\n5\nhard_mixed\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n45%\n5\nGeneralization\nhard_general\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n90%\n5\nnorm_general\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n46%\n1\nnorm_hero_general\n-\nmulti_hero\ndefault\n-\n1\nhard_hero_general\n-\nmulti_hero\ndefault\n-\n5\nnorm_oppo_general\n-\ndefault\nmulti_hero\n-\n1\nhard_oppo_general\n-\ndefault\nmulti_hero\n-\n5\nMulti-Task\nnorm_multi_level\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n50%\n1\nhard_multi_level\n1000\ndefault\ndefault\n50%\n5\nnorm_multi_hero\n1000\nmulti_hero\ndefault\n23%\n1\nnorm_multi_oppo\n1000\ndefault\nmulti_hero\n77%\n1\nnorm_multi_hero_oppo\n1000\nmulti_hero\nmulti_hero\n50%\n1\n4.3.1\nDatasets Details\nTable 1, Table 2 and Table 3presents the details of our proposed datasets. All the datasets are sampled\nusing checkpoints with different levels as introduced in Sec. 4.1.1. Typically, each dataset consists of\n1000 trajectories, except for the sub-task datasets, which contain 100 trajectories. The default heroes\nchosen for both camps are luban with Summoner Spells set to frenzy in HoK1v1 and {{zhaoyun},\n{diaochan}, {liyuanfang}} with Summoner Spells assigned as {{smite}, {purify}, {purify}} based\non their respective roles in HoK3v3. However, in specific scenarios such as Generalization or\nMulti-Task settings, we employ a random selection of heroes from a predefined set, multi_hero. For\nthe HoK1v1 mode, the set comprises five heroes, {luban, direnjie, houyi, makeboluo, gongsunli}.\nIn HoK3v3, the set consists six heroes, with two heroes assigned to each role, namely {{zhaoyun,\nzhongwuyan}, {diaochan, zhugeliang}, {liyuanfang, sunshangxiang}}. The win rate of the behavior\npolicy is recorded in the column labeled Win_rate for reference. The column labeled Levels denotes\nthe levels of opponents used for evaluation.

Besides,\nwe fully validate and compare these baselines on our datasets. The results are presented in the form of\ntest winning rate. Each algorithm is run for three random seeds, and we report the mean performance\nwith standard deviation. The performance of behaviour policies is presented in Appendix C. Details\nof the implementations and experimental results can be referenced in Appendix G.\n5.1\nBaselines\n5.1.1\nHoK1v1\nThe Offline RL baseline algorithms we implement are briefly introduced below: BC: Behavior\ncloning. TD3+BC [7]: One of the state-of-the-art single agent offline algorithm, simply adding the\nBC term to TD3 [8]. CQL [19]: Conservative Q-Learning conducts conservative value iteration by\nadding a regularizer to the critic loss. IQL [16]: Implicit Q-Learning leverages upper expectile value\nfunction to learn Q-function and extracts policy via advantage-weighted behavioral cloning.\nThe structured action space in HoK is similar to the joint action space in multi-agent settings, which\ninspires us to resort to the design in MARL methods. We propose a novel baseline algorithm, named\nQMIX+CQL. Specifically, we import QMIX algorithm from the MARL literature [30] to tackle the\nstructured action space by regarding each head of the action space as a single agent and incorporate\nCQL regularizer term into local Q-funtion in QMIX for offline learning.\n8\n5.1.2\nHoK3v3\nThe Offline MARL baseline algorithms are briefly introduced below: IND+BC: Behavior cloning\nwith independent learning paradigm. IND+CQL: Adopts an independent learning paradigm for\nmulti-agent settings, using conservative Q-learning [19]. COMM+CQL: Incorporate inter-agent\ncommunication based on IND+CQL. IND+ICQ [47]: Implicit Constraint Q-learning with inde-\npendent learning paradigm, which only uses insample data for value estimation to alleviate the\nextrapolation error. MAICQ [47]: Multi-agent version of implicit constraint Q-learning by decom-\nposed multi-agent joint-policy under implicit constraint with CTDE paradigm. OMAR [29]: Using\nzeroth-order optimization for better coordination among agents’ policies, based on independent CQL.\n5.2\nBenchmark Results\nWe have validated the offline RL and offline MARL baselines on our datasets and aggregated the\nresults in Table 4 and Table 5.\nTable 4: Averaged test winning rate or normalized score (Sub-Task) of baselines in HoK1v1 game\nmode.\nFactors\nDatasets\nBC\nCQL\nQMIX+CQL\nIQL\nTD3+BC\nMulti-Difficulty\nnorm_poor\n0.08±0.02\n0.06±0.01\n0.08±0.02\n0.07±0.01\n0.0±0.0\nnorm_medium\n0.33±0.01\n0.32±0.01\n0.31±0.03\n0.32±0.01\n0.01±0.01\nnorm_expert\n0.64±0.01\n0.58±0.03\n0.67±0.01\n0.62±0.02\n0.03±0.01\nnorm_mixed\n0.17±0.01\n0.23±0.04\n0.20±0.01\n0.25±0.01\n0.01±0.01\nhard_poor\n0.01±0.01\n0.01±0.01\n0.01±0.01\n0.01±0.00\n0.00±0.00\nhard_medium\n0.13±0.01\n0.11±0.01\n0.20±0.01\n0.12±0.02\n0.00±0.00\nhard_expert\n0.33±0.01\n0.30±0.01\n0.44±0.05\n0.34±0.04\n0.00±0.00\nhard_mixed\n0.05±0.3\n0.02±0.01\n0.08±0.01\n0.06±0.01\n0.01±0.01\nGeneralization\nnorm_general\n0.19±0.01\n0.20±0.04\n0.32±0.03\n0.18±0.01\n0.02±0.02\nhard_general\n0.04±0.01\n0.03±0.01\n0.08±0.02\n0.02±0.01\n0.00±0.00\nnorm_hero_general\n0.06±0.01\n0.06±0.01\n0.08±0.01\n0.07±0.01\n0.00±0.00\nhard_hero_general\n0.03±0.01\n0.03±0.01\n0.04±0.01\n0.06±0.01\n0.00±0.00\nnorm_oppo_general\n0.58±0.03\n0.52±0.04\n0.42±0.22\n0.51±0.07\n0.12±0.01\nhard_oppo_general\n0.15±0.02\n0.12±0.03\n0.23±0.04\n0.14±0.03\n0.01±0.01\nMulti-Task\nnorm_multi_level\n0.32±0.03\n0.25±0.03\n0.41±0.02\n0.30±0.02\n0.02±0.01\nhard_multi_level\n0.08±0.02\n0.06±0.01\n0.16±0.03\n0.08±0.02\n0.00±0.00\nnorm_multi_hero\n0.08±0.01\n0.07±0.02\n0.11±0.01\n0.06±0.01\n0.00±0.00\nnorm_multi_oppo\n0.59±0.02\n0.55±0.03\n0.65±0.02\n0.60±0.05\n0.10±0.02\nnorm_multi_hero_oppo\n0.26±0.01\n0.21±0.02\n0.32±0.03\n0.28±0.05\n0.03±0.01\nSub-Task\ndestroy_turret_medium\n0.61±0.06\n0.63±0.01\n0.61±0.03\n0.60±0.02\n0.67±0.03\ndestroy_turret_expert\n0.94±0.02\n0.94±0.02\n0.92±0.05\n0.95±0.01\n0.57±0.13\ndestroy_turret_mixed\n0.88±0.04\n0.87±0.03\n0.89±0.02\n0.89±0.04\n0.82±0.03\n• Baselines Comparison: As indicated in Table 4, QMIX+CQL exhibits superior performance in\ncomparison to other approaches, implying that the integration of MARL methods may be a suitable\nchoice for environments with a structured action space.

INTRODUCTION\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has become increasingly pop-\nular in the gaming industry as it offers a promising way of\ncreating immersive gaming experiences. From training AI-\ncontrolled non-player characters [1, 2] to automated game\ntesting [3, 4].\nHowever the widespread use of RL is often limited by\nits sample complexity which makes training in complex en-\nvironments, such as modern AAA games, slow and ineffi-\ncient. Offline RL (ORL) has recently garnered interest as a\nframework aimed at improving the sample efficiency of RL\nagents [5]. With ORL, one can completely eliminate the need\nfor interaction with the environment and instead rely on a\npreviously collected dataset of experiences. Such datasets can\nbe made readily accessible to game developers; for instance,\nthey could use samples obtained from playtesting sessions or\ndata extracted from previously released games.\nIn this paper we introduce OfflineMania a novel game\nenvironment for Online RL and ORL, centered around a\nsingle-agent racing game inspired by the iconic TrackMa-\nnia [6] game series. Our environment, built using the Unity\n3D game engine [7], provides a track in which the agent\nmust complete the race through optimal navigation. Moreover,\nwe provide datasets of agent experiences tailored specifically\nfor benchmarking ORL techniques. These datasets are of\nvarying quality, ranging from those generated using random\nFig. 1. Visualization of OfflineMania, highlighting the track centerline used\nin the reward function, the episode starting area, the agent, and the positive\npart of the reward during a transition.\npolicies to those crafted by expert agents. We additionally offer\nsmaller and mixed versions of these datasets. These variants\nare designed to test algorithmic performance under complex\nscenarios that challenge the robustness of learning methods.\nOur work focuses on providing a gaming testbed environment\nand multiple datasets tailored for game AI research in ORL.\nTo the best of our knowledge such a combination is not\ncurrently available in the existing literature. We further provide\na study assessing the performance of different Online RL and\nORL algorithms using our new datasets. We also investigate\nthe performance of fine-tuning policies trained offline using\nOnline RL. This last framework is a more natural approach in\ngame development, as it allows developers to take advantage of\ndatasets to create a policy that then can be effectively improved\nwith fewer game interactions.\nThe key contributions of this work are:\n• we introduce OfflineMania, a new environment inspired\nby TrackMania developed using the Unity 3D engine;\n• we provide diverse datasets of varying sizes, collected\nusing policies of different expertise levels; and\n• we present results for a variety of baseline algorithms\nincluding both Online and ORL approaches, as well as\nhybrid methods that combine Offline training with Online\nfine-tuning.\nII. RELATED WORK\nOffline Reinforcement Learning (ORL).\nOffline Rein-\nforcement Learning is a promising way to address the sample\n979-8-3503-5067-8\/24\/$31.00 ©2024 IEEE\narXiv:2407.09415v1  [cs.AI]  12 Jul 2024\ncomplexity challenges faced by Online RL. The core objective\nof ORL is to create a robust policy from a fixed dataset of pre-\ncollected environment transitions, without requiring further\nonline interactions with the environment [8, 9, 10]. ORL has\nemerged as a promising approach to training game agents [11].\nModern AAA games are often computationally demanding,\nslow to simulate, and inherently unstable, all of which lead to\nincreased need for extensive interactions with the environment.\nORL has significantly benefited from the development of\nbenchmarks like D4RL [12], which provides a wide range of\ndatasets across various domains such as locomotion, robotic\nmanipulation, and vision-based autonomous driving. However,\nto the best of our knowledge, there is no ORL dataset available\nin the literature specifically tailored for studying these tech-\nniques in gaming environments, particularly in the context of\nracing games. This paper aims to bridge this gap.\nOffline to Online RL.\nThe Offline to Online approach\nfocuses on how to effectively improve policies trained with\nORL in a online setting which allows further environment\ninteractions. It is a promising approach for training game\nagents [13] since a game in development can change on\na daily basis, potentially rendering the datasets collected\nin an environment iteration insufficient for subsequent it-\nerations. Offline to Online RL can allow game developers\nto seamlessly transition to new environment with minimal\nonline interactions. However, this transition poses significant\nchallenges [14, 15], including dealing with distribution shifts\nbetween the offline data and the new online interactions. For\nthese reasons, with this paper we aim to provide a benchmark\nsuite for investigating the impact of Offline to Online training\nin gaming environments.\nIII. ENVIRONMENT AND DATASETS\nA. Environment\nWe developed OfflineMania, shown in Figure 1, using the\nUnity 3D game engine leveraging the ML-Agents package [7].\nIt features a Gymnasium-compatible interface [16], ensuring\nstraightforward integration into existing experimental setups.\nThe game is computationally efficient, with the game speed\neasily adjustable to speed up online training process. Addition-\nally, the environment supports rendering capabilities, offering\na birds-eye view of the car. This visualization facilitates\nqualitative assessment of agent behavior and simplifies the\nevaluation process.\nWe now describe the main elements of the environment: the\nstate and action-space, the reward function, and episode loop.\nState Space.\nThe state space is a vector in R33. It is\ncomposed by 15 raycasts covering a 180-degree field of view\nin front of the car, with each ray are associated two values:\none indicating the presence of an object within its path,\nand the other specifying the distance to the detected object.\nAdditionally, the components of the velocity of the car are\nincluded as part of the state representation.\nAction Space.\nThe agent action space consists of two\ncontinuous values. The first value controls the steering angle\nof the car which ranges from -1 (indicating a left turn) to 1\n(indicating a right turn). The second value controls the accel-\neration or braking of the car, with a value of 1 corresponding\nto full acceleration and a value of -1 representing braking or\nreversing when the car is stationary.\nReward Signal.\nOur reward function draws inspiration from\nprior work [2]. We denote with pt the position of the car\nprojected onto the track centerline at timestep t, and by pbest\nthe most advanced position achieved thus far in the episode.\nOur reward is then:\nrt = rprog\nt\n−\n(\nλ ∥vcar ∥\nif in contact with wall\n0\notherwise\n,\n(1)\nwhere rprog\nt\nquantifies the progress of position pt along the\ncenterline relative to pbest, as shown in Figure 1. We set rprog\nt\nto 0 if pt does not advance beyond pbest. vcar is the magnitude\nof the velocity at the moment of impact, and λ is a fixed\ncoefficient penalizing collisions. In our environment, λ = 50.\nEpisode.\nDuring each episode the vehicle starts with its\nposition dynamically chosen within a designated square area\nbefore the fist turn in the track. We also randomize the\norientation of the car, between -30 and 30 degrees from the\ncenterline, which ensures that it is always facing the correct\ndirection. Every episode has a fixed length of 2,000 steps. In\nthis many steps an expert agent can complete at most 5 laps.\nB. Datasets\nIn order to support comprehensive research in ORL, we\ngenerated a diverse series datasets. First, we train three dis-\ntinct policies using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [17],\nstopping the training after 1,000, 5,000, and 12,500 network\nupdates, respectively. Each of the trained policy represents\nvarying degrees of ability in navigating the race track. The\npolicies obtain mean cumulative reward of -360, 327, and\n1183 respectively, over five episodes. The first policy struggles\nwith the initial corner. The second policy, while capable\nof occasionally completing the track, exhibits inconsistent\nperformance. In contrast, the third policy consistently achieved\nhigh performance by efficiently navigating the track, including\ncorner-cutting strategies, successfully completing 5 laps in\neach episode.\nUsing these three policies, we collected three distinct\ndatasets: basic, medium, and expert, each consisting of\n100,000 transitions. Additionally, we created mixed datasets,\none consisting of 200,000 transitions in total and another\nof only 5,000. We refer to these datasets with mix large\nand mix small, respectively. The mixed datasets consist of\n90% transitions sampled from the basic policy, 7% from the\nmedium policy, and only 3% from the expert policy. The\ndistribution of transitions in the mixed datasets was chosen\nto simulate a complex scenario in which ORL algorithms\nmust stitch together different behaviors in order to correctly\nlearn an optimal policy. The smaller version of the mixed\ndataset is useful to understand the behavior of ORL approaches\nwhen dealing with small datasets. Following this idea, we built\nanother datasets from only 5,000 transitions collected exclu-\nsively from the basic policy, called basic small. Those two\nvariants – mix small and basic small – offer a more demanding\ntestbed for evaluating the robustness and adaptability of ORL\nalgorithms under complex training conditions.\nIV. BENCHMARK STUDY\nOfflineMania aims to be a testbed for developing new\ntraining techniques. We provide results of a set of baselines for\nwidely recognized methods for Online RL, ORL, and Offline\nto Online RL. For all approaches we present the mean results\nover five different seeds. All experiments were conducted\nusing a system equipped with a Nvidia RTX 2070 and an\nAMD Ryzen 3600X processor.\nFor Online RL baselines, we opted for two state-of-the-\nart methods: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [17] and\nSoft Actor Critic (SAC) [18]. PPO, known for its efficacy and\nrobustness to hyperparameter selection, represents a widely\nused policy-based approach. Similarly, we selected SAC, an\nactor-critic algorithm, for its efficiency and for its importance\nin the RL landscape. We trained our PPO agent over 12,500\nnetwork updates, for a total of 15 million environment interac-\ntions and approximately 10 hours of training time. In contrast,\ntraining with SAC spanned 3 million network updates, with\nan equivalent number of environment interactions, totaling\napproximately 20 hours of training time.\nFor ORL approaches, we chose Conservative Q-Learning\n(CQL) [10], Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradi-\nent with Behavioral cloning (TD3BC) [9], and Implicit Q-\nLearning (IQL) [8]. For all algorithms we present results after\n300,000 network updates, corresponding to about one hour of\ntraining time for all algorithms.\nFor Offline to Online approaches, we compare various\nmethods. These include: an approach combining TD3BC [9]\nfor offline training and TD3 [19] for online fine tuning;\nIQL [8], following the fine-tuning process outlined in the orig-\ninal paper; Jump Start Reinforcement Learning (JSRL) [20],\nwhich utilizes offline policies as guides for online training;\nPolicy EXpainsion (PEX) [21], a method combining offline\npolicies with online training to enhance exploration; and the\nwork of Macaluso et al. [22] that we will refer as SDBG,\ndesigned specifically for small offline datasets, utilizing a\nworld model based augmentation to improve offline training.\nFor each approach we present results after 300,000 offline\nnetwork updates and 1 million online fine-tuning updates, for\na total of about 4 hours of training across all algorithms. Since\nPEX, SDGB, and JSRL are agnostic to the algorithm used, we\ndecided to show results using IQL.\nA. Online RL Results\nWe use online RL for training a policy from scratch with\nenvironment interactions. The resulting mean reward achieved\nby PPO at the end of the training was 1183, indicative of\nconsistent high-quality behaviors on the track. The policy is\nproficient at navigating the track, and is also able to cut corners\neffectively. It can complete a lap in 385 steps, for a total of 5\nTABLE I\nAVERAGE REWARDS OF OFFLINE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING TRAINING\nAFTER 300,000 NETWORK UPDATES.\nMethods\nTD3BC\nCQL\nIQL\nExpert\n-3981±57\n-3325±1353\n1192±1\nMedium\n335±87\n-4227±571\n789±58\nBasic\n12±9\n39±81\n98±38\nMix Large\n219±96\n-4080±873\n828±38\nMix Small\n-1125±154\n-3972±858\n10±32\nBasic Small\n64±31\n-3488±626\n20±102\nlaps in a single episode. PPO succeeds at the cost of a large\nnumber of environment interactions (about 15 million).\nConversely, despite training for 20 hours and 3 million\nenvironment interactions, the SAC outcomes are considerably\nless promising. The SAC policy achieves a total mean re-\nward of only 215 and demonstrates suboptimal performance\ncharacterized by slower and less stable navigation of the\ntrack compared to the PPO-trained policy. This highlights the\nlimitations of SAC, despite its better sample efficiency, in\nproducing effective policies even after extensive training.\nThese results quantify the efficacy of Online RL approaches.\nHowever, they also highlight the challenges posed by the slow\ntraining speed and significant sample inefficiency.\nB. Offline RL Results\nIn Table I we present the results for ORL baselines on\nthe datasets described in Section III-B. For all algorithms the\ntraining time for 300,000 network updates was under one hour.\nRemarkably, IQL consistently outperforms TD3BC and CQL\nacross nearly all datasets. Of particular note is the ability of\nIQL to learn policies from the expert dataset that even surpass\nthe performance of the policy used to generate it. On all other\ndatasets, IQL produces policies that are capable of navigating\nthe track without major collisions.\nConversely, TD3BC and CQL unexpectedly fall short on\nall datasets, most notably on the expert dataset. This may be\nattributed to sensitivity to the hyperparameters that is a well\nknown problem in ORL [5].\nC. Offline to Online RL Results\nIn this section we report baseline performance for the\ncombination of ORL pre-training and Online RL fine-tuning.\nSuch approaches are useful when an offline policy fails to meet\ndeployment standards. In these cases, we would like to im-\nprove the offline-trained policy by allowing some interactions\nwith the environment, while still minimizing such interactions.\nWhile this process might appear straightforward, it is\ncomplex primarily due to the distributional shift problem.\nDistributional shift occurs during the first training iterations\nwhen moving to online training, as the agent navigates into\nunexplored state-action spaces. In this setting the values of\nthe Q-function trained during the offline phase may become\nhighly inaccurate. This inaccuracy can lead to incorrect policy\nevaluations and arbitrary policy updates in these unseen states,\nwhich undermines the policy learned through ORL [15].\nTABLE II\nAVERAGE REWARDS FOR OFFLINE-TO-ONLINE APPROACHES AFTER 300,000 OFFLINE NETWORK UPDATES AND 1 MILLION ONLINE UPDATES.\nMethods\nTD3BC+TD3\nIQL\nSDBG-IQL\nPEX-IQL\nJSRL-IQL\nExpert\n15±11\n1192±4\n1199±3\n-2425±2132\n1193±1\nMedium\n-497±773\n856±58\n852±12\n776±39\n856±1\nBasic\n11±7\n71±13\n130±35\n-173±504\n99±33\nMix Large\n-2538±1170\n932±50\n1152±12\n671±175\n1142±2\nMix Small\n-3886±923\n-614±882\n340±187\n-2147±1561\n-826±86\nBasic Small\n-4352±1425\n3±33\n105±3\n-2200±2042\n152±1\nIn Table II we present the results of the experiments in this\nsetup.

INTRODUCTION\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has become increasingly pop-\nular in the gaming industry as it offers a promising way of\ncreating immersive gaming experiences. From training AI-\ncontrolled non-player characters [1, 2] to automated game\ntesting [3, 4].\nHowever the widespread use of RL is often limited by\nits sample complexity which makes training in complex en-\nvironments, such as modern AAA games, slow and ineffi-\ncient. Offline RL (ORL) has recently garnered interest as a\nframework aimed at improving the sample efficiency of RL\nagents [5]. With ORL, one can completely eliminate the need\nfor interaction with the environment and instead rely on a\npreviously collected dataset of experiences. Such datasets can\nbe made readily accessible to game developers; for instance,\nthey could use samples obtained from playtesting sessions or\ndata extracted from previously released games.\nIn this paper we introduce OfflineMania a novel game\nenvironment for Online RL and ORL, centered around a\nsingle-agent racing game inspired by the iconic TrackMa-\nnia [6] game series. Our environment, built using the Unity\n3D game engine [7], provides a track in which the agent\nmust complete the race through optimal navigation. Moreover,\nwe provide datasets of agent experiences tailored specifically\nfor benchmarking ORL techniques. These datasets are of\nvarying quality, ranging from those generated using random\nFig. 1. Visualization of OfflineMania, highlighting the track centerline used\nin the reward function, the episode starting area, the agent, and the positive\npart of the reward during a transition.\npolicies to those crafted by expert agents. We additionally offer\nsmaller and mixed versions of these datasets. These variants\nare designed to test algorithmic performance under complex\nscenarios that challenge the robustness of learning methods.\nOur work focuses on providing a gaming testbed environment\nand multiple datasets tailored for game AI research in ORL.\nTo the best of our knowledge such a combination is not\ncurrently available in the existing literature. We further provide\na study assessing the performance of different Online RL and\nORL algorithms using our new datasets. We also investigate\nthe performance of fine-tuning policies trained offline using\nOnline RL. This last framework is a more natural approach in\ngame development, as it allows developers to take advantage of\ndatasets to create a policy that then can be effectively improved\nwith fewer game interactions.\nThe key contributions of this work are:\n• we introduce OfflineMania, a new environment inspired\nby TrackMania developed using the Unity 3D engine;\n• we provide diverse datasets of varying sizes, collected\nusing policies of different expertise levels; and\n• we present results for a variety of baseline algorithms\nincluding both Online and ORL approaches, as well as\nhybrid methods that combine Offline training with Online\nfine-tuning.\nII. RELATED WORK\nOffline Reinforcement Learning (ORL).\nOffline Rein-\nforcement Learning is a promising way to address the sample\n979-8-3503-5067-8\/24\/$31.00 ©2024 IEEE\narXiv:2407.09415v1  [cs.AI]  12 Jul 2024\ncomplexity challenges faced by Online RL. The core objective\nof ORL is to create a robust policy from a fixed dataset of pre-\ncollected environment transitions, without requiring further\nonline interactions with the environment [8, 9, 10]. ORL has\nemerged as a promising approach to training game agents [11].\nModern AAA games are often computationally demanding,\nslow to simulate, and inherently unstable, all of which lead to\nincreased need for extensive interactions with the environment.\nORL has significantly benefited from the development of\nbenchmarks like D4RL [12], which provides a wide range of\ndatasets across various domains such as locomotion, robotic\nmanipulation, and vision-based autonomous driving. However,\nto the best of our knowledge, there is no ORL dataset available\nin the literature specifically tailored for studying these tech-\nniques in gaming environments, particularly in the context of\nracing games. This paper aims to bridge this gap.\nOffline to Online RL.\nThe Offline to Online approach\nfocuses on how to effectively improve policies trained with\nORL in a online setting which allows further environment\ninteractions. It is a promising approach for training game\nagents [13] since a game in development can change on\na daily basis, potentially rendering the datasets collected\nin an environment iteration insufficient for subsequent it-\nerations. Offline to Online RL can allow game developers\nto seamlessly transition to new environment with minimal\nonline interactions. However, this transition poses significant\nchallenges [14, 15], including dealing with distribution shifts\nbetween the offline data and the new online interactions. For\nthese reasons, with this paper we aim to provide a benchmark\nsuite for investigating the impact of Offline to Online training\nin gaming environments.\nIII. ENVIRONMENT AND DATASETS\nA. Environment\nWe developed OfflineMania, shown in Figure 1, using the\nUnity 3D game engine leveraging the ML-Agents package [7].\nIt features a Gymnasium-compatible interface [16], ensuring\nstraightforward integration into existing experimental setups.\nThe game is computationally efficient, with the game speed\neasily adjustable to speed up online training process. Addition-\nally, the environment supports rendering capabilities, offering\na birds-eye view of the car. This visualization facilitates\nqualitative assessment of agent behavior and simplifies the\nevaluation process.\nWe now describe the main elements of the environment: the\nstate and action-space, the reward function, and episode loop.\nState Space.\nThe state space is a vector in R33. It is\ncomposed by 15 raycasts covering a 180-degree field of view\nin front of the car, with each ray are associated two values:\none indicating the presence of an object within its path,\nand the other specifying the distance to the detected object.\nAdditionally, the components of the velocity of the car are\nincluded as part of the state representation.\nAction Space.\nThe agent action space consists of two\ncontinuous values. The first value controls the steering angle\nof the car which ranges from -1 (indicating a left turn) to 1\n(indicating a right turn). The second value controls the accel-\neration or braking of the car, with a value of 1 corresponding\nto full acceleration and a value of -1 representing braking or\nreversing when the car is stationary.\nReward Signal.\nOur reward function draws inspiration from\nprior work [2]. We denote with pt the position of the car\nprojected onto the track centerline at timestep t, and by pbest\nthe most advanced position achieved thus far in the episode.\nOur reward is then:\nrt = rprog\nt\n−\n(\nλ ∥vcar ∥\nif in contact with wall\n0\notherwise\n,\n(1)\nwhere rprog\nt\nquantifies the progress of position pt along the\ncenterline relative to pbest, as shown in Figure 1. We set rprog\nt\nto 0 if pt does not advance beyond pbest. vcar is the magnitude\nof the velocity at the moment of impact, and λ is a fixed\ncoefficient penalizing collisions. In our environment, λ = 50.\nEpisode.\nDuring each episode the vehicle starts with its\nposition dynamically chosen within a designated square area\nbefore the fist turn in the track. We also randomize the\norientation of the car, between -30 and 30 degrees from the\ncenterline, which ensures that it is always facing the correct\ndirection. Every episode has a fixed length of 2,000 steps. In\nthis many steps an expert agent can complete at most 5 laps.\nB. Datasets\nIn order to support comprehensive research in ORL, we\ngenerated a diverse series datasets. First, we train three dis-\ntinct policies using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [17],\nstopping the training after 1,000, 5,000, and 12,500 network\nupdates, respectively. Each of the trained policy represents\nvarying degrees of ability in navigating the race track. The\npolicies obtain mean cumulative reward of -360, 327, and\n1183 respectively, over five episodes. The first policy struggles\nwith the initial corner. The second policy, while capable\nof occasionally completing the track, exhibits inconsistent\nperformance. In contrast, the third policy consistently achieved\nhigh performance by efficiently navigating the track, including\ncorner-cutting strategies, successfully completing 5 laps in\neach episode.\nUsing these three policies, we collected three distinct\ndatasets: basic, medium, and expert, each consisting of\n100,000 transitions. Additionally, we created mixed datasets,\none consisting of 200,000 transitions in total and another\nof only 5,000. We refer to these datasets with mix large\nand mix small, respectively. The mixed datasets consist of\n90% transitions sampled from the basic policy, 7% from the\nmedium policy, and only 3% from the expert policy. The\ndistribution of transitions in the mixed datasets was chosen\nto simulate a complex scenario in which ORL algorithms\nmust stitch together different behaviors in order to correctly\nlearn an optimal policy. The smaller version of the mixed\ndataset is useful to understand the behavior of ORL approaches\nwhen dealing with small datasets. Following this idea, we built\nanother datasets from only 5,000 transitions collected exclu-\nsively from the basic policy, called basic small. Those two\nvariants – mix small and basic small – offer a more demanding\ntestbed for evaluating the robustness and adaptability of ORL\nalgorithms under complex training conditions.\nIV. BENCHMARK STUDY\nOfflineMania aims to be a testbed for developing new\ntraining techniques. We provide results of a set of baselines for\nwidely recognized methods for Online RL, ORL, and Offline\nto Online RL. For all approaches we present the mean results\nover five different seeds. All experiments were conducted\nusing a system equipped with a Nvidia RTX 2070 and an\nAMD Ryzen 3600X processor.\nFor Online RL baselines, we opted for two state-of-the-\nart methods: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [17] and\nSoft Actor Critic (SAC) [18]. PPO, known for its efficacy and\nrobustness to hyperparameter selection, represents a widely\nused policy-based approach. Similarly, we selected SAC, an\nactor-critic algorithm, for its efficiency and for its importance\nin the RL landscape. We trained our PPO agent over 12,500\nnetwork updates, for a total of 15 million environment interac-\ntions and approximately 10 hours of training time. In contrast,\ntraining with SAC spanned 3 million network updates, with\nan equivalent number of environment interactions, totaling\napproximately 20 hours of training time.\nFor ORL approaches, we chose Conservative Q-Learning\n(CQL) [10], Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradi-\nent with Behavioral cloning (TD3BC) [9], and Implicit Q-\nLearning (IQL) [8]. For all algorithms we present results after\n300,000 network updates, corresponding to about one hour of\ntraining time for all algorithms.\nFor Offline to Online approaches, we compare various\nmethods. These include: an approach combining TD3BC [9]\nfor offline training and TD3 [19] for online fine tuning;\nIQL [8], following the fine-tuning process outlined in the orig-\ninal paper; Jump Start Reinforcement Learning (JSRL) [20],\nwhich utilizes offline policies as guides for online training;\nPolicy EXpainsion (PEX) [21], a method combining offline\npolicies with online training to enhance exploration; and the\nwork of Macaluso et al. [22] that we will refer as SDBG,\ndesigned specifically for small offline datasets, utilizing a\nworld model based augmentation to improve offline training.\nFor each approach we present results after 300,000 offline\nnetwork updates and 1 million online fine-tuning updates, for\na total of about 4 hours of training across all algorithms. Since\nPEX, SDGB, and JSRL are agnostic to the algorithm used, we\ndecided to show results using IQL.\nA. Online RL Results\nWe use online RL for training a policy from scratch with\nenvironment interactions. The resulting mean reward achieved\nby PPO at the end of the training was 1183, indicative of\nconsistent high-quality behaviors on the track. The policy is\nproficient at navigating the track, and is also able to cut corners\neffectively. It can complete a lap in 385 steps, for a total of 5\nTABLE I\nAVERAGE REWARDS OF OFFLINE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING TRAINING\nAFTER 300,000 NETWORK UPDATES.\nMethods\nTD3BC\nCQL\nIQL\nExpert\n-3981±57\n-3325±1353\n1192±1\nMedium\n335±87\n-4227±571\n789±58\nBasic\n12±9\n39±81\n98±38\nMix Large\n219±96\n-4080±873\n828±38\nMix Small\n-1125±154\n-3972±858\n10±32\nBasic Small\n64±31\n-3488±626\n20±102\nlaps in a single episode. PPO succeeds at the cost of a large\nnumber of environment interactions (about 15 million).\nConversely, despite training for 20 hours and 3 million\nenvironment interactions, the SAC outcomes are considerably\nless promising. The SAC policy achieves a total mean re-\nward of only 215 and demonstrates suboptimal performance\ncharacterized by slower and less stable navigation of the\ntrack compared to the PPO-trained policy. This highlights the\nlimitations of SAC, despite its better sample efficiency, in\nproducing effective policies even after extensive training.\nThese results quantify the efficacy of Online RL approaches.\nHowever, they also highlight the challenges posed by the slow\ntraining speed and significant sample inefficiency.\nB. Offline RL Results\nIn Table I we present the results for ORL baselines on\nthe datasets described in Section III-B. For all algorithms the\ntraining time for 300,000 network updates was under one hour.\nRemarkably, IQL consistently outperforms TD3BC and CQL\nacross nearly all datasets. Of particular note is the ability of\nIQL to learn policies from the expert dataset that even surpass\nthe performance of the policy used to generate it. On all other\ndatasets, IQL produces policies that are capable of navigating\nthe track without major collisions.\nConversely, TD3BC and CQL unexpectedly fall short on\nall datasets, most notably on the expert dataset. This may be\nattributed to sensitivity to the hyperparameters that is a well\nknown problem in ORL [5].\nC. Offline to Online RL Results\nIn this section we report baseline performance for the\ncombination of ORL pre-training and Online RL fine-tuning.\nSuch approaches are useful when an offline policy fails to meet\ndeployment standards. In these cases, we would like to im-\nprove the offline-trained policy by allowing some interactions\nwith the environment, while still minimizing such interactions.\nWhile this process might appear straightforward, it is\ncomplex primarily due to the distributional shift problem.\nDistributional shift occurs during the first training iterations\nwhen moving to online training, as the agent navigates into\nunexplored state-action spaces. In this setting the values of\nthe Q-function trained during the offline phase may become\nhighly inaccurate. This inaccuracy can lead to incorrect policy\nevaluations and arbitrary policy updates in these unseen states,\nwhich undermines the policy learned through ORL [15].\nTABLE II\nAVERAGE REWARDS FOR OFFLINE-TO-ONLINE APPROACHES AFTER 300,000 OFFLINE NETWORK UPDATES AND 1 MILLION ONLINE UPDATES.\nMethods\nTD3BC+TD3\nIQL\nSDBG-IQL\nPEX-IQL\nJSRL-IQL\nExpert\n15±11\n1192±4\n1199±3\n-2425±2132\n1193±1\nMedium\n-497±773\n856±58\n852±12\n776±39\n856±1\nBasic\n11±7\n71±13\n130±35\n-173±504\n99±33\nMix Large\n-2538±1170\n932±50\n1152±12\n671±175\n1142±2\nMix Small\n-3886±923\n-614±882\n340±187\n-2147±1561\n-826±86\nBasic Small\n-4352±1425\n3±33\n105±3\n-2200±2042\n152±1\nIn Table II we present the results of the experiments in this\nsetup. The combination of TD3BC and TD3 fails to improve\nthe offline policy and achieves worse performances on all\ndatasets. This might be due to the distributional shift problem\nwhich is not explicitly addressed by this approach. On the\nother hand, IQL demonstrates good fine-tuning performance\nand improves its offline results in almost all datasets. Only\nfor the mix small dataset the score is substantially reduced.\nThis is probably due to the difficulty in learning with such a\nsmall dataset derived from different policies.\nAlthough PEX attempts to directly address the challenge of\ntraining an online policy after offline pre-training, it achieves\nthe worst performance – lower even than the standard fine-\ntuning process of IQL. On the other hand, SDBG and JSRL\nshow remarkable performance. Even though SDBG specifi-\ncally addresses training setups with small datasets – as seen\nin the mix small and basic small results from Table II – it is\nthe only algorithm that improves the offline performance in\nall tasks. JSRL achieves good performance across all tasks as\nwell, except again for the mix small dataset.\nV. DISCUSSION\nORL is a promising approach to fostering more widespread\nuse of RL in modern video games, however there is a lack\nof environments with datasets that can be used to test the\ncapabilities of ORL methods in challenging conditions. This\npaper introduces a novel game environment which serves as a\nbenchmark for ORL research. We provide datasets of varying\ndata quality and quantity which facilitates the simulation of\ncomplex training scenarios1. Additionally, we present results\nfrom state-of-the-art methods for Online RL, ORL, and hybrid\nOffline to Online RL approaches. This benchmark aims to\nfacilitate future investigation into the use of offline data in\ngaming environments. By leveraging offline datasets, we can\neffectively mitigate the challenges in applying RL techniques\nto modern games, thereby contributing the integration of RL\ninto modern game development workflows.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

To this end, we\nhave developed TextStarCraft II, a specialized environment for assessing LLMs in\nreal-time strategic scenarios within SC2. Addressing the limitations of traditional\nChain of Thought (CoT) methods, we introduce the Chain of Summarization (CoS)\nmethod, enhancing LLMs’ capabilities in rapid and effective decision-making.

StarCraft II (SC2), one of the world’s\nmost popular and challenging e-sports, exemplifies these demands through its dynamic gameplay.\nPlayers must manage resources, construct bases, and command armies while making quick decisions\nand adapting their long-term strategies to evolving battlefield conditions. The game’s layered\ngameplay spans economic management, military strategy, and tactical execution, making SC2 a\nvaluable model for AI research, particularly in reinforcement learning (RL). SC2’s complexity, real-\ntime nature, and the fact that it is considered one of the hardest games in the world pose significant\nchallenges for AI systems, requiring them to master various aspects of the game simultaneously.\nFurther details about StarCraft II can be found in the appendix A. Pioneering efforts, exemplified by\nDeepMind’s AlphaStar [24], have demonstrated significant advancements in this domain, showcasing\nAI’s growing proficiency in strategic gameplay. With the evolution of LLMs in areas like reasoning,\nplanning, and decision-making, these models have begun to show potential in tasks traditionally\ndominated by RL approaches. Benchmarks such as AGENTBENCH [15] have been instrumental in\nevaluating these capabilities in multi-turn, open-ended contexts. However, despite these developments,\n∗Corresponding to Haifeng Zhang⟨haifeng.zhang@ia.ac.cn⟩and Jun Wang ⟨jun.wang@cs.ucl.ac.uk⟩.\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).\narXiv:2312.11865v3  [cs.AI]  18 Jun 2024\na specific benchmark for assessing LLMs’ capabilities in real-time strategy decision-making and\nlong-term planning in environments like StarCraft II is conspicuously absent.\nTherefore, we have chosen SC2 as the benchmark for evaluating the real-time strategy decision-\nmaking and long-term planning capabilities of LLMs. Given the lack of language support in existing\nSC2 environments, we developed TextStarCraft II. Utilizing the python-sc2 framework, TextStarCraft\nII converts the complex gameplay dynamics of SC2 into an interactive, text-based format. The\npython-sc2 interface 2 is utilized to convert game data into text, enabling LLM agents to perform\nmacro-strategic actions through language commands. For micro-strategic actions, we implement\na rule-based approach akin to that used by OpenAI Five [2], employing predefined Python scripts.\nThis allows LLM agents to engage in competition against the game’s built-in AI, other LLM agents,\nand human players through the execution of these scripted actions. Addressing the challenges posed\nby the intricate decision-making process in SC2, we propose the Chain of Summarization(CoS)\nmethod. This approach enhances the capacity of LLM Agents in processing complex information and\nmaking strategic decisions by incorporating single-frame and multi-frame summarization modules,\neach aiding in understanding the immediate game state and processing sequential data for strategy\nformulation and decision-making.\nIn this study, we conduct a thorough exploration of LLMs’ application and effectiveness within\nSC2 via the TextStarCraft II environment. Our experimental framework includes assessing the CoS\nmethod, evaluating the performance of proprietary and fine-tuned open-source LLMs in TextStarCraft\nII, testing real-time human-computer interaction, and using StarCraft II-themed question-answering\ntasks evaluated by human experts. We also analyze the impact of varying prompts on LLMs, their\nstrategic preferences, and the interpretability of their decision-making processes.\nOur contributions are manifold:\n• TextStarCraft II Development: We present TextStarCraft II, a novel environment that not\nonly enables the evaluation of LLMs in strategic gaming contexts but also supports real-time\nhuman-computer interactions.\n• Chain of Summarization Method and Agent: By introducing the CoS method and\nreleasing an open-source agent, we offer a powerful example and a high-level interface for\nthe community, fostering further development and interaction with TextStarCraft II.\n• Diverse Evaluations of LLMs: Our extensive evaluations encompass testing LLMs against\nthe game’s built-in AI, assessing their understanding of StarCraft II through human expert\nreviews, and conducting human-AI matches. These diverse methodologies underscore LLMs’\nproficiency in strategic decision-making and their potential for human-like gameplay.\n2\nRelated Work\nStarCraft II Full Game AI: StarCraft AI research, initially focused on StarCraft I with developments\nlike BiCNet [19] for multi-agent coordination, has significantly advanced in the StarCraft II era. The\nrelease of PySC2 [23] by DeepMind, coupled with Blizzard’s game replays, propelled this research\nfield. A key breakthrough was AlphaStar [24], which achieved Grandmaster level and defeated top\nplayers, demonstrating the potential of RL in complex environments.\nSubsequent research expanded upon these foundations. Mini-AlphaStar [13] simplified input variables\nwithout compromising learning effectiveness. TG [12] and HierNet-SC2 [14] explored efficient RL\nstrategies, with the latter bypassing supervised pre-training. AlphaStar Unplugged [16] represented a\nleap in offline RL using human replays. TStarBotsX [7] and SCC [26] furthered federated learning\napproaches, achieving notable success against master and grandmaster level players.\nRecent advancements include DI-star 3, which is accessible for home computer deployment, and\nROA-Star [9], enhancing AlphaStar’s training framework with goal-conditioned exploiters and refined\nopponent modeling techniques. ROA-Star’s practical tests against professional players have shown\nimpressive results, marking significant progress in real-time strategy AI.\n2https:\/\/github.com\/BurnySc2\/python-sc2\n3https:\/\/github.com\/opendilab\/DI-star\n2\nLLM Agent and Benchmark: The introduction of GPT3.5 [17] has significantly propelled the\nresearch on LLM agents forward. Projects such as React [29] and AutoGPT 4 laid the groundwork for\nmore sophisticated implementations. Within the MineDojo environment [5]5, initiatives like GITM\n[33], Voyager [25], and others [6, 28, 10] have underscored LLM agents’ adaptability to a variety\nof tasks and expansive open-world scenarios. Additionally, environments like TextWorld [4] and\nALFWorld [20] enrich agent training by integrating text-based strategy and action execution across\nsimulated and visual contexts, facilitating advanced generalization and adaptive learning. Additionally,\noptimization methods such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)[31] have also\nimproved the performance of large language models.\nFurther advancements in multi-agent coordination and virtual social dynamics have been achieved\nthrough MetaGPT [8], Camel [11], and Generative Agents [18]. Benchmarking platforms such\nas AGENTBENCH play a critical role in evaluating these developments, with AGENTBENCH\nexamining decision-making in comprehensive, open-ended contexts.\nIn StarCraft II, despite the development of advanced AI agents, there remains a gap in evaluating\nLLMs, especially in real-time strategy and long-term planning. This led to the creation of TextStar-\nCraft II, an environment tailored for testing LLMs in these specific aspects, filling a critical need for\nnatural language interaction capabilities in AI research.\n3\nTextStarCraft II\nTextStarCraft II provides a text-based interface for LLMs within the SC2 environment, utilizing\nthe python-sc2 framework to translate complex gameplay into text. Key components include the\nObservation-to-Text Adapter and the Text-to-Action Adapter.TextStarCraft II stands out from\nother text-based environments like TextWorld and ALFWorld due to its more complex and dynamic\ngameplay. It requires agents to manage multiple aspects such as resource allocation, base building, and\nmilitary strategy in real-time, challenging both their adaptability and decision-making. Additionally,\nthe environment demands advanced language understanding to interpret and execute more open-ended\nand diverse commands, enhancing the need for sophisticated natural language processing capabilities.\nWe will introduce the main components of TextStarCraft II below.\nObservation\nTextStarCraft II’s observation space is designed to equip LLM agents with essential\ngame insights, effectively navigating the fog of war in StarCraft II. The observations encompass six\nkey categories:\n• Resources: Critical game resources and supply levels.\n• Units: Types and quantities of the player’s units.\n• Buildings: Information on the player’s buildings.\n• In-Process Activities: Ongoing construction and production data.\n• Enemy Status: Visible enemy units and buildings\n• Research Progress: Updates on the player’s technological advancements.\nThis structured approach in the observation space enables LLM agents to efficiently process and\nutilize vital game data for strategic decision-making in TextStarCraft II.\nAction\nThere are mainly two types of actions: Macro Actions and Micro Actions.\n• Macro Actions: Covering broad strategic decisions such as Training Units, Building Struc-\ntures, Researching Technologies, and Other Strategic Maneuvers.\n• Micro Actions: Script-managed for precise placements and targeting, not directly controlled\nby the agent.\nReward\nThe reward function R is crucial for aligning agent behavior with the game’s objectives,\nassigning values of {−1, 0, 1} based on losing, drawing, or winning a match.\n4https:\/\/github.com\/Significant-Gravitas\/AutoGPT\n5https:\/\/github.com\/MineDojo\/MineDojo\n3\nAction \nqueue\nTextStarCraft2\nText to Action\nMulti-frame observation\nObs to Text\nObservation \nqueue\nChain of \nSummarization\nAnalysis\nSuggestions\nDecisions\nL2\nSituation Overview\nSituation Analysis\nStrategic Planning\nOpponent Strategy \nAnalysis\nStrategic \nRecommendations\nDecision-Making \nProcess\nUser \nexample\nL1\nL1\nOutput\nSystem prompt\nSingle \nframe obs\nLLM\nLLM \/ \nrule-based\nFigure 1: Interacting with LLM using the Enhanced Chain of Summarization (CoS) Method in\nTextStarCraft II. This streamlined LLM-driven gameplay. It begins with initialization, where initial\ngame data is converted to text for processing. Next, Single-Frame and Multi-Frame Summarization\nrefine and summarize observations into actionable insights using advanced LLM reasoning. In\nDirective Formulation and Action Scheduling, these insights are segmented into specific actions and\nqueued for execution. The process concludes with Action Retrieval and Execution, where actions\nare implemented in the game. This cycle continually converts new data into text, enhancing LLM\nperformance in the TextStarCraft II.\nGame Modes\nTextStarCraft II offers diverse modes to enrich strategic gameplay: First, the Built-in\nAI mode, offers 10 difficulty levels and 6 strategic styles for diverse challenges. Second, the Agent\nAI mode, enables players to compete against both rule-based AIs and other LLM agents. Third, the\nHuman mode, facilitates interactions with real-world players, enhancing the realism of gameplay.\n4\nChain of Summarization\nThe Chain of Summarization (CoS) method, integral to the TextStarCraft II framework, draws\ninspiration from computer hardware’s cache mechanisms and RL’s frame skipping techniques. Serving\nas an enhancement to traditional Chains of Thought (CoT) [27] and as a standard plug-in, CoS refines\nstrategic decision-making in StarCraft II through:\n• Information Compression: It focuses on key data, reducing overload and sharpening\nstrategic clarity.\n• Inference Acceleration: This approach speeds up decision-making by providing a more\ncomprehensive view of the game’s state.\n• Global Understanding: CoS equips LLMs with a deeper grasp of game strategies, leading\nto expert-level decisions.\nAs a versatile tool within the TextStarCraft II framework, CoS can operate both as a standalone\nplug-in, enhancing the environment’s utility, and as a direct interface for user interaction with\nTextStarCraft II. This dual functionality not only showcases CoS as an exemplary model for engaging\nwith our environment but also invites further development and customization by the community,\nbroadening the scope of strategic AI research in gaming. CoS includes Single-Frame Summarization,\nMulti-Frame Summarization, and Action Extraction for the Action Queue.\nSingle-Frame Summarization\nTo make TextStarCraft’s raw observation data more comprehensible\nfor LLMs, Single-frame Summarization compresses and extracts key information. This process, de-\n4\nAlgorithm 1 Chain of Summarization Interaction in TextStarCraft II\nInput: TextStarCraft II game environment env, Chain length K\n1: Set up the environment and obtain the initial raw observation o0 = env.reset()\n2: Initialize the raw observation queue Qobs, action queue Qaction and total reward R = 0\n3: Add K instances of raw observation o0 to the raw observation queue Qobs\n4: while env is not terminated do\n5:\nif len(Qobs) ≥K then\n6:\nInitialize Single-Frame Summarization Queue QSFS\n▷CoS start\n7:\nfor raw observation o in Qobs do\n8:\nPerform Single-Frame Summarization ˆo = SSF(o)\n9:\nAdd ˆo to the Single-Frame Summarization Queue QSFS\n10:\nend for\n11:\nPerform Multi-Frame summarization σ = SMF(QSFS)\n12:\nApply Chain of Thought reasoning υ = CoT(σ)\n13:\nextract K actions (a1, a2 · · · , aK) = Ex(υ)\n▷CoS end\n14:\nAdd the K actions (a1, a2 · · · , aK) to the action queue Qaction\n15:\nend if\n16:\nObtain the next action at from the action queue Qaction\n17:\nGet the reward rt and the next observation ot+1 from the environment rt, ot+1 = env.step(at)\n18:\nAdd the raw observation ot+1 to the raw observation queue Qobs\n19:\nR ←R + rt\n20: end while\n21: return total reward R\nnoted as SSF(·), transforms dense TextStarCraft II observations o into a condensed form ˆo, described\nby:\nˆo = SSF(o).\n(1)\nThere are two approaches to this compression: a language model-based approach using few-shot\nlearning for better alignment with game rules and a faster, rule-based approach for extraction and\nfiltering. In our experiments, the rule-based approach is primarily used for quicker interactions.\nMulti-Frame Summarization\nTraditional methods query LLMs at each time step for decision-\nmaking ([3], [32]). However, this is inefficient for long-duration games like StarCraft II due to high\ncomputation costs and slower LLM inference. Our Multi-Frame Summarization method, inspired by\ncaching in computer hardware and frame skipping in RL, addresses these issues. It synchronizes the\nquick pace of the game with LLM processing, ensuring real-time decision-making efficiency and\nimproved comprehension in complex scenarios. Instead of constant LLM querying, we aggregate\ncondensed observation information ˆo for K steps into a period summary σ, described by:\nσ = SMF(ˆo1, ˆo2, · · · , ˆoK).\n(2)\nThis method enables comprehensive analysis and strategic planning through a series of steps, including\nsituation overview, analysis, strategic planning, opponent strategy analysis, suggestion formulation,\nand decision-making. This process is formalized as υ, which is the output of CoT reasoning for\nsummarization σ, given by:\nυ = CoT(σ).\n(3)\nAction Extraction for Action Queue\nThe action queue forms a critical link between the Multi-\nFrame Summarization results, υ, and the TextStarCraft II environment, facilitating communication\nbetween the LLM and the game. Within υ, key components include analysis, suggestions, and\ndecisions. To convert these into actionable steps, we employ regular expression matching and\nsimilarity searching in our action extractor, donated as Ex(·).

Following this, the method translates these summaries into strategic action plans.\nFinally, it implements the planned actions within the game, thereby completing the decision cycle.\nThis process is depicted in Figure 1. This approach, which updates actions every few frames,\neffectively manages the fast-paced dynamics of StarCraft II, thereby proving essential for real-time\nstrategic gameplay. The pseudocode is as shown in Algorithm 1.\n5\nExperiment\nIn our experiment, we detail the setup and key metrics (evaluation metrics detailed in Appendix B.2.)\nto evaluate macro-strategic decision-making in StarCraft II. We assess the Chain of Summarization’s\nimpact on LLM gameplay, compare various LLMs’ performance, and evaluate their grasp of StarCraft\nII strategies. Our experiments also concludes with human-AI interaction tests.\n5.1\nPerformance Evaluation of Various LLMs\nIn this section, we assess the performance of closed-source LLMs [21], Llama2 70B [22], and\nfine-tuned open-source LLMs such as ChatGLM3 6B [30] and Qwen 1.8B [1] in the TextStarCraft II\nenvironment against the built-in AI at level 5. The experimental results are shown in Table 1, with the\nevaluation metrics detailed in Appendix B.2. We tested closed-source LLMs and the un-fine-tuned\nLlama2 70B using the standard CoS method. The closed-source models performed well, while\nLlama2 70B could not understand the task requirements and was unable to generate commands based\non the given prompts.\nAdditionally, we fine-tuned open-source models using the entire dataset of GPT3.5-turbo-16k inter-\naction logs with TextStarCraft II. Due to computational resource limitations, we removed the CoT\ncomponent, keeping only the inputs and outputs. The results showed that all evaluated closed-source\nLLMs were capable of defeating the level 5 built-in AI. The fine-tuned open-source models, despite a\nloss in strategic diversity, still managed to overcome the level 5 AI, predominantly adopting a strategy\nfocused on mass-producing stalkers.\nFinally, we investigated the impact of data quality using the Average Population Utilization (APU)\nmetric (detailed in Appendix B.2) to partition the dataset. The results (Table 2) demonstrated that fine-\ntuning on wins from the top 25% APU games yielded the highest win rate (54\/100), while using the\nfull dataset resulted in a lower win rate (28\/100). This suggests that training data quality, especially\nthe inclusion of high-performing games, significantly impacts fine-tuned model performance in\nTextStarCraft II.\n6\nTable 2: Performance of models fine-tuned on various datasets in TextStarCraft II, showing win rates.\nDatasets are differentiated based on whether they contain all games or only wins, and, for subsets of\nwins, based on the APU performance percentile.\nDATASET\nWIN RATE\nFULL DATASET (ALL GAMES)\n28\/100\nWINS DATASET (ALL WINS)\n48\/100\nWINS DATASET (BOTTOM 25% APU, 75-100%)\n29\/100\nWINS DATASET (50-75% APU)\n37\/100\nWINS DATASET (25-50% APU)\n39\/100\nWINS DATASET (TOP 25% APU, 0-25%)\n54\/100\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nQ5\nMain Questions\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nScores\nGPT4 Evaluation of LLMs Performance Across Main Questions\nBard\nChatGPT\nClaude2\nGPT4\n(a) GPT4 Evaluation of Questions\nBard\nChatGPT\nClaude2\nGPT4\nModels\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nScores\nGPT4 Evaluation of LLMs Performances\nBard\nChatGPT\nClaude2\nGPT4\n(b) GPT4 Evaluation of LLMs\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nQ5\nMain Questions\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nScores\nHuman Experts Evaluation of LLMs Performance Across Main Questions\nBard\nChatGPT\nClaude2\nGPT4\n(c) Human Evaluation of Questions\nBard\nChatGPT\nClaude2\nGPT4\nModels\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nScores\nHuman Experts Evaluation of LLMs Performances\nBard\nChatGPT\nClaude2\nGPT4\n(d) Human Evaluation of LLMs\nFigure 2: The result of Double-Blind Assessment.\n5.2\nAssessing LLMs’ Mastery of StarCraft II Concepts\nWe evaluated the understanding of StarCraft II by LLMs like GPT3.5 and GPT-4, focusing on their\nknowledge of build orders and game mechanics sourced from prominent StarCraft II forums. Despite\na reasonable grasp of basic game dynamics, these models faced challenges with more complex\nelements like the tech tree and supply constraints.\nEvaluation Methodology: To gauge the depth of LLMs’ StarCraft II knowledge, we tested models,\nincluding ChatGPT (GPT3.5), GPT-4, Claude2, and Bard, across five areas: Basic Knowledge, Racial\nMechanics, Typical Strategies, Standard Build Orders, and Classic Strategies and Counterplays\n(detailed in Appendix G). We used a double-blind evaluation, with both Grandmaster-level human\nexperts and GPT-4 assessing the responses to ensure unbiased scoring.\nEvaluation Results: Both human experts and GPT-4 assessed the LLMs, illustrated in Figures 2 and\nTable 6, leading to the following insights: In the evaluation of LLMs on a set of complex questions,\nGPT-4 and ChatGPT demonstrated the best performance, with GPT-4 receiving high scores from\nboth itself and human experts. Claude2 had mixed results, with GPT-4 rating it higher than human\nexperts did. Bard struggled with the complex questions, receiving the lowest scores, especially on\nquestions 3, 4, and 5. Overall, the LLMs were ranked as follows: GPT-4, ChatGPT, Claude2, and\nBard. It is worth noting that GPT-4’s self-assessment showed more variability compared to the more\nbalanced evaluations provided by human experts.\n7\nTable 3: Match Results: Finetuned Qwen1.8B vs Human.\nHUMAN PLAYER\nRANK\nMMR\nRESULT\nPLAYER A\nPRO GAMER\n5918\n0\/10\nPLAYER B\nGRANDMASTER\n5001\n0\/10\nPLAYER C\nGOLD\n2556\n5\/10\nPLAYER D\nNEW PLAYER\n\/\n10\/10\n5.3\nHuman-AI Interaction\nFollowing insights from Section 5.1, we evaluated the fine-tuned Qwen1.8B model’s real-time\ninteraction with human players on home PCs, requiring only 4GB of GPU memory. This model faced\nhuman players of varied skills from the Asian server, including a Grandmaster, a Gold-level player,\nand a novice, all playing as Zerg against the Protoss-configured LLM agent. Results, detailed in Table\n3, show the LLM agent achieving competitive performance, on par with a Gold-level player. This\nhighlights the LLM’s adaptability in strategic play and marks a significant step towards integrating\nAI into competitive gaming environments on accessible home computing setups.\n6\nAnalysis\n6.1\nImpact of Different Prompts\nIn evaluating the Chain of Summarization method using the GPT3.5-turbo-16k model in TextStarCraft\nII, we analyzed the effects of two different prompt types on LLM agent performance when playing as\nProtoss against Zerg. The results, detailed in Table 4, showed a notable improvement in performance\nwith more complex prompts.\nTable 4: LLM Agent Win Rates (%) vs. TextStarCraft II AI at Varied Difficulty Levels.\nPROMPT\nLV1\nLV2\nLV3\nLV4\nLV5\nLV6\nPROMPT 1\n87.50\n66.67\n25.00\n12.50\n0.00\n0.00\nPROMPT 2\n100.00\n100.00\n100.00\n84.00\n50.00\n8.33\nSimple Thought Chain:\nUsing a basic prompt (see Prompt 1), the LLM agent could perform\nelementary operations like worker production, base establishment, and basic combat unit production.\nHowever, this approach was limited in developing advanced strategies, such as research upgrades or\ncomprehensive game analysis, indicating a narrower strategic depth with simpler prompts.\nComplex Thought Chain:\nA more intricate prompt (see Prompt 2) guided the LLM agent through\na series of critical phases, including situation overview, analysis, strategic planning, and decision-\nmaking. This comprehensive approach enabled the agent to engage in advanced strategies like research\nupgrades, tech tree exploration, and complex military maneuvers. It proved particularly effective\nagainst higher difficulty levels (e.g., \"Harder\" lv 5 ), showcasing enhanced strategic capabilities.\nOur analysis underscores the importance of complex prompts that replicate the thought processes of\nseasoned StarCraft II players. These advanced prompts are essential for LLMs to fully understand\nand strategically engage in the sophisticated aspects of the game.\n6.2\nPolicy Interpretability\nOur analysis reveals a stark contrast in decision-making between AlphaStar and our LLM agent.\nWhile AlphaStar demonstrates superior micromanagement skills, it occasionally lacks rationality in\nits strategic choices. Conversely, the LLM agent consistently exhibits logical decision-making, as\nevidenced by its proactive anticipation of threats and strategic planning, detailed in Appendix E and\nAppendix F.\nAnticipating Threats:\nFigure 3 illustrates a stark contrast between AlphaStar and the LLM agent\nin their ability to anticipate and respond to potential threats.

This oversight leaves AlphaStar’s base vulnerable to a devastating attack, highlighting\nits inability to proactively assess and mitigate potential risks. Conversely, in Figure 3.b, the LLM\nagent demonstrates remarkable foresight by analyzing the enemy’s strategy and recommending\nappropriate defensive measures. The agent’s log data at 05:00 game time reveals its ability to infer\nthe enemy’s Roach-centric strategy based on the presence of key structures such as the Roach Warren\nand Spawning Pool. Armed with this insight, the LLM agent provides a structured decision-making\nframework to address the identified threat:\n• Enemy’s Strategy: The enemy has established a Hatchery, Roach Warren, Extrac-\ntor, and Spawning Pool. This indicates a potential strategy centered around Roach\nproduction and early aggression.\n• Given the enemy’s potential for early aggression with Roaches, we should prioritize\ndefensive structures such as Photon Cannons and Shield Batteries. Additionally,\nconsider scouting the enemy base to gather more information about their strategy.\n• Decisions:0: <BUILD PHOTONCANNON> 1: <BUILD SHIELDBATTERY>\nFlexible Unit Composition:\nAlphaStar often adheres to fixed unit compositions, leading to inef-\nfective strategies in dynamic scenarios (Figure 13.a-d). In contrast, the LLM agent demonstrates\nadaptability in unit selection, effectively countering varied enemy tactics (Figure 13.e-h). For instance,\nin Figure 13.f, the Zerg (Built-in AI) employs a Hydra-Roach composition. The LLM agent, playing\nas Protoss in 09:00, recognizes the need to adapt its strategy based on the enemy’s ground-based\narmy. The agent’s thought process, as shown in the log, reveals its ability to analyze the situation and\nmake informed decisions:\n• Enemy’s Strategy: The enemy seems to be focusing on a ground-based army composi-\ntion, consisting of Roaches, Swarm hosts and Hydralisks.\n• Key Information: The most important aspect at this moment is our need to expand\nour unit composition and technology tree to counter the enemy’s strategy effectively.\nWe should prioritize unlocking advanced units and upgrades to gain an advantage.\nConsider researching psionic storm at the Templar Archives to deal with the enemy’s\nground units effectively.\n• Decisions: 4: <RESEARCH PSISTORMTECH>\nThe LLM agent’s superior performance in threat anticipation and unit composition adaptability stems\nfrom its structured, transparent decision-making process. By analyzing the situation, identifying\nkey information, and making informed decisions based on the evolving game state, the LLM agent\ndemonstrates a blend of human knowledge and logical reasoning. This approach enhances the\n9\ninterpretability of the agent’s gameplay, facilitating better collaboration and strategic adaptation in\ncomplex scenarios, ultimately leading to more successful outcomes compared to AlphaStar’s opaque\nstrategies.\n7\nDiscussion\nTextStarCraft II enhances the use of LLMs for strategic decision-making in StarCraft II, showcasing\ntheir capabilities in adaptive strategy and crisis management.

However, there is a notable gap in benchmarks for\nreal-time strategic decision-making. StarCraft II (SC2), with its complex and\ndynamic nature, serves as an ideal setting for such evaluations. To this end, we\nhave developed TextStarCraft II, a specialized environment for assessing LLMs in\nreal-time strategic scenarios within SC2. Addressing the limitations of traditional\nChain of Thought (CoT) methods, we introduce the Chain of Summarization (CoS)\nmethod, enhancing LLMs’ capabilities in rapid and effective decision-making.

StarCraft II (SC2), one of the world’s\nmost popular and challenging e-sports, exemplifies these demands through its dynamic gameplay.\nPlayers must manage resources, construct bases, and command armies while making quick decisions\nand adapting their long-term strategies to evolving battlefield conditions. The game’s layered\ngameplay spans economic management, military strategy, and tactical execution, making SC2 a\nvaluable model for AI research, particularly in reinforcement learning (RL). SC2’s complexity, real-\ntime nature, and the fact that it is considered one of the hardest games in the world pose significant\nchallenges for AI systems, requiring them to master various aspects of the game simultaneously.\nFurther details about StarCraft II can be found in the appendix A. Pioneering efforts, exemplified by\nDeepMind’s AlphaStar [24], have demonstrated significant advancements in this domain, showcasing\nAI’s growing proficiency in strategic gameplay. With the evolution of LLMs in areas like reasoning,\nplanning, and decision-making, these models have begun to show potential in tasks traditionally\ndominated by RL approaches. Benchmarks such as AGENTBENCH [15] have been instrumental in\nevaluating these capabilities in multi-turn, open-ended contexts. However, despite these developments,\n∗Corresponding to Haifeng Zhang⟨haifeng.zhang@ia.ac.cn⟩and Jun Wang ⟨jun.wang@cs.ucl.ac.uk⟩.\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).\narXiv:2312.11865v3  [cs.AI]  18 Jun 2024\na specific benchmark for assessing LLMs’ capabilities in real-time strategy decision-making and\nlong-term planning in environments like StarCraft II is conspicuously absent.\nTherefore, we have chosen SC2 as the benchmark for evaluating the real-time strategy decision-\nmaking and long-term planning capabilities of LLMs. Given the lack of language support in existing\nSC2 environments, we developed TextStarCraft II. Utilizing the python-sc2 framework, TextStarCraft\nII converts the complex gameplay dynamics of SC2 into an interactive, text-based format. The\npython-sc2 interface 2 is utilized to convert game data into text, enabling LLM agents to perform\nmacro-strategic actions through language commands. For micro-strategic actions, we implement\na rule-based approach akin to that used by OpenAI Five [2], employing predefined Python scripts.\nThis allows LLM agents to engage in competition against the game’s built-in AI, other LLM agents,\nand human players through the execution of these scripted actions. Addressing the challenges posed\nby the intricate decision-making process in SC2, we propose the Chain of Summarization(CoS)\nmethod. This approach enhances the capacity of LLM Agents in processing complex information and\nmaking strategic decisions by incorporating single-frame and multi-frame summarization modules,\neach aiding in understanding the immediate game state and processing sequential data for strategy\nformulation and decision-making.\nIn this study, we conduct a thorough exploration of LLMs’ application and effectiveness within\nSC2 via the TextStarCraft II environment. Our experimental framework includes assessing the CoS\nmethod, evaluating the performance of proprietary and fine-tuned open-source LLMs in TextStarCraft\nII, testing real-time human-computer interaction, and using StarCraft II-themed question-answering\ntasks evaluated by human experts. We also analyze the impact of varying prompts on LLMs, their\nstrategic preferences, and the interpretability of their decision-making processes.\nOur contributions are manifold:\n• TextStarCraft II Development: We present TextStarCraft II, a novel environment that not\nonly enables the evaluation of LLMs in strategic gaming contexts but also supports real-time\nhuman-computer interactions.\n• Chain of Summarization Method and Agent: By introducing the CoS method and\nreleasing an open-source agent, we offer a powerful example and a high-level interface for\nthe community, fostering further development and interaction with TextStarCraft II.\n• Diverse Evaluations of LLMs: Our extensive evaluations encompass testing LLMs against\nthe game’s built-in AI, assessing their understanding of StarCraft II through human expert\nreviews, and conducting human-AI matches. These diverse methodologies underscore LLMs’\nproficiency in strategic decision-making and their potential for human-like gameplay.\n2\nRelated Work\nStarCraft II Full Game AI: StarCraft AI research, initially focused on StarCraft I with developments\nlike BiCNet [19] for multi-agent coordination, has significantly advanced in the StarCraft II era. The\nrelease of PySC2 [23] by DeepMind, coupled with Blizzard’s game replays, propelled this research\nfield. A key breakthrough was AlphaStar [24], which achieved Grandmaster level and defeated top\nplayers, demonstrating the potential of RL in complex environments.\nSubsequent research expanded upon these foundations. Mini-AlphaStar [13] simplified input variables\nwithout compromising learning effectiveness. TG [12] and HierNet-SC2 [14] explored efficient RL\nstrategies, with the latter bypassing supervised pre-training. AlphaStar Unplugged [16] represented a\nleap in offline RL using human replays. TStarBotsX [7] and SCC [26] furthered federated learning\napproaches, achieving notable success against master and grandmaster level players.\nRecent advancements include DI-star 3, which is accessible for home computer deployment, and\nROA-Star [9], enhancing AlphaStar’s training framework with goal-conditioned exploiters and refined\nopponent modeling techniques. ROA-Star’s practical tests against professional players have shown\nimpressive results, marking significant progress in real-time strategy AI.\n2https:\/\/github.com\/BurnySc2\/python-sc2\n3https:\/\/github.com\/opendilab\/DI-star\n2\nLLM Agent and Benchmark: The introduction of GPT3.5 [17] has significantly propelled the\nresearch on LLM agents forward. Projects such as React [29] and AutoGPT 4 laid the groundwork for\nmore sophisticated implementations. Within the MineDojo environment [5]5, initiatives like GITM\n[33], Voyager [25], and others [6, 28, 10] have underscored LLM agents’ adaptability to a variety\nof tasks and expansive open-world scenarios. Additionally, environments like TextWorld [4] and\nALFWorld [20] enrich agent training by integrating text-based strategy and action execution across\nsimulated and visual contexts, facilitating advanced generalization and adaptive learning. Additionally,\noptimization methods such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)[31] have also\nimproved the performance of large language models.\nFurther advancements in multi-agent coordination and virtual social dynamics have been achieved\nthrough MetaGPT [8], Camel [11], and Generative Agents [18]. Benchmarking platforms such\nas AGENTBENCH play a critical role in evaluating these developments, with AGENTBENCH\nexamining decision-making in comprehensive, open-ended contexts.\nIn StarCraft II, despite the development of advanced AI agents, there remains a gap in evaluating\nLLMs, especially in real-time strategy and long-term planning. This led to the creation of TextStar-\nCraft II, an environment tailored for testing LLMs in these specific aspects, filling a critical need for\nnatural language interaction capabilities in AI research.\n3\nTextStarCraft II\nTextStarCraft II provides a text-based interface for LLMs within the SC2 environment, utilizing\nthe python-sc2 framework to translate complex gameplay into text. Key components include the\nObservation-to-Text Adapter and the Text-to-Action Adapter.TextStarCraft II stands out from\nother text-based environments like TextWorld and ALFWorld due to its more complex and dynamic\ngameplay. It requires agents to manage multiple aspects such as resource allocation, base building, and\nmilitary strategy in real-time, challenging both their adaptability and decision-making. Additionally,\nthe environment demands advanced language understanding to interpret and execute more open-ended\nand diverse commands, enhancing the need for sophisticated natural language processing capabilities.\nWe will introduce the main components of TextStarCraft II below.\nObservation\nTextStarCraft II’s observation space is designed to equip LLM agents with essential\ngame insights, effectively navigating the fog of war in StarCraft II.

The process concludes with Action Retrieval and Execution, where actions\nare implemented in the game. This cycle continually converts new data into text, enhancing LLM\nperformance in the TextStarCraft II.\nGame Modes\nTextStarCraft II offers diverse modes to enrich strategic gameplay: First, the Built-in\nAI mode, offers 10 difficulty levels and 6 strategic styles for diverse challenges. Second, the Agent\nAI mode, enables players to compete against both rule-based AIs and other LLM agents. Third, the\nHuman mode, facilitates interactions with real-world players, enhancing the realism of gameplay.\n4\nChain of Summarization\nThe Chain of Summarization (CoS) method, integral to the TextStarCraft II framework, draws\ninspiration from computer hardware’s cache mechanisms and RL’s frame skipping techniques. Serving\nas an enhancement to traditional Chains of Thought (CoT) [27] and as a standard plug-in, CoS refines\nstrategic decision-making in StarCraft II through:\n• Information Compression: It focuses on key data, reducing overload and sharpening\nstrategic clarity.\n• Inference Acceleration: This approach speeds up decision-making by providing a more\ncomprehensive view of the game’s state.\n• Global Understanding: CoS equips LLMs with a deeper grasp of game strategies, leading\nto expert-level decisions.\nAs a versatile tool within the TextStarCraft II framework, CoS can operate both as a standalone\nplug-in, enhancing the environment’s utility, and as a direct interface for user interaction with\nTextStarCraft II. This dual functionality not only showcases CoS as an exemplary model for engaging\nwith our environment but also invites further development and customization by the community,\nbroadening the scope of strategic AI research in gaming. CoS includes Single-Frame Summarization,\nMulti-Frame Summarization, and Action Extraction for the Action Queue.\nSingle-Frame Summarization\nTo make TextStarCraft’s raw observation data more comprehensible\nfor LLMs, Single-frame Summarization compresses and extracts key information. This process, de-\n4\nAlgorithm 1 Chain of Summarization Interaction in TextStarCraft II\nInput: TextStarCraft II game environment env, Chain length K\n1: Set up the environment and obtain the initial raw observation o0 = env.reset()\n2: Initialize the raw observation queue Qobs, action queue Qaction and total reward R = 0\n3: Add K instances of raw observation o0 to the raw observation queue Qobs\n4: while env is not terminated do\n5:\nif len(Qobs) ≥K then\n6:\nInitialize Single-Frame Summarization Queue QSFS\n▷CoS start\n7:\nfor raw observation o in Qobs do\n8:\nPerform Single-Frame Summarization ˆo = SSF(o)\n9:\nAdd ˆo to the Single-Frame Summarization Queue QSFS\n10:\nend for\n11:\nPerform Multi-Frame summarization σ = SMF(QSFS)\n12:\nApply Chain of Thought reasoning υ = CoT(σ)\n13:\nextract K actions (a1, a2 · · · , aK) = Ex(υ)\n▷CoS end\n14:\nAdd the K actions (a1, a2 · · · , aK) to the action queue Qaction\n15:\nend if\n16:\nObtain the next action at from the action queue Qaction\n17:\nGet the reward rt and the next observation ot+1 from the environment rt, ot+1 = env.step(at)\n18:\nAdd the raw observation ot+1 to the raw observation queue Qobs\n19:\nR ←R + rt\n20: end while\n21: return total reward R\nnoted as SSF(·), transforms dense TextStarCraft II observations o into a condensed form ˆo, described\nby:\nˆo = SSF(o).\n(1)\nThere are two approaches to this compression: a language model-based approach using few-shot\nlearning for better alignment with game rules and a faster, rule-based approach for extraction and\nfiltering. In our experiments, the rule-based approach is primarily used for quicker interactions.\nMulti-Frame Summarization\nTraditional methods query LLMs at each time step for decision-\nmaking ([3], [32]). However, this is inefficient for long-duration games like StarCraft II due to high\ncomputation costs and slower LLM inference. Our Multi-Frame Summarization method, inspired by\ncaching in computer hardware and frame skipping in RL, addresses these issues. It synchronizes the\nquick pace of the game with LLM processing, ensuring real-time decision-making efficiency and\nimproved comprehension in complex scenarios. Instead of constant LLM querying, we aggregate\ncondensed observation information ˆo for K steps into a period summary σ, described by:\nσ = SMF(ˆo1, ˆo2, · · · , ˆoK).\n(2)\nThis method enables comprehensive analysis and strategic planning through a series of steps, including\nsituation overview, analysis, strategic planning, opponent strategy analysis, suggestion formulation,\nand decision-making. This process is formalized as υ, which is the output of CoT reasoning for\nsummarization σ, given by:\nυ = CoT(σ).\n(3)\nAction Extraction for Action Queue\nThe action queue forms a critical link between the Multi-\nFrame Summarization results, υ, and the TextStarCraft II environment, facilitating communication\nbetween the LLM and the game. Within υ, key components include analysis, suggestions, and\ndecisions. To convert these into actionable steps, we employ regular expression matching and\nsimilarity searching in our action extractor, donated as Ex(·). This process populates the action\nqueue with actions ready for execution in TextStarCraft II. From the output υ of CoT reasoning, we\nutilize the action extractor to extract K actions, as formalized in:\n(a1, a2, · · · , aK) = Ex(υ).\n(4)\n5\nTable 1: Performance of LLMs in TextStarCraft II: Comparing models using either the full CoS or\nCoS without CoT.

Next, it distills key game observations to provide a concise snapshot of the\ncurrent situation. Following this, the method translates these summaries into strategic action plans.\nFinally, it implements the planned actions within the game, thereby completing the decision cycle.\nThis process is depicted in Figure 1. This approach, which updates actions every few frames,\neffectively manages the fast-paced dynamics of StarCraft II, thereby proving essential for real-time\nstrategic gameplay. The pseudocode is as shown in Algorithm 1.\n5\nExperiment\nIn our experiment, we detail the setup and key metrics (evaluation metrics detailed in Appendix B.2.)\nto evaluate macro-strategic decision-making in StarCraft II. We assess the Chain of Summarization’s\nimpact on LLM gameplay, compare various LLMs’ performance, and evaluate their grasp of StarCraft\nII strategies. Our experiments also concludes with human-AI interaction tests.\n5.1\nPerformance Evaluation of Various LLMs\nIn this section, we assess the performance of closed-source LLMs [21], Llama2 70B [22], and\nfine-tuned open-source LLMs such as ChatGLM3 6B [30] and Qwen 1.8B [1] in the TextStarCraft II\nenvironment against the built-in AI at level 5. The experimental results are shown in Table 1, with the\nevaluation metrics detailed in Appendix B.2. We tested closed-source LLMs and the un-fine-tuned\nLlama2 70B using the standard CoS method. The closed-source models performed well, while\nLlama2 70B could not understand the task requirements and was unable to generate commands based\non the given prompts.\nAdditionally, we fine-tuned open-source models using the entire dataset of GPT3.5-turbo-16k inter-\naction logs with TextStarCraft II. Due to computational resource limitations, we removed the CoT\ncomponent, keeping only the inputs and outputs. The results showed that all evaluated closed-source\nLLMs were capable of defeating the level 5 built-in AI. The fine-tuned open-source models, despite a\nloss in strategic diversity, still managed to overcome the level 5 AI, predominantly adopting a strategy\nfocused on mass-producing stalkers.\nFinally, we investigated the impact of data quality using the Average Population Utilization (APU)\nmetric (detailed in Appendix B.2) to partition the dataset. The results (Table 2) demonstrated that fine-\ntuning on wins from the top 25% APU games yielded the highest win rate (54\/100), while using the\nfull dataset resulted in a lower win rate (28\/100). This suggests that training data quality, especially\nthe inclusion of high-performing games, significantly impacts fine-tuned model performance in\nTextStarCraft II.\n6\nTable 2: Performance of models fine-tuned on various datasets in TextStarCraft II, showing win rates.\nDatasets are differentiated based on whether they contain all games or only wins, and, for subsets of\nwins, based on the APU performance percentile.\nDATASET\nWIN RATE\nFULL DATASET (ALL GAMES)\n28\/100\nWINS DATASET (ALL WINS)\n48\/100\nWINS DATASET (BOTTOM 25% APU, 75-100%)\n29\/100\nWINS DATASET (50-75% APU)\n37\/100\nWINS DATASET (25-50% APU)\n39\/100\nWINS DATASET (TOP 25% APU, 0-25%)\n54\/100\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nQ5\nMain Questions\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nScores\nGPT4 Evaluation of LLMs Performance Across Main Questions\nBard\nChatGPT\nClaude2\nGPT4\n(a) GPT4 Evaluation of Questions\nBard\nChatGPT\nClaude2\nGPT4\nModels\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nScores\nGPT4 Evaluation of LLMs Performances\nBard\nChatGPT\nClaude2\nGPT4\n(b) GPT4 Evaluation of LLMs\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nQ5\nMain Questions\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nScores\nHuman Experts Evaluation of LLMs Performance Across Main Questions\nBard\nChatGPT\nClaude2\nGPT4\n(c) Human Evaluation of Questions\nBard\nChatGPT\nClaude2\nGPT4\nModels\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nScores\nHuman Experts Evaluation of LLMs Performances\nBard\nChatGPT\nClaude2\nGPT4\n(d) Human Evaluation of LLMs\nFigure 2: The result of Double-Blind Assessment.\n5.2\nAssessing LLMs’ Mastery of StarCraft II Concepts\nWe evaluated the understanding of StarCraft II by LLMs like GPT3.5 and GPT-4, focusing on their\nknowledge of build orders and game mechanics sourced from prominent StarCraft II forums. Despite\na reasonable grasp of basic game dynamics, these models faced challenges with more complex\nelements like the tech tree and supply constraints.\nEvaluation Methodology: To gauge the depth of LLMs’ StarCraft II knowledge, we tested models,\nincluding ChatGPT (GPT3.5), GPT-4, Claude2, and Bard, across five areas: Basic Knowledge, Racial\nMechanics, Typical Strategies, Standard Build Orders, and Classic Strategies and Counterplays\n(detailed in Appendix G). We used a double-blind evaluation, with both Grandmaster-level human\nexperts and GPT-4 assessing the responses to ensure unbiased scoring.\nEvaluation Results: Both human experts and GPT-4 assessed the LLMs, illustrated in Figures 2 and\nTable 6, leading to the following insights: In the evaluation of LLMs on a set of complex questions,\nGPT-4 and ChatGPT demonstrated the best performance, with GPT-4 receiving high scores from\nboth itself and human experts. Claude2 had mixed results, with GPT-4 rating it higher than human\nexperts did. Bard struggled with the complex questions, receiving the lowest scores, especially on\nquestions 3, 4, and 5. Overall, the LLMs were ranked as follows: GPT-4, ChatGPT, Claude2, and\nBard. It is worth noting that GPT-4’s self-assessment showed more variability compared to the more\nbalanced evaluations provided by human experts.\n7\nTable 3: Match Results: Finetuned Qwen1.8B vs Human.\nHUMAN PLAYER\nRANK\nMMR\nRESULT\nPLAYER A\nPRO GAMER\n5918\n0\/10\nPLAYER B\nGRANDMASTER\n5001\n0\/10\nPLAYER C\nGOLD\n2556\n5\/10\nPLAYER D\nNEW PLAYER\n\/\n10\/10\n5.3\nHuman-AI Interaction\nFollowing insights from Section 5.1, we evaluated the fine-tuned Qwen1.8B model’s real-time\ninteraction with human players on home PCs, requiring only 4GB of GPU memory. This model faced\nhuman players of varied skills from the Asian server, including a Grandmaster, a Gold-level player,\nand a novice, all playing as Zerg against the Protoss-configured LLM agent. Results, detailed in Table\n3, show the LLM agent achieving competitive performance, on par with a Gold-level player. This\nhighlights the LLM’s adaptability in strategic play and marks a significant step towards integrating\nAI into competitive gaming environments on accessible home computing setups.\n6\nAnalysis\n6.1\nImpact of Different Prompts\nIn evaluating the Chain of Summarization method using the GPT3.5-turbo-16k model in TextStarCraft\nII, we analyzed the effects of two different prompt types on LLM agent performance when playing as\nProtoss against Zerg. The results, detailed in Table 4, showed a notable improvement in performance\nwith more complex prompts.\nTable 4: LLM Agent Win Rates (%) vs. TextStarCraft II AI at Varied Difficulty Levels.\nPROMPT\nLV1\nLV2\nLV3\nLV4\nLV5\nLV6\nPROMPT 1\n87.50\n66.67\n25.00\n12.50\n0.00\n0.00\nPROMPT 2\n100.00\n100.00\n100.00\n84.00\n50.00\n8.33\nSimple Thought Chain:\nUsing a basic prompt (see Prompt 1), the LLM agent could perform\nelementary operations like worker production, base establishment, and basic combat unit production.\nHowever, this approach was limited in developing advanced strategies, such as research upgrades or\ncomprehensive game analysis, indicating a narrower strategic depth with simpler prompts.\nComplex Thought Chain:\nA more intricate prompt (see Prompt 2) guided the LLM agent through\na series of critical phases, including situation overview, analysis, strategic planning, and decision-\nmaking. This comprehensive approach enabled the agent to engage in advanced strategies like research\nupgrades, tech tree exploration, and complex military maneuvers. It proved particularly effective\nagainst higher difficulty levels (e.g., \"Harder\" lv 5 ), showcasing enhanced strategic capabilities.\nOur analysis underscores the importance of complex prompts that replicate the thought processes of\nseasoned StarCraft II players. These advanced prompts are essential for LLMs to fully understand\nand strategically engage in the sophisticated aspects of the game.\n6.2\nPolicy Interpretability\nOur analysis reveals a stark contrast in decision-making between AlphaStar and our LLM agent.\nWhile AlphaStar demonstrates superior micromanagement skills, it occasionally lacks rationality in\nits strategic choices. Conversely, the LLM agent consistently exhibits logical decision-making, as\nevidenced by its proactive anticipation of threats and strategic planning, detailed in Appendix E and\nAppendix F.\nAnticipating Threats:\nFigure 3 illustrates a stark contrast between AlphaStar and the LLM agent\nin their ability to anticipate and respond to potential threats. In Figure 3.a, AlphaStar overlooks the\nimpending danger posed by enemy Oracles, failing to recognize the need for adequate defensive\n8\nProtoss sky \nharassment \nunit: oracle\nZerg anti-air \nbuilding\nZerg anti-air \nbuilding\n(a) Alphastar failed to construct preemptive defen-\nsive structures such as Spore Crawlers to prevent\nOracle incursions by the MasterPlayer, resulting in\ninadequate defensive capabilities against the Oracle\nharassment.\nThe Protoss defensive \nstructure Shield Battery\nThe Shield Battery \nhas just been \nconstructed\nProtoss base nexus\nThe Zerg unit \nRavager\n(b) The LLM agent demonstrated proactive defense\nmeasures by constructing Shield Batteries ahead of\ntime, indicating its proactive awareness and prepared-\nness for defensive strategies.\nFigure 3: The ability to construct defensive structures and anticipate dangers in advance: Alphastar\n(left) vs. LLM agent (right).\nstructures. This oversight leaves AlphaStar’s base vulnerable to a devastating attack, highlighting\nits inability to proactively assess and mitigate potential risks. Conversely, in Figure 3.b, the LLM\nagent demonstrates remarkable foresight by analyzing the enemy’s strategy and recommending\nappropriate defensive measures. The agent’s log data at 05:00 game time reveals its ability to infer\nthe enemy’s Roach-centric strategy based on the presence of key structures such as the Roach Warren\nand Spawning Pool. Armed with this insight, the LLM agent provides a structured decision-making\nframework to address the identified threat:\n• Enemy’s Strategy: The enemy has established a Hatchery, Roach Warren, Extrac-\ntor, and Spawning Pool. This indicates a potential strategy centered around Roach\nproduction and early aggression.\n• Given the enemy’s potential for early aggression with Roaches, we should prioritize\ndefensive structures such as Photon Cannons and Shield Batteries. Additionally,\nconsider scouting the enemy base to gather more information about their strategy.\n• Decisions:0: <BUILD PHOTONCANNON> 1: <BUILD SHIELDBATTERY>\nFlexible Unit Composition:\nAlphaStar often adheres to fixed unit compositions, leading to inef-\nfective strategies in dynamic scenarios (Figure 13.a-d). In contrast, the LLM agent demonstrates\nadaptability in unit selection, effectively countering varied enemy tactics (Figure 13.e-h). For instance,\nin Figure 13.f, the Zerg (Built-in AI) employs a Hydra-Roach composition. The LLM agent, playing\nas Protoss in 09:00, recognizes the need to adapt its strategy based on the enemy’s ground-based\narmy. The agent’s thought process, as shown in the log, reveals its ability to analyze the situation and\nmake informed decisions:\n• Enemy’s Strategy: The enemy seems to be focusing on a ground-based army composi-\ntion, consisting of Roaches, Swarm hosts and Hydralisks.\n• Key Information: The most important aspect at this moment is our need to expand\nour unit composition and technology tree to counter the enemy’s strategy effectively.\nWe should prioritize unlocking advanced units and upgrades to gain an advantage.\nConsider researching psionic storm at the Templar Archives to deal with the enemy’s\nground units effectively.\n• Decisions: 4: <RESEARCH PSISTORMTECH>\nThe LLM agent’s superior performance in threat anticipation and unit composition adaptability stems\nfrom its structured, transparent decision-making process. By analyzing the situation, identifying\nkey information, and making informed decisions based on the evolving game state, the LLM agent\ndemonstrates a blend of human knowledge and logical reasoning. This approach enhances the\n9\ninterpretability of the agent’s gameplay, facilitating better collaboration and strategic adaptation in\ncomplex scenarios, ultimately leading to more successful outcomes compared to AlphaStar’s opaque\nstrategies.\n7\nDiscussion\nTextStarCraft II enhances the use of LLMs for strategic decision-making in StarCraft II, showcasing\ntheir capabilities in adaptive strategy and crisis management. However, the framework’s reliance\non rule-based scripts for micro policies, limitation to non-visual data, and a subset of the game’s\nraces may restrict the diversity and applicability of AI strategies. Additionally, resource limitations\nhave constrained the performance capabilities of our system. Despite these challenges, TextStarCraft\nII establishes a new benchmark in RTS games, promoting deeper AI-human collaborative research.\nFuture improvements will focus on integrating visual inputs, expanding race support, and optimizing\nresource usage to enhance strategic complexity and performance against established AI models.\n```\n\n#### 5. 学生问题\n问题1：介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」\n问题2：这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？\n问题3：这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？\n\n\n请输出论文总结\n### 输出格式（输出语言用中文）\n```\n## 💡 解答问题1 (...复述学生问题1...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (...复述学生问题2...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (...复述学生问题3...)\n...\n```\n","llm_summary_res":"## 🌟 论文解读 | 大型语言模型在星际争霸II中的表现：基准测试与摘要链方法\n\n## 📌 背景痛点\/本文动机\n星际争霸II（StarCraft II）是一款极具挑战性的实时战略游戏，要求玩家在微观操作和宏观战略规划之间取得平衡。尽管之前的AI研究，如AlphaStar和SCC，在星际争霸II中取得了令人印象深刻的成果，但它们在长期战略规划和策略可解释性方面仍存在不足。随着大型语言模型（LLM）在解决复杂任务方面的潜力日益显现，本文旨在验证LLM在星际争霸II中的能力。\n\n## 🚀 核心方法\n💡 创新点1：TextStarCraft II环境\n为了充分利用LLM的推理能力，本文开发了一个名为TextStarCraft II的文本环境，LLM代理可以与之交互。该环境将星际争霸II的复杂游戏动态转换为文本格式，允许LLM代理通过语言命令执行宏观战略行动。\n\n💡 创新点2：摘要链（CoS）方法\n本文提出了摘要链（CoS）方法，包括单帧摘要和多帧摘要。单帧摘要用于处理原始观察数据，而多帧摘要用于分析游戏信息，提供命令建议并生成战略决策。CoS方法通过信息压缩、推理加速和全局理解，增强了LLM代理在处理复杂信息和做出战略决策方面的能力。\n\n## 📈 实验结果\n实验结果表明，LLM具备解决星际争霸II场景所需的相关知识和复杂规划能力。人类专家认为，LLM代理在游戏中的表现接近于玩了八年星际争霸II的平均玩家。此外，LLM代理能够在Harder（Lv5）难度级别下击败内置AI。\n\n## 💬 可借鉴之处\n本文提出的TextStarCraft II环境和CoS方法为评估LLM在实时战略决策和长期规划方面的能力提供了一个新的基准。此外，本文的研究结果表明，LLM在解决复杂任务方面具有巨大潜力，并为未来在星际争霸II和其他实时战略游戏中的AI研究提供了有价值的见解。","llm_summary_res_status":200,"order":6,"query_answer":"## 💡 解答问题1 (介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」)\n\n这篇论文提出的benchmark是TextStarCraft II，这是一个专门为评估大型语言模型（LLM）在星际争霸II中的实时战略决策和长期规划能力而设计的文本环境。TextStarCraft II利用python-sc2框架将星际争霸II的复杂游戏动态转换为文本格式，允许LLM代理通过语言命令执行宏观战略行动。这个环境填补了现有星际争霸II环境中缺乏语言支持的空白，为评估LLM在实时战略决策和长期规划方面的能力提供了一个新的基准。\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？)\n\n论文中提到，TextStarCraft II环境在家庭PC上进行了测试，只需要4GB的GPU内存。这意味着这个benchmark可以在相对低配置的设备上运行。至于模型训练和推理所使用的设备，论文中并没有明确说明。但是，根据论文中提到的实验结果，可以推测模型训练可能需要较高配置的设备，例如多GPU服务器，而推理则可以在家庭PC上进行。\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？)\n\nTextStarCraft II环境提供了一个奖励函数R，用于将代理行为与游戏目标对齐。该奖励函数根据比赛结果（输、平、赢）分别赋予{-1, 0, 1}的值。这种奖励机制可以有效地评估代理在游戏中的表现，并鼓励代理采取有利于获胜的策略。然而，论文中并没有详细说明奖励函数的具体设计，因此无法确定它是否能够完全避免reward hacking。尽管如此，TextStarCraft II环境为RL类模型提供了一个新的测试平台，有助于推动实时战略决策和长期规划方面的研究。","query_answer_status":200}

Introduction\nHousehold robots able to sense and act in the physi-\ncal world remain an important goal of the computer vision\nand robotics communities. Because directly training mod-\nels with real robots is expensive and involves safety risks,\nthere has been a trend toward incorporating simulators to\ntrain and evaluate AI algorithms. In recent years, the devel-\nopment of 3D virtual environments [25, 47, 31, 48, 15] that\ncan simulate photo-realistic scenes has served as the major\ndriving force for the progress of vision-based robot naviga-\ntion [52, 20, 7, 1, 28, 33, 10].\nMost tasks deﬁned thus far in these virtual environments\nprimarily focus on visual navigation in high-quality syn-\nthetic scenes [34] and real-world RGB-D scans [6, 47],\nand thus pay little or no attention to physical interaction.\nSince the ultimate goal of Embodied AI is to develop sys-\ntems that can perceive and act in physical environments,\nit has become increasingly apparent that physical interac-\ntion is a necessary component for the training of home as-\nsistant robots. Recent work has aimed to improve sim-to-\nreal transfer in the physical world by developing 3D virtual\nenvironments with both photo-realistic rendering and high-\nﬁdelity physics simulations (e.g. iGibson [46], TDW [15]\nand SAPIEN [48]). iGibson [46, 45] made initial progress\nin this area, introducing an interactive navigation task with\npartial observations in a 3D cluttered environment.\nAn\nagent with a mobile manipulator was encouraged to take\ninteractive action (e.g. pushing obstacles away and opening\na door) to navigate towards the goal position. But the task\nitself was still a relatively simple navigation task, and did\nnot explicitly require agents to change object states.\nIn this paper, we propose a new embodied AI challenge:\nan agent must take actions to move and change the state\nof a large number of objects to fulﬁll a complex goal in a\nphoto- and physically-realistic virtual environment. In our\nchallenge, an embodied agent equipped with two 9-DOF ar-\nticulated arms is spawned randomly in a physically-realistic\nvirtual house environment. The agent is required to explore\nthe house, searching for a small set of objects scattered in\ndifferent rooms, and transporting them to a desired ﬁnal lo-\ncation, as shown in Fig.1. We also position various contain-\ners around the house; the agent can ﬁnd these containers\nand place objects into them. Without using a container as\na tool, the agent can only transport up to two objects at a\ntime. However, using a container, the agent can collect sev-\neral objects and transport them together.\nWe build our challenge using ThreeDWorld (TDW) [15],\nan interactive physical simulation platform. We ﬁrst cre-\nate a TDW-based house dataset of multi-room environments\nﬁlled with objects that respond to physics. We further de-\nvelop a fully physics-driven high-level navigation and inter-\naction API that we can use to train AI agents to physically\ninteract with the virtual world. The embodied agent needs to\npick up, move and drop objects using physics to drive a set\nof joints; this is fundamentally different from the approach\ntaken by AI2-THOR [25] and VirtualHome [27], where ob-\njects close to the agent simply “attach” to it or are animated\nto move into position, with no physical interaction at all.\nWe believe that such a long-horizon task in the physically\nrealistic environment poses several challenges for embod-\nied agents beyond semantic exploration of unknown envi-\nronments, including:\n• Synergy between navigation and interaction.\nThe\nagent cannot move to grasp an object if this object is\nnot in the egocentric view, or if the direct path to it is\nobstructed (e.g. by a table).\n• Physics-aware Interaction. Grasping might fail if the\nagent’s arm cannot reach an object.\n• Physics-aware navigation. Collision with obstacles\nmight cause objects to be dropped and signiﬁcantly im-\npede the transport efﬁciency.\n• Reasoning about tool usage. While the containers\nhelp the agent transport more than two items, it also\ntakes some time to ﬁnd them. The agent thus has to\nreason about a case-by-case optimal plan.\nWe evaluate several existing agents on this benchmark.\nExperimental results suggest that existing state-of-the-art\nmodels for embodied intelligence all struggle to complete\nthis task efﬁciently. We believe models that perform well on\nour transport challenge will enable more intelligent robots\nthat can function in the real physical world. Our contribu-\ntions are summarized as follow:\n• We introduce a new embodied AI task that aims to\nmeasure AI agents’ ability to change the states of mul-\ntiple objects to accomplish a complex task in a photo-\nand physically-realistic virtual environment.\n• We have developed a fully physics-driven high-level\ncommand API that enables agents to execute interac-\ntive actions in this simulated physical world.\n• We evaluate several agents and ﬁnd that a pure RL\nmodel struggles to succeed at the challenge task. The\nhierarchical planning-based agent achieves better per-\nformance but still far from solving this task.\n2. Related Work\nOur challenge builds on prior work on 3D interactive\nenvironments, embodied intelligence and task-and-motion\nplanning.\n2.1. 3D Interactive Environments\nRecently, the development of 3D interactive environ-\nments, including AI2-THOR[25], HoME [44], Virtual-\nHome [27], Habitat [31], Gibson [47], Deepmind Lab [4],\nRoboTHOR [14], SAPIEN [48], and TDW [15] have fa-\ncilitated novel algorithms in visual navigation [52, 31, 28],\nvisual-language navigation [1, 41, 33], embodied question\nanswering [13, 19] and other tasks.\nThere are several stand-alone physics engines widely\nused in the robotics community, including PyBullet [12],\nMuJuCo [38], and V-REP [29]. Many robotic manipulation\nand physical reasoning challenges are also built on top of\nthese engines ( e.g. RL-Benchmark [21], Meta-World [51]\nand CLEVRER [50, 11]). However, these platforms can-\nnot render photo-realistic images, limiting the visual per-\nception abilities of systems trained therein. Most recently,\nphysics-based simulators with realistic images and physics\nhave been introduced [48, 46, 15], aiming to reduce the\nsim-to-real gaps seen when deploying trained systems in the\nphysical world. However, we still lack challenging embod-\nied AI benchmarks with a clear task and evaluation metric\nthat require an agent to move and change multiple object\nstates for a long-horizon task. We hope to ﬁll this gap with\nthe ThreeDWorld Transport Challenge. Our challenge in-\nvolves complex physical scene understanding and a long-\nhorizon task and can serve as a benchmark for running and\ntesting embodied agents’ task-and-motion planning abilities\nin 3D simulated physical home environments.\n2.2. Embodied Intelligence\nThe training of embodied agents in 3D virtual environ-\nments has generated increasing interest within the computer\nvision and robotics communities.\nPopular tasks include\npoint-goal navigation [31], audio-visual navigation [16, 9],\nvision-language navigation [1], and semantic-goal naviga-\ntion [8]. However, a majority of these navigation tasks are\ncollision-free and do not involve much physical interaction.\nInspired by early work on Navigation Among Movable\nObjects (NAMO) [36, 37, 40, 40], iGibson [46] introduced\nan interactive navigation task in a cluttered 3D environ-\nment. In [46], an agent is encouraged to push movable ob-\njects with non-prehensile manipulators to clear a path to aid\nnavigation. In [45], more complicated interactive naviga-\ntion tasks (e.g. open a door) and a few mobile manipulation\ntasks (e.g. kitchen rearrangement) are developed. However,\nin both cases, the tasks have a shorter horizon and involve\nlimited physical constraints compared with ours. We aimed\nto use a more advanced physical virtual environment simu-\nlator to deﬁne a new embodied AI task requiring an agent\nto change the states of multiple objects under realistic phys-\nical constraints. Perhaps the closest challenge task to that\nproposed here is a recently introduced Animal AI Olympic\nchallenge [5]. This challenge aims to test AI reasoning and\nplanning abilities in a Unity game engine. However, the\nembodied agent is restricted to navigation actions, and does\nnot contain interactive actions that are important for build-\ning household robots. Our new benchmark goes beyond\nthese existing challenge datasets by requiring the agents to\nchange multiple object states in a rich and realistic physical\nworld. Hierarchical reasoning and planning abilities in the\nface of realistic physics constraints are necessary to succeed\nat our task.\nCurrent state-of-the-art methods on embodied tasks\nmainly fall into two broad categories: end-to-end training of\nneural policies using RL [52, 26] or hierarchical RL [24, 2]\nand map building for path planning [20, 30, 7]. We believe\nthat the proposed ThreeDWorld transport challenge could\nprovide new opportunities to develop novel algorithms that\ncombine visual perception, reasoning and hierarchical plan-\nning to solve more challenging tasks in the physical world.\n2.3. Task and Motion Planning\nOur work falls in the domain of task and motion planning\n(TAMP) [22, 23, 18, 42], recently reviewed in [17]. The\ngoal of TAMP is to operate a robot in environments con-\ntaining a large number of objects, taking actions to move\nand change the state of the objects in order to fulﬁll a goal.\nA task planner is responsible for reasoning over the large set\nof states of the environment, and a motion planner computes\na path to accomplish the task.\nTAMP has demonstrated\nits power in many mobile manipulation tasks [43, 35]. In\nour work, we hope to create a visually guided TAMP-like\nchallenge that requires robots to carry out a complex and\nlong-horizon task involving physical interaction in a clut-\ntered 3D environment. Rearrangement of objects in an en-\nvironment has recently been proposed as a potential test\nbed for embodied AI [3].\nOur work provides an exam-\nple rearrangement challenge with a visually guided task-\nand-motion planning benchmark in a photo- and physically-\nrealistic virtual environment.\n3. ThreeDWorld Transport Challenge\nThe ThreeDWorld Transport challenge aims to assess\nan AI agent’s reasoning and planning abilities in a physi-\ncal realistic environment. We build this challenge on top\nof the TDW platform [15], which is a general-purpose vir-\ntual world simulation platform supporting both near-photo-\nrealistic image rendering, physically-based sound render-\ning [39], and realistic physical interactions between objects\nand agents.\nTDW enables the training of embodied agents to per-\nform tasks in a simulated 3D physical world. To support\nsuch training, we created 15 physically-simulated houses\nﬁlled with objects that respond to physics.\nWe also de-\nveloped a high-level fully physics-driven navigation and in-\nteraction API. An agent equipped with an RGB-D camera\nand an oracle visual perception model can navigate through\nthe virtual physical world to transport objects. Since the\nsimulated actions and environment are fully physics-based,\nthey pose additional challenges compared to previous non-\nphysics [31, 25, 27] or partial-physics [46] virtual envi-\nronments. For instance, interactive action only succeeds if\nExample Task: Transport 1 vase, 2 bottle , 1 jug to a bed.\nObservation: RGB-D image, Segmentation Mask\nNavigation: Move Forward By, Rotate By\nInteraction: Go to Grasp, Put in Container, Drop\n(b) Third Person View\nEgocentric\nSegmentation\nDepth\n(c) Top Down View\n(a) Observation\n(d) Task Setup\nFigure 2: The details of ThreeDWorld Transport Challenge. (a) The observation state includes ﬁrst-person view RGB image,\nDepth image, and semantic segmentation mask; (b) and (c) are Third-person view, and top-down view of the environment\nrespectively; (d) Outline of the task and action space.\nthe target is physically reachable (i.e. close by and not ob-\nstructed). The agent can not successfully go to grasp an\nobject if this object is not in the egocentric view, or if the\ndirect path to it is obstructed (e.g. by a table). And physical\ncollisions with objects in the house might also signiﬁcantly\nimpede transport progress. Therefore, the agent must learn\nto leverage visual signals to synchronize navigation and ma-\nnipulation under these physical constraints.\n3.1. Problem Formulation\nAs shown in Figure 2, an embodied agent is required\nto transport a set of predeﬁned objects to a target location.\nThere are three types of objects that the agent needs to pay\nattention to:\n• Target objects: objects the agent needs to grasp and\ntransport, placed at various locations in the house.\n• Containers: objects that can be used as tools to as-\nsist with the transport of target objects, also located in\nvarious rooms.\n• Goal position:\na goal area is deﬁned around one\nunique object (e.g, a bed) in the house.\nThe objective of this task is to transport as many objects\nas possible, given a limited interaction budget. The robot\nagent can only transport two objects with their arms, but it\ncan transport more with the container. In each task instance,\nthe target object positions and the object list for transport\nare varied, so the agent must learn how to explore the home\nenvironment to ﬁnd target objects, containers, and goal po-\nsitions. They can then plan a sequence of actions to trans-\nport the target objects to their desired location. Since both\nthe objects in the room and high-level actions are respon-\nsive to physics, the robot agent needs to learn to use vision\nto decide when to go to grasp objects that can be success-\nfully reached while avoiding collisions (e.g. objects and\/or\nthe container might fall if the agent collides with obstacles)\nunder the realistic physic constraints.\n3.2. Scenes\nWe have created a TDW-House dataset to support this\nchallenge. As shown in Figure 2 (c), each house environ-\nment contains between 6 and 8 interconnected rooms such\nas bedrooms, living rooms, and kitchens. These rooms are\nfully populated with furniture and other items (see “Ob-\njects” below). The agent’s view might be blocked by ob-\nstacles such as walls, so it needs to explore the house in\norder to predict a full occupancy map of the scenes.\nThe dataset is modular in its design, comprising several\nphysical ﬂoor plan geometries with wall and ﬂoor material\nvariations (e.g. parquet ﬂooring, ceramic tile, stucco, carpet\netc.) and various furniture and prop layouts (tables, chairs,\ncabinets etc.), for a total of 15 separate environments. Fur-\nniture arrangements were interactively laid out by a 3D\nartist using 3D assets from the TDW model library [15].\nWe will make this dataset publicly available.\n3.3. Objects\nTo build physical house environments for the agent to\nnavigate, we also populated the various ﬂoor plans with\naround 50 categories of objects.\nThese include typical\nhousehold items like lamps, toys, vases, pillows, printers,\nand laptops. Except for non-movable objects like walls, all\nobjects respond to physics, so the embodied agent can in-\nteract with them.\n3.4. Embodiment\nWe use the Magnebot as an embodied agent. The Mag-\nnebot is equipped with an RGB-D camera and also capable\nof returning image masks for object ID segmentation, se-\nmantic segmentation, normals and pixel ﬂow. For interac-\ntions with scene objects, the avatar has two articulated arms\nwith 9-DOF “magnet” end-effectors for picking up objects\n(see supplementary material for details). All motion and\narm articulation actions are fully physics-driven.\nThe observation space in this challenge contains a ﬁrst-\nperson view RGB image, a depth map, and a semantic seg-\nmentation mask. The agent could use these observations to\nestimate the occupancy map (see below). And it can also\nobtain an object list based on the semantic segmentation\nmask.\n3.5. Action space\nWe developed a high-level API with action commands\ndesigned to ﬁt our task deﬁnitions, enabling an agent to\nmove and manipulate objects.\nOur design choices were\nintended to abstract away the details of low-level control,\nwhich could otherwise form a barrier to exploring novel so-\nlutions for this kind of TAMP-style embodied AI challenge.\nThere are two types of actions we consider in this trans-\nport challenge: navigation and interactive actions.\nAPI\nfunctions for navigation include Move Forward By (x m),\nRotate By (θ degrees), Rotate To (an object or target posi-\ntion). In our experiments, we make the actions discrete by\nsetting x = 0.5meter, θ = ±15◦. Rotate to +15◦and Ro-\ntate to −15◦means to rotate left or right by 15 degrees, re-\nspectively. Interactive action functions include Go to Grasp,\nDrop and Put In Container. Taking as an example a simple\ntask that involves the agent selecting an object to pick up\nbased on the segmentation mask returned by sensors, going\nto grasping it, then moving to a container and dropping the\nobject into the container, the action sequence we applied is\nGo to Grasp (object), Go To Grasp (container), and Put In\nContainer. We use Inverse Kinematics to implement these\ninteractive actions. The details can be found in the supple-\nmentary materials.\nSince our high-level action API is fully physics-driven,\nthese features also pose new challenges that have not ap-\npeared in previous navigation environments, but indeed ex-\nist in the real physical world. For example, the agent might\nfail to grasp one target object when we apply a Go to Grasp\naction. The reason might be that its arm cannot reach the\ntarget object. In this case, the agent needs to move close to\nthe object and make an attempt again. We also observe that\nthe objects\/container held by the avatar can fall off if they\nhit a heavy obstacle during the navigation. The agent would\nthen have to ﬁnd and pick up these items again. 3433\n3.6. Action Status\nWhen performing tasks, the simulation will also provide\nfeedback on its status and the status of its current action, in\norder to decide what action to take next. Each API func-\ntion returns an ActionStatus value indicating the status of\nthe agent – whether it is performing an action, succeeded\nat an action, or failed to complete the action. There are 18\ntypes of action status, including: whether a target object is\ntoo close or too far to reach, or is behind the agent; whether\nthe agent succeeded or failed to pick up an object, or over-\nshot the target; whether the agent collided with something\nheavy or is obstructed by an obstacle, etc. We can use these\nmeta data to deﬁne a reward function for policy learning or\npriors for planning.\n3.7. Dataset Generation\nTarget Objects The objects that the agent needs to transport\nas part of the challenge task are known as “target objects”.\nThese objects are located at “target positions” within the\nenvironment, guaranteed to be reachable by the agent. The\nset of target objects to be transported are randomly placed\nacross different rooms. In addition, there is a 25% chance\nof spawning a container at a traversable position in each\nroom. When a scene is initialized, the simulation loads a\npre-calculated “occupancy map”, i.e. a data ﬁle represent-\ning grid spaces occupied by objects.\nGoal Positions The locations within the environment where\ntarget objects must be deposited to complete the task are\nknown as “goal positions”.\nThe surfaces that target ob-\njects are to be deposited on are known as “goal position\nsurfaces”. Goal position surfaces can be on any of the fol-\nlowing furniture objects: Sofa, Bench, Table, Coffee table,\nand Bed. For each task, we set one unique piece of furniture\nin the scene as the goal position (e.g. only one coffee table,\nor one sofa in the house) in the TDW-House dataset.\nRobot Agent Initialization After the scene conﬁguration\nis initialized, the robot agent is spawned at an open location\nthat is free of other objects.\nTask Deﬁnition We deﬁne the goal of each task with two\ncomponents: 1) a set of objects and their counts, 2) the Goal\nPosition. For instance, “vase:2, bowl:2, jug:1; bed” means\nthat the agent must transport 2 vases, 2 toys, and 1 jug to the\nbed. There are ﬁve types of objects used as potential target\nobjects to be transported. Each task requires transporting 6\nto 8 objects.\nUnseen Home\nSeen Home\nFigure 3: Example layouts of seen and unseen houses.\n4. Experiments\nIn this section, we discuss our experimental setup, base-\nlines, implementation details and evaluation results.\n4.1. Experimental Setup\nSetup. We use 15 physically distinct houses for the exper-\niments. Example house layouts can be found in Figure 3.\nSince this challenge aims to test the agent’s generalization\nabilities, we split them into 10 seen houses (training) and\n5 unseen houses (test). We generated 100 tasks for each\nseen house and 20 tasks for each unseen house by randomly\nplacing target objects and containers into different rooms as\ndescribed above (for a total of 1000 training and 100 test\ntasks). We report the models’ performance on the test set\ntasks.\nEvaluation Metrics. The objective of this challenge is to\ntransport the maximum number of objects as efﬁciently as\npossible. We use the transport rate as an evaluation metric.\nThe transport rate is the fraction of the objects successfully\ntransported to the desired position within a given interaction\nbudget (deﬁned as a maximum episode length in steps). For\ntesting we set this maximum episode length to 1000 steps.\n4.2. Baseline Models\nWe implemented several baseline agents using both\nlearning- and planning-based algorithms. We found em-\npirically that it was difﬁcult for an end-to-end RL learning\nmodel (Pure RL baseline) to take observation data as input\nand directly search for an optimal policy over the agent’s ac-\ntion space, presumably because our task is very challenging\n(e.g. long-horizon, partial observability, involving complex\nphysical interaction, sparse rewards, etc.). Therefore, we\nimplemented additional baselines using a hierarchical plan-\nning framework with different exploration strategies.\nAs shown in Figure 4, we deﬁne four types of sub-goals\nfor this task: exploration, pick up a container, pick up an\nobject, and place. We use a rule-based high-level planner to\ndecide when to transition between sub-goals. For the explo-\nration sub-goal, the agent will either directly use the policy\nto navigate around the environment (RL Exploration base-\nline) or plan a shortest path from the current location to the\nwaypoints (Active, Frontier and Semantic Exploration base-\nlines). The agent can accumulate RGB images, depth maps,\nand segmentation masks to construct a 2D occupancy map\nand a semantic map during its exploration. When setting\nthe sub-goal as pick up a container or pick up an object,\nthe agent will plan a sequence of actions to move towards\na container or a target object and pick it up. For the place\nsub-goal, the agent uses a planner to generate a determinis-\ntic local policy to go to the goal position and drop the target\nobjects. We summarize the baseline models as follows:\n• Pure RL: We train an end-to-end RL policy using PPO\nby maximizing the reward of ﬁnding objects (either\ntarget objects, containers, or the goal position), grasp-\ning objects, putting objects into a container, and drop-\nping them onto the goal location. This model takes the\ninputs of observation and estimated occupancy map\nand directly outputs actions that the agent should ex-\necute in the environment.\n• RL Exploration: We train a policy network that max-\nimizes occupancy map coverage. The network yields\nan action to execute.\n• Frontier Exploration: Similar to [49], the agent uses\ndepth images and semantic segmentation masks to\nconstruct an occupancy map and a semantic map of\nthe scene. The agent randomly samples a waypoint\nfrom an unexplored area as a sub-goal for exploration.\nIt marks the location of target objects, containers, and\nthe goal position on its semantic map.\n• Active Exploration: We adapted a baseline from [7].\nInstead of randomly choosing an unexplored position\nin the occupancy map as a goal location to explore (as\nin the Frontier baseline), the Active baseline learns a\ngoal-agnostic policy by maximizing map coverage (us-\ning neural SLAM). The output is a waypoint position.\nThe local exploration planner uses this waypoint as a\nsub-goal.\n• Semantic Exploration:\nWe adapted a baseline\nfrom [8]. The Semantic baseline uses neural SLAM\nto learn an object\/goal-oriented “semantic” exploration\npolicy. The reward function encourages the agent to\nHigh-level Planner\nRL Exploration\nActive Exploration\nFrontier Exploration\nSemantic Exploration\nexploration\nExploration\nPick up an object\nPick up a container\nPlace\nSub-goal\nFigure 4: The ﬂowchart of high-level and low-level planners.\nHouse 1\nHouse 2\nHouse 3\nHouse 4\nHouse 5\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\nTransport Rate\nPure RL\nRL Exploration\nFrontier Exploration\nActive Exploration\nSemantic Exploration\nFigure 5: Comparisons of transport rates in each unseen room.\nﬁnd more target objects, containers, and the goal posi-\ntion.\n4.3. Implementation Details\nFor all the baselines, the input observation data are 256 ×\n256 size RGB images, depth maps, and semantic segmenta-\ntion masks. The action spaces include 3 navigation actions\n(i.e. move forward, rotate left, and rotate right) and 3 inter-\nactive actions (i.e. go to grasp, put in container, and drop).\nBelow we provide the details of the occupancy map, seman-\ntic map, policy training, high-level and low-level planners.\nOccupancy Map. We represent the global top-down occu-\npancy map as Og ∈R2×N×N, where N×N denotes the map\nsize and each element in this occupancy map corresponds\nto a region of size 0.25m×0.25m in the physical world. We\ncan recover a local occupancy map Ol ∈R2×K×K from\negocentric depth map, which comprises a local area in front\nof the camera. The two channels in each cell represent the\nprobability scores of the cell being occupied and explored,\nrespectively. We considered a cell to be occupied if there\nis an obstacle and a cell to be explored if the agent already\nknows whether it is occupied or not. The occupancy map is\ninitialized with all zeros and the agent always starts at the\ncenter of the map at the beginning of each episode.\nSemantic Map. Similar to the occupancy map, we can also\nconstruct a global top-down semantic map S ∈R3×N×N\nusing both depth images and semantic segmentation masks.\nThe value in each channel indicates if a cell contains target\nobjects, containers or goal position. Similar to the occu-\npancy map, we also initialized the semantic map with all\nzeros and set the agent starting position as the map center.\nThe agent can gradually update the semantic map when they\nﬁnd objects during the navigation exploration.\nPolicy learning. For all policy learning, we use a four-\nlayer CNN network and train for 10 million frames using\nProximal Policy Optimization [32]. In the Pure RL, RL\nExploration, and Semantic Exploration baselines, we take\nthe depth image, estimated occupancy map, and semantic\nmap as input. In the Active Exploration baseline, we take\nthe depth image and estimated occupancy map as inputs.\nIn the Pure RL and RL Exploration baselines, the model\ndirectly outputs an action. For Active and Semantic Ex-\nploration baselines, the models predict waypoints as sub-\ngoals. We use the same reward function for the Pure RL\nand Active Exploration baselines by encouraging the agent\nto ﬁnd new objects, grasp target objects, put objects into a\ncontainer, and drop objects onto the goal position. In the\nRL Exploration and Active Exploration baselines, we use a\ngoal-agnostic reward function by encouraging the agent to\nimprove the map coverage.\nHigh-level planner. We deﬁne a rule-based high-level plan-\nner to decide the sub-goal. The agent takes exploration as\na sub-goal by default. At the beginning, the sub-goal can\nswitch from exploration to picking up a container once a\ncontainer has been found. After a container is found or 20%\nof the interaction budget has been used up, the agent can\nswitch the sub-goal from exploration to picking up an ob-\nject if they ﬁnd a target object. After 90% of the interaction\nsteps, the agents will switch their sub-goal to place. If there\nis no container found, the agent will switch their sub-goal\nfrom picking up an object to place if they hold two objects.\nLow-level planner. We use a A-Star based planner to ﬁnd\nFigure 6: Navigation trajectories of frontier exploration (blue) against those of RL exploration (red). The frontier exploration\nﬁnds more efﬁcient routes to transport more objects.\nTable 1: Comparison of transport rate over 5 unseen rooms.\nMethod\nTransport Rate\nPure RL\n0.12±0.01\nRL Exploration\n0.33±0.02\nFrontier Exploration\n0.50±0.03\nActive Exploration\n0.51±0.01\nSemantic Exploration\n0.52±0.01\nthe shortest path from the current location to the sub-goal\nlocation and execute the high-level interactive actions for\nachieving the sub-goal. Every interaction steps, we update\nthe map and re-plan the path to the sub-goal.\n4.4. Result Analysis\nIn this section, we ﬁrst present the overall benchmark\nresults, and then perform in-depth analysis of the model de-\nsign. We hope that our experimental ﬁndings will provide\nuseful benchmarks for physically realistic Embodied AI.\nOverall Results. We ﬁrst plot the histogram of transport\nrate for all ﬁve unseen houses in Figure 5. We calculate the\nresults by averaging over all 20 testing tasks in each house.\nWe also summarize the overall quantitative evaluation re-\nsults of all baseline models measured by average transport\nrates of 5 unseen rooms in Table 1. The best model achieves\nan average of 0.52 transport rates under 1000 episodes. We\nhave two key observations: 1) There are no agents that can\nsuccessfully transport all the target objects to the goal lo-\ncations. This means our proposed task is very challenging\nand could be used as a benchmark to track the progress of\nembodied AI in physically realistic scenes. 2) The Pure\nRL baseline performs poorly. We believe this reﬂects the\ncomplexity of physical interaction and the large exploration\nsearch space of our benchmark. Compared to the previ-\nous point-goal navigation and semantic navigation tasks,\nwhere the agent only needs to navigate to speciﬁc coordi-\nnates or objects in the scene, the ThreeDWorld Transport\nchallenge requires agents to move and change the objects’\nphysical state in the environment(i.e. task-and-motion plan-\nning), which the end-to-end models might fall short on.\nExploration policy.\nThe results also indicate that com-\nbining RL exploration policy into a hierarchical planning\nframework could signiﬁcantly improve results over a purely\nRL-based approach (better performance of all Exploration\nbaselines over Pure RL). However, predicting a way-point\n(Frontier, Active, and Semantic Exploration) produced bet-\nter results than predicting an action (RL Exploration). We\nspeculate that RL Exploration can ﬁnd different positions,\nbut that it is hard for this model to learn complex physi-\ncal interactions. In practice, we observed that this agent\nalways failed to grasp objects, and frequently collided with\nthe obstacles, resulting in a low transport rate. These re-\nsults support the idea that our benchmark can enable novel\nalgorithms to combine learning-based and planning-based\nmethods to solve complex tasks in physically realistic envi-\nronments.\nNeural-based Exploration. We also found that learning\nto generate a waypoint for exploration (in the Active and\nSemantic Exploration baselines) did not show clear ad-\nvantages over the model without learning (Frontier Explo-\nration). The reasons might be two-fold: 1) the layout of\nour test scenes are quite different from those of the train-\ning scenes. 2) The occupancy and semantic maps used for\nlearning method do not convey much physics information.\nWe believe future work that explicitly incorporates physics\ninformation might help improve the generalization abilities\nof learning-based methods.\nQualitative Results.\nWe further visualize the trajectory\nof different agents in Figure 6. We can observe that the\nplanning-based agent using waypoints as sub-goals can al-\nways ﬁnd the shortest path to grasp objects and transport\nthem to the goal locations.

Introduction\nHousehold robots able to sense and act in the physi-\ncal world remain an important goal of the computer vision\nand robotics communities. Because directly training mod-\nels with real robots is expensive and involves safety risks,\nthere has been a trend toward incorporating simulators to\ntrain and evaluate AI algorithms. In recent years, the devel-\nopment of 3D virtual environments [25, 47, 31, 48, 15] that\ncan simulate photo-realistic scenes has served as the major\ndriving force for the progress of vision-based robot naviga-\ntion [52, 20, 7, 1, 28, 33, 10].\nMost tasks deﬁned thus far in these virtual environments\nprimarily focus on visual navigation in high-quality syn-\nthetic scenes [34] and real-world RGB-D scans [6, 47],\nand thus pay little or no attention to physical interaction.\nSince the ultimate goal of Embodied AI is to develop sys-\ntems that can perceive and act in physical environments,\nit has become increasingly apparent that physical interac-\ntion is a necessary component for the training of home as-\nsistant robots. Recent work has aimed to improve sim-to-\nreal transfer in the physical world by developing 3D virtual\nenvironments with both photo-realistic rendering and high-\nﬁdelity physics simulations (e.g. iGibson [46], TDW [15]\nand SAPIEN [48]). iGibson [46, 45] made initial progress\nin this area, introducing an interactive navigation task with\npartial observations in a 3D cluttered environment.\nAn\nagent with a mobile manipulator was encouraged to take\ninteractive action (e.g. pushing obstacles away and opening\na door) to navigate towards the goal position. But the task\nitself was still a relatively simple navigation task, and did\nnot explicitly require agents to change object states.\nIn this paper, we propose a new embodied AI challenge:\nan agent must take actions to move and change the state\nof a large number of objects to fulﬁll a complex goal in a\nphoto- and physically-realistic virtual environment. In our\nchallenge, an embodied agent equipped with two 9-DOF ar-\nticulated arms is spawned randomly in a physically-realistic\nvirtual house environment. The agent is required to explore\nthe house, searching for a small set of objects scattered in\ndifferent rooms, and transporting them to a desired ﬁnal lo-\ncation, as shown in Fig.1. We also position various contain-\ners around the house; the agent can ﬁnd these containers\nand place objects into them. Without using a container as\na tool, the agent can only transport up to two objects at a\ntime. However, using a container, the agent can collect sev-\neral objects and transport them together.\nWe build our challenge using ThreeDWorld (TDW) [15],\nan interactive physical simulation platform. We ﬁrst cre-\nate a TDW-based house dataset of multi-room environments\nﬁlled with objects that respond to physics. We further de-\nvelop a fully physics-driven high-level navigation and inter-\naction API that we can use to train AI agents to physically\ninteract with the virtual world. The embodied agent needs to\npick up, move and drop objects using physics to drive a set\nof joints; this is fundamentally different from the approach\ntaken by AI2-THOR [25] and VirtualHome [27], where ob-\njects close to the agent simply “attach” to it or are animated\nto move into position, with no physical interaction at all.\nWe believe that such a long-horizon task in the physically\nrealistic environment poses several challenges for embod-\nied agents beyond semantic exploration of unknown envi-\nronments, including:\n• Synergy between navigation and interaction.\nThe\nagent cannot move to grasp an object if this object is\nnot in the egocentric view, or if the direct path to it is\nobstructed (e.g. by a table).\n• Physics-aware Interaction. Grasping might fail if the\nagent’s arm cannot reach an object.\n• Physics-aware navigation. Collision with obstacles\nmight cause objects to be dropped and signiﬁcantly im-\npede the transport efﬁciency.\n• Reasoning about tool usage. While the containers\nhelp the agent transport more than two items, it also\ntakes some time to ﬁnd them. The agent thus has to\nreason about a case-by-case optimal plan.\nWe evaluate several existing agents on this benchmark.\nExperimental results suggest that existing state-of-the-art\nmodels for embodied intelligence all struggle to complete\nthis task efﬁciently. We believe models that perform well on\nour transport challenge will enable more intelligent robots\nthat can function in the real physical world. Our contribu-\ntions are summarized as follow:\n• We introduce a new embodied AI task that aims to\nmeasure AI agents’ ability to change the states of mul-\ntiple objects to accomplish a complex task in a photo-\nand physically-realistic virtual environment.\n• We have developed a fully physics-driven high-level\ncommand API that enables agents to execute interac-\ntive actions in this simulated physical world.\n• We evaluate several agents and ﬁnd that a pure RL\nmodel struggles to succeed at the challenge task. The\nhierarchical planning-based agent achieves better per-\nformance but still far from solving this task.\n2. Related Work\nOur challenge builds on prior work on 3D interactive\nenvironments, embodied intelligence and task-and-motion\nplanning.\n2.1. 3D Interactive Environments\nRecently, the development of 3D interactive environ-\nments, including AI2-THOR[25], HoME [44], Virtual-\nHome [27], Habitat [31], Gibson [47], Deepmind Lab [4],\nRoboTHOR [14], SAPIEN [48], and TDW [15] have fa-\ncilitated novel algorithms in visual navigation [52, 31, 28],\nvisual-language navigation [1, 41, 33], embodied question\nanswering [13, 19] and other tasks.\nThere are several stand-alone physics engines widely\nused in the robotics community, including PyBullet [12],\nMuJuCo [38], and V-REP [29]. Many robotic manipulation\nand physical reasoning challenges are also built on top of\nthese engines ( e.g. RL-Benchmark [21], Meta-World [51]\nand CLEVRER [50, 11]). However, these platforms can-\nnot render photo-realistic images, limiting the visual per-\nception abilities of systems trained therein. Most recently,\nphysics-based simulators with realistic images and physics\nhave been introduced [48, 46, 15], aiming to reduce the\nsim-to-real gaps seen when deploying trained systems in the\nphysical world. However, we still lack challenging embod-\nied AI benchmarks with a clear task and evaluation metric\nthat require an agent to move and change multiple object\nstates for a long-horizon task. We hope to ﬁll this gap with\nthe ThreeDWorld Transport Challenge. Our challenge in-\nvolves complex physical scene understanding and a long-\nhorizon task and can serve as a benchmark for running and\ntesting embodied agents’ task-and-motion planning abilities\nin 3D simulated physical home environments.\n2.2. Embodied Intelligence\nThe training of embodied agents in 3D virtual environ-\nments has generated increasing interest within the computer\nvision and robotics communities.\nPopular tasks include\npoint-goal navigation [31], audio-visual navigation [16, 9],\nvision-language navigation [1], and semantic-goal naviga-\ntion [8]. However, a majority of these navigation tasks are\ncollision-free and do not involve much physical interaction.\nInspired by early work on Navigation Among Movable\nObjects (NAMO) [36, 37, 40, 40], iGibson [46] introduced\nan interactive navigation task in a cluttered 3D environ-\nment. In [46], an agent is encouraged to push movable ob-\njects with non-prehensile manipulators to clear a path to aid\nnavigation. In [45], more complicated interactive naviga-\ntion tasks (e.g. open a door) and a few mobile manipulation\ntasks (e.g. kitchen rearrangement) are developed. However,\nin both cases, the tasks have a shorter horizon and involve\nlimited physical constraints compared with ours. We aimed\nto use a more advanced physical virtual environment simu-\nlator to deﬁne a new embodied AI task requiring an agent\nto change the states of multiple objects under realistic phys-\nical constraints. Perhaps the closest challenge task to that\nproposed here is a recently introduced Animal AI Olympic\nchallenge [5]. This challenge aims to test AI reasoning and\nplanning abilities in a Unity game engine. However, the\nembodied agent is restricted to navigation actions, and does\nnot contain interactive actions that are important for build-\ning household robots. Our new benchmark goes beyond\nthese existing challenge datasets by requiring the agents to\nchange multiple object states in a rich and realistic physical\nworld. Hierarchical reasoning and planning abilities in the\nface of realistic physics constraints are necessary to succeed\nat our task.\nCurrent state-of-the-art methods on embodied tasks\nmainly fall into two broad categories: end-to-end training of\nneural policies using RL [52, 26] or hierarchical RL [24, 2]\nand map building for path planning [20, 30, 7]. We believe\nthat the proposed ThreeDWorld transport challenge could\nprovide new opportunities to develop novel algorithms that\ncombine visual perception, reasoning and hierarchical plan-\nning to solve more challenging tasks in the physical world.\n2.3. Task and Motion Planning\nOur work falls in the domain of task and motion planning\n(TAMP) [22, 23, 18, 42], recently reviewed in [17]. The\ngoal of TAMP is to operate a robot in environments con-\ntaining a large number of objects, taking actions to move\nand change the state of the objects in order to fulﬁll a goal.\nA task planner is responsible for reasoning over the large set\nof states of the environment, and a motion planner computes\na path to accomplish the task.\nTAMP has demonstrated\nits power in many mobile manipulation tasks [43, 35]. In\nour work, we hope to create a visually guided TAMP-like\nchallenge that requires robots to carry out a complex and\nlong-horizon task involving physical interaction in a clut-\ntered 3D environment. Rearrangement of objects in an en-\nvironment has recently been proposed as a potential test\nbed for embodied AI [3].\nOur work provides an exam-\nple rearrangement challenge with a visually guided task-\nand-motion planning benchmark in a photo- and physically-\nrealistic virtual environment.\n3. ThreeDWorld Transport Challenge\nThe ThreeDWorld Transport challenge aims to assess\nan AI agent’s reasoning and planning abilities in a physi-\ncal realistic environment. We build this challenge on top\nof the TDW platform [15], which is a general-purpose vir-\ntual world simulation platform supporting both near-photo-\nrealistic image rendering, physically-based sound render-\ning [39], and realistic physical interactions between objects\nand agents.\nTDW enables the training of embodied agents to per-\nform tasks in a simulated 3D physical world. To support\nsuch training, we created 15 physically-simulated houses\nﬁlled with objects that respond to physics.\nWe also de-\nveloped a high-level fully physics-driven navigation and in-\nteraction API. An agent equipped with an RGB-D camera\nand an oracle visual perception model can navigate through\nthe virtual physical world to transport objects. Since the\nsimulated actions and environment are fully physics-based,\nthey pose additional challenges compared to previous non-\nphysics [31, 25, 27] or partial-physics [46] virtual envi-\nronments. For instance, interactive action only succeeds if\nExample Task: Transport 1 vase, 2 bottle , 1 jug to a bed.\nObservation: RGB-D image, Segmentation Mask\nNavigation: Move Forward By, Rotate By\nInteraction: Go to Grasp, Put in Container, Drop\n(b) Third Person View\nEgocentric\nSegmentation\nDepth\n(c) Top Down View\n(a) Observation\n(d) Task Setup\nFigure 2: The details of ThreeDWorld Transport Challenge. (a) The observation state includes ﬁrst-person view RGB image,\nDepth image, and semantic segmentation mask; (b) and (c) are Third-person view, and top-down view of the environment\nrespectively; (d) Outline of the task and action space.\nthe target is physically reachable (i.e. close by and not ob-\nstructed). The agent can not successfully go to grasp an\nobject if this object is not in the egocentric view, or if the\ndirect path to it is obstructed (e.g. by a table). And physical\ncollisions with objects in the house might also signiﬁcantly\nimpede transport progress. Therefore, the agent must learn\nto leverage visual signals to synchronize navigation and ma-\nnipulation under these physical constraints.\n3.1. Problem Formulation\nAs shown in Figure 2, an embodied agent is required\nto transport a set of predeﬁned objects to a target location.\nThere are three types of objects that the agent needs to pay\nattention to:\n• Target objects: objects the agent needs to grasp and\ntransport, placed at various locations in the house.\n• Containers: objects that can be used as tools to as-\nsist with the transport of target objects, also located in\nvarious rooms.\n• Goal position:\na goal area is deﬁned around one\nunique object (e.g, a bed) in the house.\nThe objective of this task is to transport as many objects\nas possible, given a limited interaction budget. The robot\nagent can only transport two objects with their arms, but it\ncan transport more with the container. In each task instance,\nthe target object positions and the object list for transport\nare varied, so the agent must learn how to explore the home\nenvironment to ﬁnd target objects, containers, and goal po-\nsitions. They can then plan a sequence of actions to trans-\nport the target objects to their desired location. Since both\nthe objects in the room and high-level actions are respon-\nsive to physics, the robot agent needs to learn to use vision\nto decide when to go to grasp objects that can be success-\nfully reached while avoiding collisions (e.g. objects and\/or\nthe container might fall if the agent collides with obstacles)\nunder the realistic physic constraints.\n3.2. Scenes\nWe have created a TDW-House dataset to support this\nchallenge. As shown in Figure 2 (c), each house environ-\nment contains between 6 and 8 interconnected rooms such\nas bedrooms, living rooms, and kitchens. These rooms are\nfully populated with furniture and other items (see “Ob-\njects” below). The agent’s view might be blocked by ob-\nstacles such as walls, so it needs to explore the house in\norder to predict a full occupancy map of the scenes.\nThe dataset is modular in its design, comprising several\nphysical ﬂoor plan geometries with wall and ﬂoor material\nvariations (e.g. parquet ﬂooring, ceramic tile, stucco, carpet\netc.) and various furniture and prop layouts (tables, chairs,\ncabinets etc.), for a total of 15 separate environments. Fur-\nniture arrangements were interactively laid out by a 3D\nartist using 3D assets from the TDW model library [15].\nWe will make this dataset publicly available.\n3.3. Objects\nTo build physical house environments for the agent to\nnavigate, we also populated the various ﬂoor plans with\naround 50 categories of objects.\nThese include typical\nhousehold items like lamps, toys, vases, pillows, printers,\nand laptops. Except for non-movable objects like walls, all\nobjects respond to physics, so the embodied agent can in-\nteract with them.\n3.4. Embodiment\nWe use the Magnebot as an embodied agent. The Mag-\nnebot is equipped with an RGB-D camera and also capable\nof returning image masks for object ID segmentation, se-\nmantic segmentation, normals and pixel ﬂow. For interac-\ntions with scene objects, the avatar has two articulated arms\nwith 9-DOF “magnet” end-effectors for picking up objects\n(see supplementary material for details). All motion and\narm articulation actions are fully physics-driven.\nThe observation space in this challenge contains a ﬁrst-\nperson view RGB image, a depth map, and a semantic seg-\nmentation mask. The agent could use these observations to\nestimate the occupancy map (see below). And it can also\nobtain an object list based on the semantic segmentation\nmask.\n3.5. Action space\nWe developed a high-level API with action commands\ndesigned to ﬁt our task deﬁnitions, enabling an agent to\nmove and manipulate objects.\nOur design choices were\nintended to abstract away the details of low-level control,\nwhich could otherwise form a barrier to exploring novel so-\nlutions for this kind of TAMP-style embodied AI challenge.\nThere are two types of actions we consider in this trans-\nport challenge: navigation and interactive actions.\nAPI\nfunctions for navigation include Move Forward By (x m),\nRotate By (θ degrees), Rotate To (an object or target posi-\ntion). In our experiments, we make the actions discrete by\nsetting x = 0.5meter, θ = ±15◦. Rotate to +15◦and Ro-\ntate to −15◦means to rotate left or right by 15 degrees, re-\nspectively. Interactive action functions include Go to Grasp,\nDrop and Put In Container. Taking as an example a simple\ntask that involves the agent selecting an object to pick up\nbased on the segmentation mask returned by sensors, going\nto grasping it, then moving to a container and dropping the\nobject into the container, the action sequence we applied is\nGo to Grasp (object), Go To Grasp (container), and Put In\nContainer. We use Inverse Kinematics to implement these\ninteractive actions. The details can be found in the supple-\nmentary materials.\nSince our high-level action API is fully physics-driven,\nthese features also pose new challenges that have not ap-\npeared in previous navigation environments, but indeed ex-\nist in the real physical world. For example, the agent might\nfail to grasp one target object when we apply a Go to Grasp\naction. The reason might be that its arm cannot reach the\ntarget object. In this case, the agent needs to move close to\nthe object and make an attempt again. We also observe that\nthe objects\/container held by the avatar can fall off if they\nhit a heavy obstacle during the navigation. The agent would\nthen have to ﬁnd and pick up these items again. 3433\n3.6. Action Status\nWhen performing tasks, the simulation will also provide\nfeedback on its status and the status of its current action, in\norder to decide what action to take next. Each API func-\ntion returns an ActionStatus value indicating the status of\nthe agent – whether it is performing an action, succeeded\nat an action, or failed to complete the action. There are 18\ntypes of action status, including: whether a target object is\ntoo close or too far to reach, or is behind the agent; whether\nthe agent succeeded or failed to pick up an object, or over-\nshot the target; whether the agent collided with something\nheavy or is obstructed by an obstacle, etc. We can use these\nmeta data to deﬁne a reward function for policy learning or\npriors for planning.\n3.7. Dataset Generation\nTarget Objects The objects that the agent needs to transport\nas part of the challenge task are known as “target objects”.\nThese objects are located at “target positions” within the\nenvironment, guaranteed to be reachable by the agent. The\nset of target objects to be transported are randomly placed\nacross different rooms. In addition, there is a 25% chance\nof spawning a container at a traversable position in each\nroom. When a scene is initialized, the simulation loads a\npre-calculated “occupancy map”, i.e. a data ﬁle represent-\ning grid spaces occupied by objects.\nGoal Positions The locations within the environment where\ntarget objects must be deposited to complete the task are\nknown as “goal positions”.\nThe surfaces that target ob-\njects are to be deposited on are known as “goal position\nsurfaces”. Goal position surfaces can be on any of the fol-\nlowing furniture objects: Sofa, Bench, Table, Coffee table,\nand Bed. For each task, we set one unique piece of furniture\nin the scene as the goal position (e.g. only one coffee table,\nor one sofa in the house) in the TDW-House dataset.\nRobot Agent Initialization After the scene conﬁguration\nis initialized, the robot agent is spawned at an open location\nthat is free of other objects.\nTask Deﬁnition We deﬁne the goal of each task with two\ncomponents: 1) a set of objects and their counts, 2) the Goal\nPosition. For instance, “vase:2, bowl:2, jug:1; bed” means\nthat the agent must transport 2 vases, 2 toys, and 1 jug to the\nbed. There are ﬁve types of objects used as potential target\nobjects to be transported. Each task requires transporting 6\nto 8 objects.\nUnseen Home\nSeen Home\nFigure 3: Example layouts of seen and unseen houses.\n4. Experiments\nIn this section, we discuss our experimental setup, base-\nlines, implementation details and evaluation results.\n4.1. Experimental Setup\nSetup. We use 15 physically distinct houses for the exper-\niments. Example house layouts can be found in Figure 3.\nSince this challenge aims to test the agent’s generalization\nabilities, we split them into 10 seen houses (training) and\n5 unseen houses (test). We generated 100 tasks for each\nseen house and 20 tasks for each unseen house by randomly\nplacing target objects and containers into different rooms as\ndescribed above (for a total of 1000 training and 100 test\ntasks). We report the models’ performance on the test set\ntasks.\nEvaluation Metrics. The objective of this challenge is to\ntransport the maximum number of objects as efﬁciently as\npossible. We use the transport rate as an evaluation metric.\nThe transport rate is the fraction of the objects successfully\ntransported to the desired position within a given interaction\nbudget (deﬁned as a maximum episode length in steps). For\ntesting we set this maximum episode length to 1000 steps.\n4.2. Baseline Models\nWe implemented several baseline agents using both\nlearning- and planning-based algorithms. We found em-\npirically that it was difﬁcult for an end-to-end RL learning\nmodel (Pure RL baseline) to take observation data as input\nand directly search for an optimal policy over the agent’s ac-\ntion space, presumably because our task is very challenging\n(e.g. long-horizon, partial observability, involving complex\nphysical interaction, sparse rewards, etc.). Therefore, we\nimplemented additional baselines using a hierarchical plan-\nning framework with different exploration strategies.\nAs shown in Figure 4, we deﬁne four types of sub-goals\nfor this task: exploration, pick up a container, pick up an\nobject, and place. We use a rule-based high-level planner to\ndecide when to transition between sub-goals. For the explo-\nration sub-goal, the agent will either directly use the policy\nto navigate around the environment (RL Exploration base-\nline) or plan a shortest path from the current location to the\nwaypoints (Active, Frontier and Semantic Exploration base-\nlines). The agent can accumulate RGB images, depth maps,\nand segmentation masks to construct a 2D occupancy map\nand a semantic map during its exploration. When setting\nthe sub-goal as pick up a container or pick up an object,\nthe agent will plan a sequence of actions to move towards\na container or a target object and pick it up. For the place\nsub-goal, the agent uses a planner to generate a determinis-\ntic local policy to go to the goal position and drop the target\nobjects. We summarize the baseline models as follows:\n• Pure RL: We train an end-to-end RL policy using PPO\nby maximizing the reward of ﬁnding objects (either\ntarget objects, containers, or the goal position), grasp-\ning objects, putting objects into a container, and drop-\nping them onto the goal location. This model takes the\ninputs of observation and estimated occupancy map\nand directly outputs actions that the agent should ex-\necute in the environment.\n• RL Exploration: We train a policy network that max-\nimizes occupancy map coverage. The network yields\nan action to execute.\n• Frontier Exploration: Similar to [49], the agent uses\ndepth images and semantic segmentation masks to\nconstruct an occupancy map and a semantic map of\nthe scene. The agent randomly samples a waypoint\nfrom an unexplored area as a sub-goal for exploration.\nIt marks the location of target objects, containers, and\nthe goal position on its semantic map.\n• Active Exploration: We adapted a baseline from [7].\nInstead of randomly choosing an unexplored position\nin the occupancy map as a goal location to explore (as\nin the Frontier baseline), the Active baseline learns a\ngoal-agnostic policy by maximizing map coverage (us-\ning neural SLAM). The output is a waypoint position.\nThe local exploration planner uses this waypoint as a\nsub-goal.\n• Semantic Exploration:\nWe adapted a baseline\nfrom [8]. The Semantic baseline uses neural SLAM\nto learn an object\/goal-oriented “semantic” exploration\npolicy.

Implementation Details\nFor all the baselines, the input observation data are 256 ×\n256 size RGB images, depth maps, and semantic segmenta-\ntion masks. The action spaces include 3 navigation actions\n(i.e. move forward, rotate left, and rotate right) and 3 inter-\nactive actions (i.e. go to grasp, put in container, and drop).\nBelow we provide the details of the occupancy map, seman-\ntic map, policy training, high-level and low-level planners.\nOccupancy Map. We represent the global top-down occu-\npancy map as Og ∈R2×N×N, where N×N denotes the map\nsize and each element in this occupancy map corresponds\nto a region of size 0.25m×0.25m in the physical world. We\ncan recover a local occupancy map Ol ∈R2×K×K from\negocentric depth map, which comprises a local area in front\nof the camera. The two channels in each cell represent the\nprobability scores of the cell being occupied and explored,\nrespectively. We considered a cell to be occupied if there\nis an obstacle and a cell to be explored if the agent already\nknows whether it is occupied or not. The occupancy map is\ninitialized with all zeros and the agent always starts at the\ncenter of the map at the beginning of each episode.\nSemantic Map. Similar to the occupancy map, we can also\nconstruct a global top-down semantic map S ∈R3×N×N\nusing both depth images and semantic segmentation masks.\nThe value in each channel indicates if a cell contains target\nobjects, containers or goal position. Similar to the occu-\npancy map, we also initialized the semantic map with all\nzeros and set the agent starting position as the map center.\nThe agent can gradually update the semantic map when they\nﬁnd objects during the navigation exploration.\nPolicy learning. For all policy learning, we use a four-\nlayer CNN network and train for 10 million frames using\nProximal Policy Optimization [32]. In the Pure RL, RL\nExploration, and Semantic Exploration baselines, we take\nthe depth image, estimated occupancy map, and semantic\nmap as input. In the Active Exploration baseline, we take\nthe depth image and estimated occupancy map as inputs.\nIn the Pure RL and RL Exploration baselines, the model\ndirectly outputs an action. For Active and Semantic Ex-\nploration baselines, the models predict waypoints as sub-\ngoals. We use the same reward function for the Pure RL\nand Active Exploration baselines by encouraging the agent\nto ﬁnd new objects, grasp target objects, put objects into a\ncontainer, and drop objects onto the goal position. In the\nRL Exploration and Active Exploration baselines, we use a\ngoal-agnostic reward function by encouraging the agent to\nimprove the map coverage.\nHigh-level planner. We deﬁne a rule-based high-level plan-\nner to decide the sub-goal. The agent takes exploration as\na sub-goal by default. At the beginning, the sub-goal can\nswitch from exploration to picking up a container once a\ncontainer has been found. After a container is found or 20%\nof the interaction budget has been used up, the agent can\nswitch the sub-goal from exploration to picking up an ob-\nject if they ﬁnd a target object. After 90% of the interaction\nsteps, the agents will switch their sub-goal to place. If there\nis no container found, the agent will switch their sub-goal\nfrom picking up an object to place if they hold two objects.\nLow-level planner. We use a A-Star based planner to ﬁnd\nFigure 6: Navigation trajectories of frontier exploration (blue) against those of RL exploration (red). The frontier exploration\nﬁnds more efﬁcient routes to transport more objects.\nTable 1: Comparison of transport rate over 5 unseen rooms.\nMethod\nTransport Rate\nPure RL\n0.12±0.01\nRL Exploration\n0.33±0.02\nFrontier Exploration\n0.50±0.03\nActive Exploration\n0.51±0.01\nSemantic Exploration\n0.52±0.01\nthe shortest path from the current location to the sub-goal\nlocation and execute the high-level interactive actions for\nachieving the sub-goal. Every interaction steps, we update\nthe map and re-plan the path to the sub-goal.\n4.4. Result Analysis\nIn this section, we ﬁrst present the overall benchmark\nresults, and then perform in-depth analysis of the model de-\nsign. We hope that our experimental ﬁndings will provide\nuseful benchmarks for physically realistic Embodied AI.\nOverall Results. We ﬁrst plot the histogram of transport\nrate for all ﬁve unseen houses in Figure 5. We calculate the\nresults by averaging over all 20 testing tasks in each house.\nWe also summarize the overall quantitative evaluation re-\nsults of all baseline models measured by average transport\nrates of 5 unseen rooms in Table 1. The best model achieves\nan average of 0.52 transport rates under 1000 episodes. We\nhave two key observations: 1) There are no agents that can\nsuccessfully transport all the target objects to the goal lo-\ncations. This means our proposed task is very challenging\nand could be used as a benchmark to track the progress of\nembodied AI in physically realistic scenes. 2) The Pure\nRL baseline performs poorly. We believe this reﬂects the\ncomplexity of physical interaction and the large exploration\nsearch space of our benchmark. Compared to the previ-\nous point-goal navigation and semantic navigation tasks,\nwhere the agent only needs to navigate to speciﬁc coordi-\nnates or objects in the scene, the ThreeDWorld Transport\nchallenge requires agents to move and change the objects’\nphysical state in the environment(i.e. task-and-motion plan-\nning), which the end-to-end models might fall short on.\nExploration policy.\nThe results also indicate that com-\nbining RL exploration policy into a hierarchical planning\nframework could signiﬁcantly improve results over a purely\nRL-based approach (better performance of all Exploration\nbaselines over Pure RL). However, predicting a way-point\n(Frontier, Active, and Semantic Exploration) produced bet-\nter results than predicting an action (RL Exploration). We\nspeculate that RL Exploration can ﬁnd different positions,\nbut that it is hard for this model to learn complex physi-\ncal interactions. In practice, we observed that this agent\nalways failed to grasp objects, and frequently collided with\nthe obstacles, resulting in a low transport rate. These re-\nsults support the idea that our benchmark can enable novel\nalgorithms to combine learning-based and planning-based\nmethods to solve complex tasks in physically realistic envi-\nronments.\nNeural-based Exploration. We also found that learning\nto generate a waypoint for exploration (in the Active and\nSemantic Exploration baselines) did not show clear ad-\nvantages over the model without learning (Frontier Explo-\nration). The reasons might be two-fold: 1) the layout of\nour test scenes are quite different from those of the train-\ning scenes. 2) The occupancy and semantic maps used for\nlearning method do not convey much physics information.\nWe believe future work that explicitly incorporates physics\ninformation might help improve the generalization abilities\nof learning-based methods.\nQualitative Results.\nWe further visualize the trajectory\nof different agents in Figure 6. We can observe that the\nplanning-based agent using waypoints as sub-goals can al-\nways ﬁnd the shortest path to grasp objects and transport\nthem to the goal locations. The RL agent is good at explo-\nration, but might frequently hit obstacles, thus fail to trans-\nport objects efﬁciently. We will also provide demo videos\nin the supplementary materials.\n5. Conclusions and Future Work\nWe introduce a visually-guided task-and-motion plan-\nning benchmark that we call the ThreeDWorld Transport\nChallenge. Our preliminary experimental results indicate\nthat the proposed challenge can assess AI agents’ abilities\nto rearrange multiple objects in a physically realistic envi-\nronment. We believe our benchmark will also remove the\nbarrier to entering the ﬁeld of Task and Motion Planning\n(TAMP), allowing more people to study such a challenging\nTAMP-style embodied AI task in the face of realistic physi-\ncal constraints. We plan to include deformable or soft body\nobjects in future versions of this challenge.\n```\n\n#### 5. 学生问题\n问题1：介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」\n问题2：这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？\n问题3：这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？\n\n\n请输出论文总结\n### 输出格式（输出语言用中文）\n```\n## 💡 解答问题1 (...复述学生问题1...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (...复述学生问题2...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (...复述学生问题3...)\n...\n```\n","llm_summary_res":"## 🌟 论文解读 | 3DWorld Transport Challenge：物理世界中的智能机器人挑战\n\n## 📌 背景痛点\/本文动机\n随着人工智能和机器人技术的不断发展，能够在物理世界中感知和行动的机器人成为了计算机视觉和机器人社区的重要目标。然而，直接使用真实机器人进行训练和评估成本高昂且存在安全风险。因此，近年来，人们开始将模拟器纳入训练和评估人工智能算法的过程中。尽管3D虚拟环境在视觉导航方面取得了显著进展，但它们大多关注视觉导航，而忽略了物理交互。由于最终目标是开发能够在物理环境中感知和行动的系统，因此物理交互已成为家庭助理机器人训练的必要组成部分。\n\n## 🚀 核心方法\n本文提出了一个新的具身AI挑战：一个具有两个9自由度关节臂的具身智能体被随机放置在一个物理真实的虚拟家庭环境中。智能体需要探索房屋，寻找散落在不同房间中的少量物体，并将它们运送到一个期望的最终位置。此外，房屋周围还放置了各种容器，智能体可以找到这些容器并将物体放入其中。不使用容器作为工具时，智能体只能一次运输两个物体。然而，使用容器，智能体可以收集多个物体并一起运输。\n\n为了支持这项挑战，本文创建了一个基于TDW的房屋数据集，其中包含充满物理响应物体的多房间环境。此外，还开发了一个完全基于物理的高级导航和交互API，可以用于训练AI智能体在虚拟物理世界中与虚拟世界进行物理交互。由于模拟动作和环境完全基于物理，与之前的非物理或部分物理虚拟环境相比，它们提出了额外的挑战。例如，交互动作只有在目标物理可达时（即靠近且未被阻挡）才会成功。如果目标不在智能体的中心视图中，或者直接路径被阻挡（例如，被桌子阻挡），智能体就无法成功抓取物体。此外，与房屋中的物体发生物理碰撞也可能显著阻碍运输进度。因此，智能体必须学习利用视觉信号来同步导航和操作，以应对这些物理约束。\n\n## 📈 实验结果\n本文评估了几个现有的智能体，实验结果表明，现有的具身智能体在完成这项任务方面都存在困难。本文相信，在运输挑战中表现良好的模型将能够使机器人更加智能，能够在真实的物理世界中发挥作用。\n\n## 💬 可借鉴之处\n本文提出的3DWorld Transport Challenge为具身智能体在物理真实环境中的任务和运动规划能力提供了一个新的评估标准。此外，本文还开发了一个完全基于物理的高级导航和交互API，可以用于训练AI智能体在虚拟物理世界中与虚拟世界进行物理交互。这些成果为开发能够在物理世界中感知和行动的智能机器人提供了新的思路和方法。","llm_summary_res_status":200,"order":7,"query_answer":"## 💡 解答问题1 (介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」)\n\n这篇论文提出的benchmark是“ThreeDWorld Transport Challenge”，它是一个视觉引导的任务和运动规划基准，用于评估具身智能体在物理真实环境中的能力。在这个挑战中，一个装备有两个9自由度关节臂的具身智能体被随机放置在一个模拟的物理家庭环境中。智能体需要探索房屋，寻找散落在不同房间中的少量物体，并将它们运送到一个期望的最终位置。此外，房屋周围还放置了各种容器，智能体可以找到这些容器并将物体放入其中。不使用容器作为工具时，智能体只能一次运输两个物体。然而，使用容器，智能体可以收集多个物体并一起运输。\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？)\n\n论文中并没有明确指出进行实验所需的设备条件，例如GPU数量和内存大小。然而，根据论文内容，我们可以推测进行实验可能需要高性能的计算设备，因为模拟器需要处理大量的物理交互和渲染任务。此外，训练和推理模型可能需要使用GPU来加速计算。\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？)\n\n论文中提到，这个benchmark使用了一个基于物理的高级导航和交互API，可以用于训练AI智能体在虚拟物理世界中与虚拟世界进行物理交互。由于模拟动作和环境完全基于物理，与之前的非物理或部分物理虚拟环境相比，它们提出了额外的挑战。例如，交互动作只有在目标物理可达时（即靠近且未被阻挡）才会成功。如果目标不在智能体的中心视图中，或者直接路径被阻挡（例如，被桌子阻挡），智能体就无法成功抓取物体。此外，与房屋中的物体发生物理碰撞也可能显著阻碍运输进度。因此，智能体必须学习利用视觉信号来同步导航和操作，以应对这些物理约束。\n\n这些挑战使得reward hacking变得困难，因为智能体需要真正理解和适应物理环境，而不仅仅是通过简单的策略来获得奖励。因此，这个benchmark支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩。","query_answer_status":200}

These developments prompt questions about the potential for achieving Artificial General\nIntelligence (AGI) [2] and the timeline for such advancements. Predictions on the timeline for AGI vary [3], [4], with\nsome experts suggesting its inevitability [5]. A critical challenge in the journey towards AGI is developing benchmarks\nto assess AI’s evolving intelligence.\nIn this study, we introduce a novel and extensible benchmark for LLMs using grid-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe,\nConnect Four, and Gomoku, utilizing three distinct types of prompts (list, illustration, image). This benchmark helps\nassess the capabilities of LLMs, including rule comprehension, strategic thinking, and the ability to process and\nunderstand complex text and image prompts. The benchmark provides open-source code for simulating these board\ngames among LLMs and generating data files that store details of the simulated games. This study also includes the\nanalysis of a total of 2,310 games played among leading LLMs, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Sonnet by\narXiv:2407.07796v2  [cs.AI]  11 Jul 2024\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nAnthropic, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash by Google, GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o by OpenAI, and Llama3-70B\nby Meta. The open-source game simulation code can be utilized to test other LLMs and prepare submission data for\nthe leaderboard. The benchmark and leaderboard are designed to be extensible, accommodating new games and data\nsubmissions. The authors encourage contributions and welcome new results from other LLMs.\n2\nBackground and Related Research\nThe deep learning revolution has profoundly transformed natural language processing (NLP) since the 2010s, with\nthe introduction of the Transformer architecture in 2017 [6] playing a pivotal role in this evolution. The Transformer\narchitecture enabled parallel word processing, significantly improving the efficiency and handling of long-range\ntext dependencies. This innovation led to the creation of models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations\nfrom Transformers) [7] and OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series [8]. BERT advanced context\nunder-standing by analyzing word relationships within sentences, while the GPT series excelled in generative language\ncapabilities [1].\nThe scale of LLMs expanded exponentially, resulting in models with billions of parameters and exceptional performance\nacross various NLP tasks. Recent models include GPT-4 by OpenAI [9], Gemini by Google [10], Claude by Anthropic\n[11], Grok by xAI [12], and open-source options like LLaMA by Meta [13] and Mistral by Mistral [14]. These models\nhave pushed the boundaries of what is possible with LLMs, showcasing significant advancements in the field. LLMs are\nemployed in diverse tasks such as text summarization, language translation, content generation, and question-answering\n[15].\n2.1\nLarge Language Model Benchmarks\nLLMs produce outputs such that their responses can vary even with identical input [16]. Traditional metrics like\naccuracy, precision, F1 score, and mean squared error (MSE) are not suitable for evaluating LLM performance. Instead,\nspecialized datasets and benchmarks are needed to assess LLM capabilities comprehensively [17].\nBenchmarks such as GLUE [18], SuperGLUE [19], HELM [20], MMLU [21], BIG-bench [22], ARC [23], TruthfulQA\n[24], HellaSwag [25], and LiveBench [26] provide diverse tasks that test various aspects of LLMs. GLUE, introduced\nin 2018, includes tasks like sentiment analysis and question-answering to evaluate natural language understanding.\nSuperGLUE, launched in 2019, extends GLUE with more demanding tasks such as multi-sentence reasoning and\ncomplex reading comprehension. The Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark tests LLMs\nacross a wide array of subjects, including mathematics, history, computer science, and law, requiring extensive\nworld knowledge and problem-solving abilities [21]. BIG-bench offers 204 varied tasks in areas such as linguistics,\nmathematics, reasoning, biology, and software development, allowing researchers to evaluate LLMs comprehensively\nwhile managing operational costs [22]. HELM emphasizes transparency and performance in specific tasks, using a\nmulti-metric approach that includes fairness, bias, and toxicity assessments. It continually adapts to add new scenarios,\nmetrics, and models [20]. The AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence\nassesses AI systems’ complex reasoning capabilities through multiple-choice questions. The ARC includes an Easy Set\nfor basic retrieval methods and a Challenge Set for advanced reasoning, pushing AI towards deeper knowledge-based\nunderstanding [23]. The TruthfulQA benchmark assesses the accuracy and truthfulness of LLM responses, specifically\ndesigned to measure how well models can generate accurate answers and avoid hallucinations [24]. The HellaSwag\nbenchmark tests common sense reasoning by presenting models with sentences and multiple possible endings, requiring\nthem to choose the most logical continuation [25]. LiveBench addresses the test set contamination issue in LLM\nevaluation by offering a benchmark immune to such contamination and biases from human or LLM judging [26]. It\nfeatures frequently updated questions from recent sources, automatic scoring against objective ground-truth values, and\ndiverse tasks spanning math, coding, reasoning, language, instruction following, and data analysis [26].\nThe recent survey papers have provided comprehensive frameworks and methodologies that are invaluable for developing\nrobust benchmarks. One such paper, \"A Survey on Evaluation of Large Language Models,\" presents a detailed review\nfocusing on three key dimensions: what to evaluate, where to evaluate, and how to evaluate [27]. It encompasses a broad\nspectrum of tasks, including general natural language processing, reasoning, medical applications, ethics, education, and\nmore. This survey emphasizes the critical role of evaluation methods and benchmarks in assessing LLM performance,\nsummarizing both successes and failures across different tasks, and highlighting future challenges in the field [27].\nSimilarly, \"Evaluating Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey\" categorizes LLM evaluation into knowledge\nand capability, alignment, and safety [28]. This survey underscores the importance of rigorous assessment and the\ndevelopment of comprehensive evaluation platforms to ensure the safe and beneficial development of LLMs. It aims\nto guide responsible LLM advancement, ensuring that their evolution maximizes societal benefits while minimizing\n2\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\npotential risks [28]. Both surveys stress the necessity of treating evaluation as an essential discipline to aid the\ndevelopment of more proficient and ethically sound LLMs [29].\n2.2\nUtilizing Games for Evaluating LLMs\nExisting benchmarks primarily focus on language understanding tasks such as sentiment analysis, question-answering,\nand comprehension. Although some tasks in BIG-bench involve game-like problem-solving skills, they do not assess\nLLMs’ performance in conventional games like chess or Go, which are valuable for evaluating strategic thinking and\ndecision-making abilities. Using games as a benchmarking tool provides a unique perspective on LLM capabilities,\nhighlighting their proficiency in understanding rules, formulating strategies, and making decisions. Strategic games\nlike chess and Go emphasize predicting opponents’ moves, while games involving linguistic interaction test language\nmastery and contextual understanding. The dynamic nature of games allows researchers to observe LLMs’ adaptability\nand learning in real-time.\nEngaging in gameplay offers a standardized framework for comparing various LLMs’ performances under the same\nconditions, evaluating their strategic and creative problem-solving abilities, and capacity for innovative solutions. The\ncontrolled environment of games is instrumental for safely testing LLMs, allowing researchers to observe behaviors\nand mitigate potential risks or ethical concerns. Games involving human–AI interaction reveal how LLMs collaborate\nwith or compete against humans, shedding light on human–AI relationship dynamics. Therefore, testing LLMs within\nthe gaming domain extends beyond evaluating their ability to play games; it offers a comprehensive examination of\nstrategic thinking, language processing, creativity, and adaptability, which is crucial for advancing AI research and\nensuring the responsible development and deployment of these technologies.\nText-based games present a distinctive and challenging domain for benchmarking LLMs. These interactive fiction games\nrequire models to understand natural language, interpret evolving game states, and generate appropriate commands\nwithin narrative-driven environments, demanding a profound grasp of language, context, and strategic application [9].\nStudies on models like FLAN-T5, Turing, and OPT in the text-based game \"Detective\" reveal that these LLMs fall\nshort of state-of-the-art or human performance levels, facing challenges in adapting to game dynamics, learning from\npast interactions, and goal-oriented processing [30].\nThe \"GameEval-Evaluating LLMs on Conversational Games\" paper introduces a framework for assessing LLMs\nthrough goal-driven conversational games, highlighting their abilities in complex discussions, decision-making, and\nproblem-solving [31]. The SmartPlay benchmark assesses LLMs across diverse games, emphasizing their evolution\nas intelligent agents [32]. The MindAgent infrastructure evaluates multi-agent collaboration, enhancing human–AI\ncoordination [33].\nStudies on LLM behavior in social interaction games like the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma and the Battle of the Sexes\nshow challenges in adapting to strategies requiring mutual understanding and flexibility [34]. Research by Lorè and\nHeydari on \"Strategic Behavior of Large Language Models\" underscores the role of context in strategic decision-making\n[35]. Tsai et al. highlight limitations in LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 in constructing world models and leveraging\nknowledge in text-based games, suggesting the potential for targeted benchmarks [36].\nThe study \"Can Large Language Models Serve as Rational Players in Game Theory?\" evaluates LLMs’ potential in\ngame theory, identifying gaps in mimicking human rationality [37]. Another study explores models like Claude 2,\nGPT-3.5, and GPT-4 in processing game strategy and spatial information through Tic-Tac-Toe, finding that prompt\ndesign significantly impacts performance [38].\nGTBENCH evaluates LLMs’ strategic reasoning in competitive game-theoretic tasks [39]. It features 10 tasks covering\ncomplete vs. incomplete information, dynamic vs. static, and probabilistic vs. deterministic scenarios. Results show\nLLMs struggle in complete, deterministic games but perform better in probabilistic ones. Commercial LLMs like\nGPT-4 outperform open-source models such as CodeLlama-34b-Instruct. Code-pretraining aids strategic reasoning, but\nadvanced methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought do not consistently help. Detailed error profiles\nare provided to understand LLM behaviors [39].\nGAMEBENCH evaluates strategic reasoning in LLMs across nine game environments, each highlighting key reasoning\nskills [40]. Using GPT-3 and GPT-4, along with Chain-of-Thought prompting and Reasoning Via Planning (RAP),\nthe study finds that while these frameworks improve performance, no model matches human capabilities, with GPT-4\nsometimes performing worse than random actions. The games are selected to avoid overlap with the models’ pretraining\ncorpuses.\nIn a previous study, the authors evaluated the strategic thinking capabilities of various LLMs, including Claude 2.1,\nGemini-Pro 1.0, GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, Llama2-70B, and Mistral Large, by having them play Tic-Tac-Toe through a\n3\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nmobile app [41]. This study builds upon that research with additional games, more in-depth analysis, and a user-friendly\nweb-based game simulation software to evaluate more recent LLMs.\nA recent survey paper explores the state of the art in applying LLMs to gaming, identifying the various roles LLMs\ncan play within games. It highlights underexplored areas and promising directions for future research, reconciling the\npotential and limitations of LLMs in the gaming domain. This survey aims to serve as a foundation for future research\nand innovation in this emerging field [42].\nAnother recent survey paper explores LLM-based game agents and their role in advancing toward AGI. It introduces\nthe conceptual architecture centered on perception, memory, thinking, role-playing, action, and learning. The paper\nreviews methodologies and adaptation agility of existing LLM-based game agents across six game genres: adventure,\ncommunication, competition, cooperation, simulation, and crafting & exploration. It also provides future research\ndirections in this field [43].\nThese studies collectively deepen our understanding of LLMs’ strengths and weaknesses in gaming and interactive\ncontexts, providing a foundation for future research to enhance their performance and cognitive skills. They highlight\nthe value of using games as benchmarks to expose the capabilities and limitations of current AI systems, paving the\nway for developing advanced models with sophisticated reasoning and strategic thinking.\n3\nMethodology\nWe have developed a benchmark to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in rule comprehension and decision-making\nthrough grid-based games. This benchmark includes open-source web-based software for simulating games, accessible\non GitHub [44]. The web application is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with server-side AWS Lambda\nfunctions written in Python to leverage LLMs hosted on AWS Bedrock. The game simulation web app enables LLMs\nto compete against each other, recording the details of each move for further analysis in JSON, CSV, TXT, and PNG\nformats, as well as summarizing game results.\nCurrently, the benchmark includes Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Gomoku, and is designed to be extensible to\naccommodate additional board games. A step-by-step guide for adding new game simulations is provided. As illustrated\nin Figure 1, the user interface of the game simulation web app allows users to select a game and the LLMs for the first\nand second players from a curated list. Users can also choose the type of predefined prompts (e.g., list, illustration,\nimage) and specify the number of consecutive games for the selected game, prompt, and player combination.\nFigure 1: Web-based app for game simulation shows the progress of a Connect Four game.\nThe game simulation initiates by sending the selected prompt to the web API of the chosen LLM for the first player,\nthen awaits its move. Upon receiving a response, the application updates the user interface to reflect the game’s progress,\nas demonstrated in Figure 1, subsequently queries the chosen LLM for the second player, and awaits its move. The\n4\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nprompts, which include the current state of the game, are continuously sent to each LLM’s web service until a player\nwins, the game ends in a draw, or a player is disqualified for making invalid moves. Each query and response are\nrecorded for every move. This methodology ensures seamless interaction between the application and the LLMs via\nweb API calls. The interactions are illustrated in Figure 2.\nFigure 2: The illustration of web-based app and web service interactions to play a game.\n3.1\nGames Available on the Benchmark and Possibility of Expansion to New Games\nWe have utilized three games in the benchmark; Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four and Gomoku. All of these games are\nclassical two-player games played on a grid; 3 by 3, 6 by 7, and 15 by 15, respectively [45] [46] [47]. These games can\nbe adapted to larger grids. The explanations of these games are given in Table 1 and the same explanations are used in\nthe prompts.\nTic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Gomoku are all solved games meaning their outcome (win, lose, or draw) can be\ncorrectly predicted from any position, assuming that both players play perfectly. In Tic-Tac-Toe, optimal play from\nboth participants guarantees a draw. The first player can always win with optimal play in Connect Four. In the Gomoku\ngame, the first player is guaranteed to win with optimal play [48].\nWe designed this benchmark to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new games such as checkers and chess. The\ncode is modular, facilitating the easy integration of additional games. Additionally, we prepared a step-by-step guide on\nhow to add a new game to the benchmark, which can be found on the game simulation page under the ‘How to Add\nYour Own Game’ link. We encourage interested individuals to contribute to the development of the benchmark\n3.2\nLLMs Tested & New Result Submission to the Leaderboard\nNumerous LLMs are available for evaluation. To ensure a meaningful and comprehensive assessment, we carefully\nselected LLMs based on several criteria. Firstly, we chose LLMs that are not specifically trained for the games used in\nthe benchmark. Although the training data of proprietary LLMs is not publicly disclosed, we assume they are not trained\nexplicitly for any of the benchmark games. We prioritized well-known, high-performing LLMs developed by industry\nleaders such as OpenAI and Google, given their significant contributions to AI advancements. Additionally, we included\nLLMs from emerging startup companies that have gained attention in the AI community, such as Anthropic. To further\nenrich our evaluation, we aimed to test open-source models and included Meta’s Llama3-70B model in our evaluation.\nThis selection covers a broad spectrum of innovative approaches, technological capabilities, and accessibility options.\nThe landscape of LLMs changes rapidly, with new models frequently emerging with improved capabilities. Therefore,\nwe provide game simulation software in the benchmark that generates submission files and encourage new submissions\nto the leaderboard. Contributors can evaluate other LLMs by integrating their LLM web service URL or API keys,\n5\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\ngenerating new results, and submitting them to the leaderboard. We believe the leaderboard will allow people to see the\nprogress of LLMs in different games as the leaderboard continues to be updated.\nCurrently, the benchmark includes results and detailed files for the following LLMs: Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3\nSonnet from Anthropic, Gemini 1.5 Flash and Gemini 1.5 Pro from Google, GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o from OpenAI,\nand Llama3-70B from Meta. To access these models, we utilized the web APIs provided by Google and OpenAI for the\nGemini and GPT-4 models. For accessing models from Meta and Anthropic, we employed Amazon Bedrock services,\nleveraging serverless AWS Lambda functions and API Gateways, as depicted in Figure 2.\nTo evaluate the decision-making capabilities of LLMs compared to random play, we included an option to select\n‘random play‘ as the opponent. This option generates random responses for each move. By testing all the LLMs against\nrandom play, we aim to determine the extent to which LLMs outperform random decision-making in game scenarios.\n3.3\nDetails of the Prompts\nWe utilized three types of prompts: list, illustration, and image. Each prompt is divided into eight main components:\n1) an explanation of the game, 2) an explanation of the format for the game status, 3) the current game status, 4) a\ndefinition of the LLM’s role followed by a request for its next move, 5) an explanation of the response format, 6) an\nexplanation of invalid moves, 7) a warning if the previous move was invalid, including an explanation of why it was\ndeemed invalid, and 8) the current number of invalid moves made by the player, as well as the number of invalid moves\nuntil the player is dis-qualified. The current game status, the invalid move warning, and the invalid move counts are\ndynamically generated and updated as the game progresses. Table 2 presents the components of a ’list’ type prompt for\nthe Tic-Tac-Toe game. This standardized format ensures consistency in prompts throughout the game while allowing\nfor dynamic updates of the game state.\nTable 1: Explanation of the games used in the prompts.\nTic-Tac-Toe\nTic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a 3 by 3 grid. The first player uses X symbols, and the\nsecond player uses O symbols. Players take turns placing their symbols in an empty cell on the\ngrid. The objective is to align three of your symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\nThe player who first aligns three of their symbols wins the game. Strategic placement is crucial;\nbesides aiming to align their symbols, players must also block their opponent's potential alignments\nto avoid defeat.\nConnect Four\nConnect Four is a two-player game played on a 6 by 7 grid. The first player uses red (R) discs,\nand the second player uses yellow (Y) discs. Players take turns dropping their discs into a column\nfrom the top row where there is still at least one empty space. The dropped disc falls straight down,\noccupying the lowest available row within the column. The objective is to align four of your discs\neither horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The player who first aligns four of their discs wins the\ngame. Strategic placement is crucial; besides aiming to align their discs, players must also block\ntheir opponent's potential alignments to avoid defeat.\nGomoku\nGomoku is a two-player game played on a 15 by 15 grid. The first player uses black (B) dots, and\nthe second player uses white (W) dots. Players take turns placing their dots on an empty intersection\nof the grid. The objective is to align five of your dots either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\nThe player who first aligns five of their dots wins the game. Strategic placement is crucial; besides\naiming to align their dots, players must also block their opponent's potential alignments to avoid\ndefeat.\nThe content of the three types of prompts is consistent, except for the representation of the current state of the game\n(previous moves). The ‘list’ prompt enumerates previous moves for each player in a “row, column” format. The\n‘illustration’ prompt depicts the current state of the grid using specific symbols for the first and second players (X and O\nfor Tic-Tac-Toe, R and Y for Connect Four, and B and W for Gomoku) and ’e’ for empty cells. The ‘image’ prompt\nvisualizes the current state by providing a snapshot of the game board. These differences are detailed in Table 3.\nLLMs use parameters like max tokens, temperature, top-p, and frequency penalty to fine-tune their outputs [49] [50].\nMax tokens control length, temperature adjusts creativity, top-p limits word choices to balance creativity and coherence,\nand frequency penalty reduces repetition. These settings customize LLM responses for applications such as customer\nsupport and content creation. We use default configurations for all parameters except the prompt, trusting the creators’\nfine-tuning for optimal performance.\nThe games continued until one player won, a draw occurred, or a disqualification was necessary. To gather statistical\ndata on the outcomes, each game between opponents was repeated five times. Disqualification occurred if a player\n6\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nTable 2: The parts of a prompt for the TicTacToe game.

When a player made an invalid\nmove, they were warned about the invalidity, provided with the reason (as shown in Table 2), and asked to make their\nmove again. Continuous invalid moves led to disqualification to ensure fairness and prevent indefinite delays. During\nthe game sessions conducted through the web application, data on gameplay was collected and stored in JSON, CSV,\nTXT, and PNG formats. Samples of these files are available on GitHub, along with zip files containing the complete\ndata from bulk runs performed for the results presented here. The JSON files include comprehensive details such as\ndate\/time, players, game result, duration, and all moves, covering both valid and invalid attempts. They also include the\ncurrent game status sent to the LLM and the responses received from the LLM for each move. Additionally, the JSON\nformat is used for the leaderboard submissions. A streamlined summary of the game is available in a CSV file. The\nTXT file provides an illustrated representation of the game moves, while the PNG files display snapshots of the board\nafter each move. All files generated during this study are publicly available on GitHub.\n3.4\nDetails of the Data Generated by the Game Simulation Web App\nThe data generated by the game simulation web app is downloaded as a zip file either after a ’run’ between two LLMs\nor after a ’bulk run’ between all LLMs listed as first and second players.

The sample files and zip files generated during the\n’bulk run’ of data collection for the results presented in this study are available on the GitHub page [44].\n3.5\nMetrics and Methods for Evaluation\nWe evaluated the performance of LLMs across three games (Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Gomoku) using different\nprompt types (list, illustration, and image) to assess their ability to handle various formats of game state representation.\nPerformance comparisons were made against a random play strategy to establish a baseline, highlighting the strategic\nadvantages of the LLMs. The primary metrics for evaluation included win rates, draw rates, and disqualification\nrates, providing an overview of the LLMs’ performance as both the first and second players. Additionally, we tracked\nthe number of invalid moves per game and the average number of moves per game to assess rule adherence and\ngame engagement. To delve deeper into the LLMs’ strategic thinking, we analyzed missed opportunities to win\nor block an opponent’s win, counting instances where the LLMs failed to make critical moves. We presented the\nmissed opportunities per game by averaging the missed opportunities across all games that resulted in a win, draw, or\ndisqualification. We also normalized the number of missed opportunities by the number of valid moves to calculate the\npercentage of missed opportunities per valid move. The results were visualized through charts and tables to provide\na clear depiction of performance metrics and trends, as shown in the Results section. Additionally, we present the\noutcomes of each match between seven LLMs and a random play generator across different games (a total of 2,310\nmatches) in a results matrix table. We also maintain a leaderboard on the GitHub page that allows for filtering and\n8\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nTable 4: The data included in the JSON files.\nJSON File\nContent\nThe main JSON\nfile\nthat\nin-\ncludes\ndetailed\noutcomes\nof\nthe game.\nFor\nexample,\nthe\nname of the file\ncould be “tic-tac-\ntoe_list_gemini-\n1.5-\npro_gemini-1.5-\nflash_winner1st_240707-\n164940.json”\n- UUID: Unique identifier for the game instance.\n- DateTime: Timestamp indicating when the game was played.\n- GameType: Type of game (tic-tac-toe, connect four, or gomoku).\n- PromptType: Type of prompt used (list, illustration, or image).\n- PromptVersion: Version of the prompt (date that the prompt was last modified).\n- GameNumber: Sequential identifier for the game.\n- Player1: LLM model name for the first player.\n- Player2: LLM model name for the second player.\n- Result: Outcome of the game (winner1st, winner2nd, draw, disqualified1st, disqualified2nd).\n- GameDuration: Duration of the game in seconds.\n- TotalMoves: Total number of moves made during the game.\n- Player1Moves: Number of moves by the first player.\n- Player2Moves: Number of moves by the second player.\n- Player1InvalidAlreadyTaken: Number of moves where the first player attempted to place a\nmove in an already occupied location.\n- Player2InvalidAlreadyTaken: Number of moves where the second player attempted to place a\nmove in an already occupied location.\n- Player1InvalidFormat: Number of moves in invalid format by the first player.\n- Player2InvalidFormat: Number of moves in invalid format by the second player.\n- Player1OutOfBounds: Number of moves made outside the board boundaries by the first player.\n- Player2OutOfBounds: Number of moves made outside the boundaries by the second player.\n- FinalGameState: The final status of the board presented in the chosen prompt type.\n- Moves: Array of move objects detailing each move made during the game.

The chart\nsummarizes the performance of the seven LLMs as well as random play in terms of win rates, draw rates, and dis-\nqualification rates as both the first and second players. Claude 3.5 Sonnet has the highest winning percentage as the first\nplayer (88.57%) but a lower winning percentage as the second player (17.14%). GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro show\nstrong performance as both the first and second players, while random play results in the highest disqualification rates\nFigure 3: Tic-Tac-Toe game outcomes using the ‘list’ prompt where each LLM faced six others and the ‘random play’\nas both player 1 and player 2, playing each opponent 5 times (280 games total).\nFigure 4 displays the performance metrics of seven LLMs and a random play strategy in terms of win rates, draw rates,\nand disqualification rates when playing Tic-Tac-Toe as the first and second player, based on the illustration prompt\nformat. The chart shows significant performance variations among the LLMs, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet exhibiting the\nhighest winning rates as the first player, indicating a strong strategic advantage. Llama3-70B and GPT-4 Turbo also\ndemonstrate strong performance. Disqualification rates are generally low but notable for some models, such as Gemini\n1.5 Flash, indicating occasional invalid moves. The random player serves as a baseline comparison, with lower winning\nrates and higher disqualification rates, highlighting the superior strategic capabilities of the LLMs.\nFigure 5 displays the performance metrics of various LLMs and a random play strategy in terms of win rates, draw\nrates, and disqualification rates when playing Tic-Tac-Toe as the first and second player, based on the image prompt\nformat. Key observations indicate that Claude 3.5 Sonnet has a high disqualification rate as both the first (46.67%) and\nsecond player (53.33%), indicating a struggle with rule compliance. Similarly, GPT-4 Turbo and Gemini 1.5 Pro also\nshow significant disqualification rates. GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o exhibit the highest winning rates. The random play\nbaseline has high disqualification rates, highlighting the strategic advantages of LLMs compared to random strategies.\nNo draws occurred in the Tic-Tac-Toe games using the image prompt. Llama3-70B does not accept images, so it was\nnot used when testing any of the games with the image prompt type.\nThe chart in Figure 6 displays the performance metrics of various LLMs and a random play strategy in terms of win\nrates, draw rates, and disqualification rates when playing Connect Four as the first and second player using the list\nprompt type.

Significant disqualification rates\nare evident among several LLMs, particularly when playing as the second player, indicating challenges in adhering\nto the game’s rules. Models like Gemini 1.5 Flash and Llama3-70B had high disqualification rates. Winning rates\nvary widely, with some models showing strong performance as the first player while struggling as the second player.\nThe notable disqualification rates suggest that strategic complexity and rule comprehension are significant factors\naffecting LLM performance. Overall, the chart highlights the variability in strategic abilities and reliability of different\nLLMs, emphasizing the need for further improvements in their rule adherence and strategic planning capabilities. The\nrandom play baseline, with no recorded wins, draws, or disqualifications, underscores the superior strategic thinking\nand performance of the LLMs despite their challenges.\nFigure 11 illustrates the performance metrics of various LLMs and a random play strategy in terms of win rates and\ndisqualification rates when playing Gomoku as the first and second player using the image prompt type.

There is a marked variation in win rates among the models, with some achieving higher\nsuccess as the first player. The random player baseline demonstrates no recorded wins, draws, or disqualifications.\nThe chart in Figure 12 illustrates the performance of LLMs and a random play strategy in terms of moves per game and\ninvalid moves per game when they participated as both first and second players in Tic-Tac-Toe across three prompt\ntypes: list, illustration, and image. The random play strategy serves as a baseline, indicating performance without\nstrategic thinking. Generally, the number of moves per game increases with the complexity of the prompt, with image\nprompts resulting in the highest number of moves across all models. For list prompts, LLM performance ranged from\n6.46 to 7.43 moves per game, while random play showed a higher number at 10.11. Illustration prompts saw a slight\nincrease in moves for most models, peaking with Gemini 1.5 Flash. Invalid moves were minimal for list prompts but\nincreased significantly for illustration prompts, particularly for Gemini 1.5 Flash, and were highest for image prompts,\nnotably for Claude 3 Sonnet and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Random play consistently exhibited higher invalid moves across all\nprompt types, underscoring its lack of strategic planning compared to the LLMs. Llama3-70B was not used for the\nimage prompt since it cannot accept images.\nThe chart in Figure 13 compares the performance of LLMs and a random play strategy in terms of moves per game\nand invalid moves per game, when they participated as both first and second players, for Connect Four across three\n13\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nFigure 10: Gomoku game outcomes using the ‘illustration’ prompt where each LLM faced six others and the ‘random\nplay’ as both player 1 and player 2, playing each opponent 5 times (280 games total).\nFigure 11: Gomoku game outcomes using the ‘image’ prompt where each LLM faced five others and the ‘random play’\nas both player 1 and player 2, playing each opponent 5 times (210 games total).\nprompt types: list, illustration, and image. Overall, the number of moves per game tends to increase with the complexity\nof the prompt, with the highest number of moves observed in the image prompt format. For list prompts, the LLMs\ndemonstrated consistent moves per game with minimal invalid moves. However, there was a significant increase in\ninvalid moves in the illustration prompts for GPT-4 Turbo and in the image prompts for Claude 3 Sonnet. Notably,\nrandom play showed relatively lower invalid moves, likely because invalid moves (already taken slots) can only occur\nwhen all rows of a column are filled in Connect Four. These results highlight the challenges faced by LLMs in handling\nmore complex and visually demanding prompt formats.\nFigure 14 illustrates the performance of LLMs and a random play strategy in terms of moves per game and invalid\nmoves per game for Gomoku, across list, illustration, and image prompt types. Generally, the number of moves per\ngame and the number of invalid moves per game increases for LLMs with the complexity of the prompt, with the highest\nmoves recorded in the image prompt format. Invalid moves are minimal in list prompts but increase significantly in\nillustration and image prompts, especially for models like Gemini 1.5 Flash, GPT-4 Turbo, and Llama3-70B. Random\nplay shows relatively fewer invalid moves, as it is less likely to place a move on an already occupied space before the\ngame has progressed significantly in the 15 by 15 grid of Gomoku. This chart highlights the challenges LLMs face in\nhandling more complex and visually demanding prompt formats.\n14\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nFigure 12: Moves per game and invalid moves (already taken) per game for Tic-Tac-Toe.\nFigure 13: Moves per game and invalid moves (already taken) per game for Connect Four.\nWe analyzed the strategic decision-making capabilities of LLMs by counting instances where they missed opportunities\nto win or block an opponent’s win with one move. For example, in Tic-Tac-Toe, if the first player had two of its symbols\nin a row along with an empty space and did not place its next move in that space to win the game, it was counted as a\nmissed opportunity to win. Similarly, if the second player did not place its next move in the empty space to block the\nfirst player from winning after the first player had two symbols in a row, it was recorded as a missed opportunity to\nblock. Our analysis covered 70 games per LLM for the list and illustration prompt types, and 60 games per LLM for\nthe image prompt type.\nFigure 15 presents the frequency of missed opportunities to win or avoid a loss per Tic-Tac-Toe game. LLMs generally\nperformed better by missing fewer opportunities in list prompts compared to illustration and image prompts. Claude 3.5\nSonnet showed the fewest missed opportunities to win in the list and illustration prompts, while GPT-4 Turbo showed\nthe fewest in the image prompt. The frequency of missed opportunities to block an opponent’s win was generally higher\nacross all prompt types, with Gemini 1.5 Flash facing notable challenges in the illustration prompts.\nIn general, missing fewer win and block opportunities per game indicates better performance for an LLM. However,\nif an LLM makes many invalid moves and gets disqualified without creating any opportunities to win, the number of\nmissed opportunities to win will be zero, falsely suggesting no missed opportunities. To avoid such confusion in the\ninterpretation of results and to further analyze performance, we normalized the missed opportunities by using the number\nof valid moves and calculated the percentage of opportunities missed per valid move. The chart in Figure 16 shows\nthe percentage of missed win and block opportunities per valid move for various LLMs in Tic-Tac-Toe across three\nprompt types: list, illustration, and image. The blue bars rep-resent the percentage of missed win opportunities, while\nthe orange bars represent the percentage of missed block opportunities. Generally, LLMs missed fewer opportunities in\n15\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nFigure 14: Moves per game and invalid moves (already taken) per game for Gomoku.\nFigure 15: Strategic move opportunities missed per Tic-Tac-Toe game.\nthe list prompts compared to illustration and image prompts. For instance, Claude 3.5 Sonnet had a 9% missed win\nopportunity rate and 20% missed block opportunity rate for list prompts, while it missed 21% and 28%, respectively,\nfor illustration prompts. Similarly, GPT-4 Turbo had a notable increase in missed block opportunities for illustration\nprompts. The trend is consistent across other models, indicating that LLMs face greater challenges in handling visually\ncomplex prompts, leading to higher rates of missed strategic opportunities. The chart highlights that while LLMs\ncan identify winning moves, they often struggle more with blocking opponents’ winning moves, especially as prompt\ncomplexity increases.\nFigure 17 shows the performance of various LLMs in terms of missed opportunities to either win or block the opponent\nfrom winning in Connect Four. In Connect Four, if a player had three of its discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or\ndiagonally) along with an empty slot and did not place its next move in that slot to complete four in a row and win the\ngame, it was counted as a missed opportunity to win. Similarly, if the opponent did not place its next move in the empty\nslot to block the first player from winning once the first player had achieved three discs in a row, it was recorded as a\nmissed opportunity to block. According to the chart, LLMs tend to miss more opportunities to block than to win. For\nexample, in the list prompt format, Claude 3 Sonnet has a high rate of missed opportunities to block at 1.28 per game,\nwhile it misses 0.88 opportunities to win. Similarly, Gemini 1.5 Flash misses 0.95 opportunities to block and 0.22 to\nwin. This trend is consistent across other models and prompt types, indicating a common difficulty among LLMs in\nanticipating the opponent’s winning moves. In the image prompt format, Claude 3.5 Sonnet misses 0.68 opportunities\n16\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nFigure 16: Percentage of strategic move opportunities missed per Tic-Tac-Toe valid move.\nto block and 0.97 to win, indicating challenges in both defensive and offensive strategies. In the illustration prompt,\nGPT-4o and Claude 3 Sonnet miss the most opportunities compared to other LLMs.\nFigure 17: Strategic move opportunities missed per Connect Four game.\nGPT-4 Turbo appears to miss fewer opportunities than other LLMs in the illustration prompt format. However, a careful\nanalysis of the previous chart in Figure 7 reveals that GPT-4 Turbo had a disqualification rate of 82.66% as the first\nplayer and 68.57% as the second player out of a total of 70 games using the illustration prompt in Connect Four. These\nrates are significantly higher than those of other LLMs. Further review of Figure 13 shows that GPT-4 Turbo averaged\n13.49 invalid moves per game out of 23.43 moves, which is again significantly more than other LLMs. While GPT-4\nTurbo seems to have missed fewer opportunities, this may result from not having many valid moves. To gain better\ninsight into the LLMs’ strategic capabilities in utilizing opportunities, we focused on valid moves and analyzed the\npercentage of missed win and block opportunities per valid move. Figure 18 shows the results of this analysis. For list\nprompts, Claude 3 Sonnet missed the most block opportunities. In illustration prompts, Llama3-70B and GPT-4 Turbo\nperformed better. In image prompts, missed block opportunities were notably higher for Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini\n1.5 Pro.\n17\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nFigure 18: Percentage of strategic move opportunities missed per Connect Four valid move.\nAccording to the chart in Figure 19, LLMs generally miss more opportunities to win than to block in the Gomoku\ngame. In Gomoku, if a player has four stones in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) and an empty space\nbut does not place its next move in that space to complete five in a row, it is counted as a missed opportunity to win.\nSimilarly, if the opponent does not place its next move in the empty space to block the first player from winning once\nthe first player has four stones in a row, it is recorded as a missed opportunity to block. In the list prompt format, both\nClaude 3 Sonnet and Gemini 1.5 Flash miss approximately 1.87 opportunities to win per game, while their missed\nopportunities to block are slightly lower. In the illustration prompt format, Gemini 1.5 Flash misses 1.7 opportunities to\nwin and 0.82 to block. This trend indicates that while LLMs can often identify opportunities to block, they struggle\nmore with recognizing and capitalizing on winning opportunities. In the image prompt format, GPT-4o exhibits the\nhighest number of missed opportunities, with 1.34 missed chances to win and 1.32 to block per game. This highlights\nsignificant challenges for LLMs in processing and acting upon image-based inputs. Overall, the chart emphasizes that\nwhile LLMs are reasonably adept at blocking the opponent’s winning moves, they face greater difficulty in identifying\nand seizing their own winning opportunities, especially in more complex and visually demanding formats.\nFigure 19: Strategic move opportunities missed per Gomoku game.\n18\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nIn Figure 20, we further analyzed the missed opportunities by normalizing them per valid move, as we did in Figure\n16 for Tic-Tac-Toe and Figure 18 for Connect Four. Figure 20 displays the percentage of missed win and block\nopportunities per valid move for various LLMs in Gomoku across three prompt types: list, illustration, and image.\nGenerally, the LLMs show a higher percentage of missed block opportunities compared to win opportunities across\nall prompt types. In list prompts, Gemini 1.5 Flash missed the most block opportunities. Gemini 1.5 Pro performed\nthe best with no missed opportunities for illustration prompts. In image prompts, GPT-4 Turbo performed the best in\nminimizing missed opportunities.\nFigure 20: Percentage of strategic move opportunities missed per Gomoku valid move.\nUtilizing the Game Simulation web app to generate data for new LLMs or the open-access data available on GitHub for\nthe LLMs assessed here, further analysis can be conducted. For instance, analyzing the creation of winning opportunities\ncan provide additional insights. This can be achieved by counting instances where the LLM creates potential winning\nopportunities (i.e., aligning two moves for Tic-Tac-Toe, three moves for Connect Four, and four moves for Gomoku).\nSuch analysis can reveal that a high number of created opportunities may indicate proactive strategic thinking by the\nLLMs. Contributions to the repository with suggestions and new evaluation metrics are encouraged to enhance the\nassessment of LLM capabilities in grid-based games.\nFigures 21, 22 and 23 summarize the outcomes of 2,310 games played between seven LLMs and a random play\ngenerator across different prompt types (list, illustration, image) for the games Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Gomoku,\nrespectively. As shown in these results matrices, the LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of success across different\ngames and prompt types. Models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and Gemini 1.5 Pro showed strong performance in\nsimpler formats but struggled with more complex prompts. Random play consistently had the highest number of invalid\nmoves, highlighting its lack of strategy. The data suggests that while some LLMs handle simpler game prompts well,\nmore complex formats reveal significant challenges in their decision-making processes. In the result matrices, the W\ncolumn shows the total number of games the LLM won as the first and second player, D indicates draws, and Q shows\nthe total number of games the LLM was disqualified as the first and second player. Each LLM played 5 games with\neach corresponding opponent for each game and prompt type combination, totaling 35 games per player for list and\nillustration prompts, and 30 games per player for the image prompt type. The lower game count for the image prompt\ntype is because Llama3-70B cannot accept images and therefore was not used with the image prompt type. The result\nmatrix is also hosted on the project’s GitHub page.\nFigure 24 displays a portion of the leaderboard page of the LLM Game Benchmark, summarizing the results of games\nplayed between various LLMs and a random play generator. Key metrics on the leaderboard include win ratios, number\nof wins, dis-qualifications, invalid moves, and total moves for both the first and second players. Users can filter games\nby type, prompt type, and LLM players, and sort results by clicking on any of the column headers. Functionality to\naggregate results by game type, prompt type, and LLM player is provided on the leaderboard page. The initial data\nincludes results from Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o and\nRandom-Play. Each LLM played against each other LLM five times for each game and prompt type combination. New\ngame result submissions are welcome and can be generated using the game simulation web software.

The data used to fill in the leaderboard page can be\ndownloaded in JSON format.\n5\nDiscussion\nThis study provides a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5\nFlash, Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, and Llama3-70B, alongside a random play generator across three games\n(Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Gomoku) and three prompt types (list, illustration, image). Each LLM played five\ngames per game and prompt type against each opponent, resulting in a total of 2,310 games for analysis.\nThe performance of the LLMs varied significantly across different games and prompt types. Simpler games like\nTic-Tac-Toe experienced fewer invalid moves and disqualifications compared to more complex games like Connect\nFour and Gomoku, highlighting the models’ varying capacities to handle increasing game complexity. LLMs performed\nbetter with list prompts for Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect Four, while more complex prompt formats, particularly illustration\nand image prompts, revealed challenges in strategic decision-making. These formats led to higher disqualification rates\nand missed strategic opportunities, indicating difficulties in interpreting visual data and maintaining consistency.\nThe random play strategy consistently recorded the highest number of losses and invalid moves, serving as a useful\nbaseline for gauging LLM performance. The stark contrast between random play and the LLMs underscores the models’\ncapacity for strategic decision-making, though there remains room for improvement in handling complex and visual\ndata.\nIn Tic-Tac-Toe, LLMs demonstrated strong performance with list prompts, exhibiting minimal invalid moves, indicating\na good understanding of the game’s basic rules. Performance declined with illustration prompts, as some LLMs\n1LLM Grid-Based Game Leaderboard: https:\/\/research-outcome.github.io\/LLM-Game-Benchmark\/leaderboard\/\n20\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nFigure 22: The results matrix showing the outcomes of matches between seven LLMs and a random play generator\nsoftware across different games for Connect Four.\nshowed increased invalid moves, suggesting challenges in interpreting visual prompts. The most significant decline was\nobserved with image prompts, where many LLMs displayed a high number of in-valid moves, highlighting difficulties\nin processing and responding to image-based prompts.\nIn Connect Four, LLMs generally performed well with list prompts, although some showed increased invalid moves\ncompared to Tic-Tac-Toe, reflecting the higher complexity of Connect Four. A significant increase in invalid moves and\ndisqualifications was observed with both illustration and image prompts, indicating substantial challenges in visual\ninterpretation and decision-making in a more complex game context.\nFor Gomoku, performance was mixed across all prompt types, with a notable increase in invalid moves and disqualifica-\ntions. This game, being more complex and less common, likely posed significant interpretative and decision-making\nchallenges for the LLMs.\nDifferent prompt types had a notable impact on the performance of the LLMs. List prompts were generally well-handled\nby all LLMs, suggesting that textual representation of game states is within their current capabilities. Illustration\nprompts posed moderate challenges, as reflected in the increased number of invalid moves, indicating that graphical\nrepresentations are harder for LLMs to interpret. Image prompts were the most challenging, with the highest number of\ninvalid moves, highlighting a significant area for improvement in LLMs’ ability to process and act on image-based\ninputs.\nInvalid moves analysis revealed no out-of-bounds errors in any games, unlike in our previous study. This improvement\nis likely due to updated prompts that clearly define the range of possible column and row values. Invalid format errors\nwere made only by GPT-4 Turbo and Gemini 1.5 Flash, mostly due to hallucinated tag names in the JSON format.\nGPT-4 Turbo made several invalid format errors in Tic-Tac-Toe and Gomoku games for list and illustration prompt types,\nwhile Gemini 1.5 Flash made several errors during Gomoku games for illustration and image prompts. A significant\npercentage of the invalid moves were due to moving to an already occupied space, as shown in Figures 12, 13, and 14.\n21\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nFigure 23: The results matrix showing the outcomes of matches between seven LLMs and a random play generator\nsoftware across different games for Gomoku.\nFigure 24: A snapshot from the leaderboard showing aggregated results.\nThe analysis of missed strategic opportunities highlights the variability in LLMs’ decision-making processes. Models\nlike Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4 Turbo showed fewer missed opportunities in list prompts, suggesting a better grasp\nof straightforward game mechanics. However, the higher frequency of missed opportunities in illustration and image\nprompts indicates that LLMs struggle with interpreting and acting upon visual data.\nWhile the study uses games as a benchmark, the findings have broader implications for LLM applications in fields such\nas robotics, autonomous systems, and interactive AI. Improving LLMs’ strategic thinking and decision-making abilities\ncan enhance their performance in various real-world tasks requiring similar cognitive skills.\nThe extensible nature of the benchmark, with its modular code and open invitation for community contributions,\nrepresents a significant step towards collaborative LLM research. Encouraging researchers to add new games and share\n22\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\ntheir results can lead to a more dynamic and comprehensive evaluation framework. Future work can include a broader\nrange of games and tasks to evaluate LLMs across different strategic environments.\n6\nLimitations and Future Directions\nThe study’s methodology primarily focuses on grid-based games, which, while useful, may not fully capture the breadth\nof real-world strategic interactions. Future benchmarks should incorporate a wider variety of game types, including\nthose with more complex rules and longer-term strategic planning, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of\nLLM capabilities. Designing new, custom, purpose-built games to test specific aspects of LLM capabilities, such as\nadapting to unusual rules, would enhance benchmarking effectiveness and prevent the possibility of LLMs becoming\nfamiliar with the game, even if they were not specifically trained for it.\nThe simplicity of the games used in this benchmark facilitates basic evaluation but may not challenge LLMs’ strategic\ncapabilities as much as more complex games like chess or Go might. The fact that current LLMs have not mastered\neven these simple games provides valuable insights into their capabilities and limitations. Expanding the evaluation to\nlarger grids, such as 4 × 4 or 5 × 5 for Tic-Tac-Toe or 19 × 19 for Gomoku, could present additional challenges and\nprovide a clearer indicator of LLM performance.\nRelying on predefined prompts to guide LLMs’ moves may not adequately capture their potential for independent\nstrategic thinking or their ability to respond to changing game states. Although we updated prompts dynamically to\nwarn LLMs of invalid moves, further techniques, such as providing all previous invalid moves, could be explored to\nreduce invalid move numbers and disqualifications.\nThis study tested LLMs using structured prompts. Future research should investigate how these prompts influence LLM\nperformance and how variations in prompt structure might affect their understanding of game states and subsequent\nmoves. Such insights could help optimize LLMs for more complex and varied applications.\nThe evaluation metrics used in this study revealed a wide range of LLM capabilities. While these metrics provide a\ngood indication of performance, they may not fully capture the strategic complexity of the models. Further analysis\nof the moves—drawn from the JSON and PNG files—could offer a more detailed assessment of game progress over\ntime. The new analysis can be conducted using the Game Simulation web app to generate data for new LLMs or the\nopen-access data on GitHub. For example, evaluating the creation of winning opportunities, such as aligning moves\nfor Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Gomoku, can provide insights into proactive strategic thinking by the LLMs. The\nauthors encourage and welcome contributions to the repository in the form of suggestions and implementations of new\nmetrics and methods to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs.\nFocusing on a select group of LLMs might not capture the full diversity of strategic approaches across available models,\nhighlighting the importance of including a broader array in future research. The rapidly expanding landscape of LLMs,\nwith new models and improved versions emerging frequently, necessitates continuous updates to benchmarks. We\nwelcome submissions of other and new LLMs using the open-source game simulation software.\nFuture work could explore several promising directions to extend research and deepen our understanding of LLM\ncapabilities in strategic games and beyond. Multi-agent collaboration scenarios, where multiple LLMs work together\nagainst a common opponent or compete in teams, could assess their abilities in coordination, cooperation, and\ncompetitive strategy. Comparing newer versions of LLMs against those tested in this study could track progress and\nimprovements in AI strategic gaming capabilities over time.\nThis study suggests several avenues for future research and development. Firstly, improving LLMs’ abilities to interpret\nand act on visual data is crucial, as evidenced by high invalid move rates in illustration and image prompts. Enhancing\nvisual processing capabilities could significantly boost overall performance and utility. Secondly, further research is\nneeded to enhance LLMs’ decision-making processes in more complex environments.\n7\nConclusion\nThis study introduces a novel and extensible benchmark for LLMs through grid-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe,\nConnect Four, and Gomoku. The open-source game simulation code, available on GitHub, enables LLMs to compete\nand generates data files in JSON, CSV, TXT, and PNG formats for leaderboard rankings and further analysis. We\npresent the results of games among leading LLMs, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Sonnet by Anthropic,\nGemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash by Google, GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o by OpenAI, and Llama3-70B by Meta,\nand encourage submissions from other LLMs. By analyzing the performance of these models over 2,310 games,\nwe observed significant variations in their capabilities, particularly highlighting their struggles with complex and\n23\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nvisually-based prompt formats. Comparisons with a random play generator underscore the LLMs’ superior yet still\ndeveloping capacity for strategic decision-making.\nThe study reveals that while LLMs perform relatively well in simpler formats, such as list prompts for Tic-Tac-Toe\nand Connect Four, their performance declines with more complex prompts, especially those involving illustrations and\nimages. This trend indicates the current limitations in LLMs’ ability to interpret and act on visual data and manage\nincreased game complexity. Additionally, the models showed a tendency to make invalid moves when faced with more\ncomplex prompts, underscoring the need for improved strategic decision-making processes.\nSeveral areas for further investigation could be explored, such as expanding the types and complexity of games used for\nevaluation, testing more sophisticated prompt engineering techniques, and delving deeper into the effects of different\nprompt structures.\nThe findings of this study have broader implications beyond gaming, suggesting that advancements in LLMs’ strategic\nthinking and decision-making abilities could enhance their application in fields such as robotics, autonomous systems,\nand interactive AI. Furthermore, the modular and open-source nature of the benchmarking framework encourages\ncommunity contributions, which can lead to a more dynamic and comprehensive evaluation of LLM capabilities.\nIn conclusion, while the current evaluation highlights both the strengths and limitations of LLMs, it also points to\nthe need for ongoing research to enhance their ability to process complex and visual data, improve decision-making\nprocesses, and develop more sophisticated benchmarking tools. This continuous development will ultimately broaden\nthe applicability and effectiveness of LLMs in various real-world tasks.\nAcknowledgments\nThis study was partially supported by Florida Polytechnic University with grant number GR-24SUMR-OT.","pdf_path":"tools\/arxiv_tools\/asset\/pdf\/\/Evaluating Large Language Models with Grid-Based Game Competitions: An Extensible LLM Benchmark and Leaderboard.pdf","query_prompt":"### 任务\n你是一个人工智能领域的专家，你能够快速阅读arxiv上的各种AI前沿论文和相关博客，进而完美地回答学生的问题。\n现在请你阅读以下论文及博客，并回答学生的问题。\n\n### 论文信息\n###  1. 论文标题\n```\nEvaluating Large Language Models with Grid-Based Game Competitions: An Extensible LLM Benchmark and Leaderboard\n```\n#### 2. 论文摘要\n```\nWe introduce a novel and extensible benchmark for large language models\n(LLMs) through grid-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Gomoku.\nThe open-source game simulation code, available on GitHub, allows LLMs to\ncompete and generates detailed data files in JSON, CSV, TXT, and PNG formats\nfor leaderboard rankings and further analysis.

These developments prompt questions about the potential for achieving Artificial General\nIntelligence (AGI) [2] and the timeline for such advancements. Predictions on the timeline for AGI vary [3], [4], with\nsome experts suggesting its inevitability [5]. A critical challenge in the journey towards AGI is developing benchmarks\nto assess AI’s evolving intelligence.\nIn this study, we introduce a novel and extensible benchmark for LLMs using grid-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe,\nConnect Four, and Gomoku, utilizing three distinct types of prompts (list, illustration, image). This benchmark helps\nassess the capabilities of LLMs, including rule comprehension, strategic thinking, and the ability to process and\nunderstand complex text and image prompts. The benchmark provides open-source code for simulating these board\ngames among LLMs and generating data files that store details of the simulated games. This study also includes the\nanalysis of a total of 2,310 games played among leading LLMs, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Sonnet by\narXiv:2407.07796v2  [cs.AI]  11 Jul 2024\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nAnthropic, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash by Google, GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o by OpenAI, and Llama3-70B\nby Meta. The open-source game simulation code can be utilized to test other LLMs and prepare submission data for\nthe leaderboard. The benchmark and leaderboard are designed to be extensible, accommodating new games and data\nsubmissions. The authors encourage contributions and welcome new results from other LLMs.\n2\nBackground and Related Research\nThe deep learning revolution has profoundly transformed natural language processing (NLP) since the 2010s, with\nthe introduction of the Transformer architecture in 2017 [6] playing a pivotal role in this evolution. The Transformer\narchitecture enabled parallel word processing, significantly improving the efficiency and handling of long-range\ntext dependencies. This innovation led to the creation of models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations\nfrom Transformers) [7] and OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series [8]. BERT advanced context\nunder-standing by analyzing word relationships within sentences, while the GPT series excelled in generative language\ncapabilities [1].\nThe scale of LLMs expanded exponentially, resulting in models with billions of parameters and exceptional performance\nacross various NLP tasks. Recent models include GPT-4 by OpenAI [9], Gemini by Google [10], Claude by Anthropic\n[11], Grok by xAI [12], and open-source options like LLaMA by Meta [13] and Mistral by Mistral [14]. These models\nhave pushed the boundaries of what is possible with LLMs, showcasing significant advancements in the field. LLMs are\nemployed in diverse tasks such as text summarization, language translation, content generation, and question-answering\n[15].\n2.1\nLarge Language Model Benchmarks\nLLMs produce outputs such that their responses can vary even with identical input [16]. Traditional metrics like\naccuracy, precision, F1 score, and mean squared error (MSE) are not suitable for evaluating LLM performance. Instead,\nspecialized datasets and benchmarks are needed to assess LLM capabilities comprehensively [17].\nBenchmarks such as GLUE [18], SuperGLUE [19], HELM [20], MMLU [21], BIG-bench [22], ARC [23], TruthfulQA\n[24], HellaSwag [25], and LiveBench [26] provide diverse tasks that test various aspects of LLMs. GLUE, introduced\nin 2018, includes tasks like sentiment analysis and question-answering to evaluate natural language understanding.\nSuperGLUE, launched in 2019, extends GLUE with more demanding tasks such as multi-sentence reasoning and\ncomplex reading comprehension. The Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark tests LLMs\nacross a wide array of subjects, including mathematics, history, computer science, and law, requiring extensive\nworld knowledge and problem-solving abilities [21]. BIG-bench offers 204 varied tasks in areas such as linguistics,\nmathematics, reasoning, biology, and software development, allowing researchers to evaluate LLMs comprehensively\nwhile managing operational costs [22]. HELM emphasizes transparency and performance in specific tasks, using a\nmulti-metric approach that includes fairness, bias, and toxicity assessments. It continually adapts to add new scenarios,\nmetrics, and models [20]. The AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence\nassesses AI systems’ complex reasoning capabilities through multiple-choice questions. The ARC includes an Easy Set\nfor basic retrieval methods and a Challenge Set for advanced reasoning, pushing AI towards deeper knowledge-based\nunderstanding [23]. The TruthfulQA benchmark assesses the accuracy and truthfulness of LLM responses, specifically\ndesigned to measure how well models can generate accurate answers and avoid hallucinations [24]. The HellaSwag\nbenchmark tests common sense reasoning by presenting models with sentences and multiple possible endings, requiring\nthem to choose the most logical continuation [25]. LiveBench addresses the test set contamination issue in LLM\nevaluation by offering a benchmark immune to such contamination and biases from human or LLM judging [26]. It\nfeatures frequently updated questions from recent sources, automatic scoring against objective ground-truth values, and\ndiverse tasks spanning math, coding, reasoning, language, instruction following, and data analysis [26].\nThe recent survey papers have provided comprehensive frameworks and methodologies that are invaluable for developing\nrobust benchmarks. One such paper, \"A Survey on Evaluation of Large Language Models,\" presents a detailed review\nfocusing on three key dimensions: what to evaluate, where to evaluate, and how to evaluate [27]. It encompasses a broad\nspectrum of tasks, including general natural language processing, reasoning, medical applications, ethics, education, and\nmore. This survey emphasizes the critical role of evaluation methods and benchmarks in assessing LLM performance,\nsummarizing both successes and failures across different tasks, and highlighting future challenges in the field [27].\nSimilarly, \"Evaluating Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey\" categorizes LLM evaluation into knowledge\nand capability, alignment, and safety [28]. This survey underscores the importance of rigorous assessment and the\ndevelopment of comprehensive evaluation platforms to ensure the safe and beneficial development of LLMs. It aims\nto guide responsible LLM advancement, ensuring that their evolution maximizes societal benefits while minimizing\n2\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\npotential risks [28]. Both surveys stress the necessity of treating evaluation as an essential discipline to aid the\ndevelopment of more proficient and ethically sound LLMs [29].\n2.2\nUtilizing Games for Evaluating LLMs\nExisting benchmarks primarily focus on language understanding tasks such as sentiment analysis, question-answering,\nand comprehension. Although some tasks in BIG-bench involve game-like problem-solving skills, they do not assess\nLLMs’ performance in conventional games like chess or Go, which are valuable for evaluating strategic thinking and\ndecision-making abilities. Using games as a benchmarking tool provides a unique perspective on LLM capabilities,\nhighlighting their proficiency in understanding rules, formulating strategies, and making decisions. Strategic games\nlike chess and Go emphasize predicting opponents’ moves, while games involving linguistic interaction test language\nmastery and contextual understanding. The dynamic nature of games allows researchers to observe LLMs’ adaptability\nand learning in real-time.\nEngaging in gameplay offers a standardized framework for comparing various LLMs’ performances under the same\nconditions, evaluating their strategic and creative problem-solving abilities, and capacity for innovative solutions. The\ncontrolled environment of games is instrumental for safely testing LLMs, allowing researchers to observe behaviors\nand mitigate potential risks or ethical concerns. Games involving human–AI interaction reveal how LLMs collaborate\nwith or compete against humans, shedding light on human–AI relationship dynamics. Therefore, testing LLMs within\nthe gaming domain extends beyond evaluating their ability to play games; it offers a comprehensive examination of\nstrategic thinking, language processing, creativity, and adaptability, which is crucial for advancing AI research and\nensuring the responsible development and deployment of these technologies.\nText-based games present a distinctive and challenging domain for benchmarking LLMs. These interactive fiction games\nrequire models to understand natural language, interpret evolving game states, and generate appropriate commands\nwithin narrative-driven environments, demanding a profound grasp of language, context, and strategic application [9].\nStudies on models like FLAN-T5, Turing, and OPT in the text-based game \"Detective\" reveal that these LLMs fall\nshort of state-of-the-art or human performance levels, facing challenges in adapting to game dynamics, learning from\npast interactions, and goal-oriented processing [30].\nThe \"GameEval-Evaluating LLMs on Conversational Games\" paper introduces a framework for assessing LLMs\nthrough goal-driven conversational games, highlighting their abilities in complex discussions, decision-making, and\nproblem-solving [31]. The SmartPlay benchmark assesses LLMs across diverse games, emphasizing their evolution\nas intelligent agents [32]. The MindAgent infrastructure evaluates multi-agent collaboration, enhancing human–AI\ncoordination [33].\nStudies on LLM behavior in social interaction games like the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma and the Battle of the Sexes\nshow challenges in adapting to strategies requiring mutual understanding and flexibility [34]. Research by Lorè and\nHeydari on \"Strategic Behavior of Large Language Models\" underscores the role of context in strategic decision-making\n[35]. Tsai et al. highlight limitations in LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 in constructing world models and leveraging\nknowledge in text-based games, suggesting the potential for targeted benchmarks [36].\nThe study \"Can Large Language Models Serve as Rational Players in Game Theory?\" evaluates LLMs’ potential in\ngame theory, identifying gaps in mimicking human rationality [37]. Another study explores models like Claude 2,\nGPT-3.5, and GPT-4 in processing game strategy and spatial information through Tic-Tac-Toe, finding that prompt\ndesign significantly impacts performance [38].\nGTBENCH evaluates LLMs’ strategic reasoning in competitive game-theoretic tasks [39]. It features 10 tasks covering\ncomplete vs. incomplete information, dynamic vs. static, and probabilistic vs. deterministic scenarios. Results show\nLLMs struggle in complete, deterministic games but perform better in probabilistic ones. Commercial LLMs like\nGPT-4 outperform open-source models such as CodeLlama-34b-Instruct. Code-pretraining aids strategic reasoning, but\nadvanced methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought do not consistently help. Detailed error profiles\nare provided to understand LLM behaviors [39].\nGAMEBENCH evaluates strategic reasoning in LLMs across nine game environments, each highlighting key reasoning\nskills [40]. Using GPT-3 and GPT-4, along with Chain-of-Thought prompting and Reasoning Via Planning (RAP),\nthe study finds that while these frameworks improve performance, no model matches human capabilities, with GPT-4\nsometimes performing worse than random actions. The games are selected to avoid overlap with the models’ pretraining\ncorpuses.\nIn a previous study, the authors evaluated the strategic thinking capabilities of various LLMs, including Claude 2.1,\nGemini-Pro 1.0, GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, Llama2-70B, and Mistral Large, by having them play Tic-Tac-Toe through a\n3\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nmobile app [41]. This study builds upon that research with additional games, more in-depth analysis, and a user-friendly\nweb-based game simulation software to evaluate more recent LLMs.\nA recent survey paper explores the state of the art in applying LLMs to gaming, identifying the various roles LLMs\ncan play within games. It highlights underexplored areas and promising directions for future research, reconciling the\npotential and limitations of LLMs in the gaming domain. This survey aims to serve as a foundation for future research\nand innovation in this emerging field [42].\nAnother recent survey paper explores LLM-based game agents and their role in advancing toward AGI. It introduces\nthe conceptual architecture centered on perception, memory, thinking, role-playing, action, and learning. The paper\nreviews methodologies and adaptation agility of existing LLM-based game agents across six game genres: adventure,\ncommunication, competition, cooperation, simulation, and crafting & exploration. It also provides future research\ndirections in this field [43].\nThese studies collectively deepen our understanding of LLMs’ strengths and weaknesses in gaming and interactive\ncontexts, providing a foundation for future research to enhance their performance and cognitive skills. They highlight\nthe value of using games as benchmarks to expose the capabilities and limitations of current AI systems, paving the\nway for developing advanced models with sophisticated reasoning and strategic thinking.\n3\nMethodology\nWe have developed a benchmark to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in rule comprehension and decision-making\nthrough grid-based games. This benchmark includes open-source web-based software for simulating games, accessible\non GitHub [44]. The web application is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with server-side AWS Lambda\nfunctions written in Python to leverage LLMs hosted on AWS Bedrock. The game simulation web app enables LLMs\nto compete against each other, recording the details of each move for further analysis in JSON, CSV, TXT, and PNG\nformats, as well as summarizing game results.\nCurrently, the benchmark includes Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Gomoku, and is designed to be extensible to\naccommodate additional board games. A step-by-step guide for adding new game simulations is provided. As illustrated\nin Figure 1, the user interface of the game simulation web app allows users to select a game and the LLMs for the first\nand second players from a curated list. Users can also choose the type of predefined prompts (e.g., list, illustration,\nimage) and specify the number of consecutive games for the selected game, prompt, and player combination.\nFigure 1: Web-based app for game simulation shows the progress of a Connect Four game.\nThe game simulation initiates by sending the selected prompt to the web API of the chosen LLM for the first player,\nthen awaits its move. Upon receiving a response, the application updates the user interface to reflect the game’s progress,\nas demonstrated in Figure 1, subsequently queries the chosen LLM for the second player, and awaits its move. The\n4\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nprompts, which include the current state of the game, are continuously sent to each LLM’s web service until a player\nwins, the game ends in a draw, or a player is disqualified for making invalid moves. Each query and response are\nrecorded for every move. This methodology ensures seamless interaction between the application and the LLMs via\nweb API calls. The interactions are illustrated in Figure 2.\nFigure 2: The illustration of web-based app and web service interactions to play a game.\n3.1\nGames Available on the Benchmark and Possibility of Expansion to New Games\nWe have utilized three games in the benchmark; Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four and Gomoku. All of these games are\nclassical two-player games played on a grid; 3 by 3, 6 by 7, and 15 by 15, respectively [45] [46] [47]. These games can\nbe adapted to larger grids. The explanations of these games are given in Table 1 and the same explanations are used in\nthe prompts.\nTic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Gomoku are all solved games meaning their outcome (win, lose, or draw) can be\ncorrectly predicted from any position, assuming that both players play perfectly. In Tic-Tac-Toe, optimal play from\nboth participants guarantees a draw. The first player can always win with optimal play in Connect Four. In the Gomoku\ngame, the first player is guaranteed to win with optimal play [48].\nWe designed this benchmark to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new games such as checkers and chess. The\ncode is modular, facilitating the easy integration of additional games. Additionally, we prepared a step-by-step guide on\nhow to add a new game to the benchmark, which can be found on the game simulation page under the ‘How to Add\nYour Own Game’ link. We encourage interested individuals to contribute to the development of the benchmark\n3.2\nLLMs Tested & New Result Submission to the Leaderboard\nNumerous LLMs are available for evaluation. To ensure a meaningful and comprehensive assessment, we carefully\nselected LLMs based on several criteria. Firstly, we chose LLMs that are not specifically trained for the games used in\nthe benchmark. Although the training data of proprietary LLMs is not publicly disclosed, we assume they are not trained\nexplicitly for any of the benchmark games. We prioritized well-known, high-performing LLMs developed by industry\nleaders such as OpenAI and Google, given their significant contributions to AI advancements. Additionally, we included\nLLMs from emerging startup companies that have gained attention in the AI community, such as Anthropic. To further\nenrich our evaluation, we aimed to test open-source models and included Meta’s Llama3-70B model in our evaluation.\nThis selection covers a broad spectrum of innovative approaches, technological capabilities, and accessibility options.\nThe landscape of LLMs changes rapidly, with new models frequently emerging with improved capabilities. Therefore,\nwe provide game simulation software in the benchmark that generates submission files and encourage new submissions\nto the leaderboard. Contributors can evaluate other LLMs by integrating their LLM web service URL or API keys,\n5\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\ngenerating new results, and submitting them to the leaderboard. We believe the leaderboard will allow people to see the\nprogress of LLMs in different games as the leaderboard continues to be updated.\nCurrently, the benchmark includes results and detailed files for the following LLMs: Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3\nSonnet from Anthropic, Gemini 1.5 Flash and Gemini 1.5 Pro from Google, GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o from OpenAI,\nand Llama3-70B from Meta. To access these models, we utilized the web APIs provided by Google and OpenAI for the\nGemini and GPT-4 models. For accessing models from Meta and Anthropic, we employed Amazon Bedrock services,\nleveraging serverless AWS Lambda functions and API Gateways, as depicted in Figure 2.\nTo evaluate the decision-making capabilities of LLMs compared to random play, we included an option to select\n‘random play‘ as the opponent. This option generates random responses for each move. By testing all the LLMs against\nrandom play, we aim to determine the extent to which LLMs outperform random decision-making in game scenarios.\n3.3\nDetails of the Prompts\nWe utilized three types of prompts: list, illustration, and image. Each prompt is divided into eight main components:\n1) an explanation of the game, 2) an explanation of the format for the game status, 3) the current game status, 4) a\ndefinition of the LLM’s role followed by a request for its next move, 5) an explanation of the response format, 6) an\nexplanation of invalid moves, 7) a warning if the previous move was invalid, including an explanation of why it was\ndeemed invalid, and 8) the current number of invalid moves made by the player, as well as the number of invalid moves\nuntil the player is dis-qualified. The current game status, the invalid move warning, and the invalid move counts are\ndynamically generated and updated as the game progresses. Table 2 presents the components of a ’list’ type prompt for\nthe Tic-Tac-Toe game. This standardized format ensures consistency in prompts throughout the game while allowing\nfor dynamic updates of the game state.\nTable 1: Explanation of the games used in the prompts.\nTic-Tac-Toe\nTic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a 3 by 3 grid. The first player uses X symbols, and the\nsecond player uses O symbols. Players take turns placing their symbols in an empty cell on the\ngrid. The objective is to align three of your symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\nThe player who first aligns three of their symbols wins the game. Strategic placement is crucial;\nbesides aiming to align their symbols, players must also block their opponent's potential alignments\nto avoid defeat.\nConnect Four\nConnect Four is a two-player game played on a 6 by 7 grid. The first player uses red (R) discs,\nand the second player uses yellow (Y) discs. Players take turns dropping their discs into a column\nfrom the top row where there is still at least one empty space. The dropped disc falls straight down,\noccupying the lowest available row within the column. The objective is to align four of your discs\neither horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The player who first aligns four of their discs wins the\ngame. Strategic placement is crucial; besides aiming to align their discs, players must also block\ntheir opponent's potential alignments to avoid defeat.\nGomoku\nGomoku is a two-player game played on a 15 by 15 grid. The first player uses black (B) dots, and\nthe second player uses white (W) dots. Players take turns placing their dots on an empty intersection\nof the grid. The objective is to align five of your dots either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\nThe player who first aligns five of their dots wins the game. Strategic placement is crucial; besides\naiming to align their dots, players must also block their opponent's potential alignments to avoid\ndefeat.\nThe content of the three types of prompts is consistent, except for the representation of the current state of the game\n(previous moves). The ‘list’ prompt enumerates previous moves for each player in a “row, column” format. The\n‘illustration’ prompt depicts the current state of the grid using specific symbols for the first and second players (X and O\nfor Tic-Tac-Toe, R and Y for Connect Four, and B and W for Gomoku) and ’e’ for empty cells. The ‘image’ prompt\nvisualizes the current state by providing a snapshot of the game board. These differences are detailed in Table 3.\nLLMs use parameters like max tokens, temperature, top-p, and frequency penalty to fine-tune their outputs [49] [50].\nMax tokens control length, temperature adjusts creativity, top-p limits word choices to balance creativity and coherence,\nand frequency penalty reduces repetition. These settings customize LLM responses for applications such as customer\nsupport and content creation. We use default configurations for all parameters except the prompt, trusting the creators’\nfine-tuning for optimal performance.\nThe games continued until one player won, a draw occurred, or a disqualification was necessary. To gather statistical\ndata on the outcomes, each game between opponents was repeated five times. Disqualification occurred if a player\n6\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nTable 2: The parts of a prompt for the TicTacToe game.

When a player made an invalid\nmove, they were warned about the invalidity, provided with the reason (as shown in Table 2), and asked to make their\nmove again. Continuous invalid moves led to disqualification to ensure fairness and prevent indefinite delays. During\nthe game sessions conducted through the web application, data on gameplay was collected and stored in JSON, CSV,\nTXT, and PNG formats. Samples of these files are available on GitHub, along with zip files containing the complete\ndata from bulk runs performed for the results presented here. The JSON files include comprehensive details such as\ndate\/time, players, game result, duration, and all moves, covering both valid and invalid attempts. They also include the\ncurrent game status sent to the LLM and the responses received from the LLM for each move. Additionally, the JSON\nformat is used for the leaderboard submissions. A streamlined summary of the game is available in a CSV file. The\nTXT file provides an illustrated representation of the game moves, while the PNG files display snapshots of the board\nafter each move. All files generated during this study are publicly available on GitHub.\n3.4\nDetails of the Data Generated by the Game Simulation Web App\nThe data generated by the game simulation web app is downloaded as a zip file either after a ’run’ between two LLMs\nor after a ’bulk run’ between all LLMs listed as first and second players.

The sample files and zip files generated during the\n’bulk run’ of data collection for the results presented in this study are available on the GitHub page [44].\n3.5\nMetrics and Methods for Evaluation\nWe evaluated the performance of LLMs across three games (Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Gomoku) using different\nprompt types (list, illustration, and image) to assess their ability to handle various formats of game state representation.\nPerformance comparisons were made against a random play strategy to establish a baseline, highlighting the strategic\nadvantages of the LLMs. The primary metrics for evaluation included win rates, draw rates, and disqualification\nrates, providing an overview of the LLMs’ performance as both the first and second players. Additionally, we tracked\nthe number of invalid moves per game and the average number of moves per game to assess rule adherence and\ngame engagement. To delve deeper into the LLMs’ strategic thinking, we analyzed missed opportunities to win\nor block an opponent’s win, counting instances where the LLMs failed to make critical moves. We presented the\nmissed opportunities per game by averaging the missed opportunities across all games that resulted in a win, draw, or\ndisqualification. We also normalized the number of missed opportunities by the number of valid moves to calculate the\npercentage of missed opportunities per valid move. The results were visualized through charts and tables to provide\na clear depiction of performance metrics and trends, as shown in the Results section.

The chart\nsummarizes the performance of the seven LLMs as well as random play in terms of win rates, draw rates, and dis-\nqualification rates as both the first and second players. Claude 3.5 Sonnet has the highest winning percentage as the first\nplayer (88.57%) but a lower winning percentage as the second player (17.14%). GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro show\nstrong performance as both the first and second players, while random play results in the highest disqualification rates\nFigure 3: Tic-Tac-Toe game outcomes using the ‘list’ prompt where each LLM faced six others and the ‘random play’\nas both player 1 and player 2, playing each opponent 5 times (280 games total).\nFigure 4 displays the performance metrics of seven LLMs and a random play strategy in terms of win rates, draw rates,\nand disqualification rates when playing Tic-Tac-Toe as the first and second player, based on the illustration prompt\nformat. The chart shows significant performance variations among the LLMs, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet exhibiting the\nhighest winning rates as the first player, indicating a strong strategic advantage. Llama3-70B and GPT-4 Turbo also\ndemonstrate strong performance. Disqualification rates are generally low but notable for some models, such as Gemini\n1.5 Flash, indicating occasional invalid moves. The random player serves as a baseline comparison, with lower winning\nrates and higher disqualification rates, highlighting the superior strategic capabilities of the LLMs.\nFigure 5 displays the performance metrics of various LLMs and a random play strategy in terms of win rates, draw\nrates, and disqualification rates when playing Tic-Tac-Toe as the first and second player, based on the image prompt\nformat. Key observations indicate that Claude 3.5 Sonnet has a high disqualification rate as both the first (46.67%) and\nsecond player (53.33%), indicating a struggle with rule compliance. Similarly, GPT-4 Turbo and Gemini 1.5 Pro also\nshow significant disqualification rates. GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o exhibit the highest winning rates. The random play\nbaseline has high disqualification rates, highlighting the strategic advantages of LLMs compared to random strategies.\nNo draws occurred in the Tic-Tac-Toe games using the image prompt. Llama3-70B does not accept images, so it was\nnot used when testing any of the games with the image prompt type.\nThe chart in Figure 6 displays the performance metrics of various LLMs and a random play strategy in terms of win\nrates, draw rates, and disqualification rates when playing Connect Four as the first and second player using the list\nprompt type. Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 1.5 Pro show outstanding performance with a high winning rate of 88.57%\nas the first player. Most LLMs demonstrated strong performance when considering their total win rates as both first\nand second players. The random player, serving as a baseline, has lower winning rates and some disqualifications,\nhighlighting the strategic advantages of the LLMs. No draws occurred in the Connect Four games using the list prompt.\nFigure 7 presents the performance metrics of various LLMs and a random play strategy in terms of win rates and\ndisqualification rates when playing Connect Four as the first and second player using the illustration prompt type.\nGPT-4 Turbo has the highest disqualification rates as both the first and second players.

The random play baseline has the lowest\nwinning rates. No draws occurred during the matches between the opponents.\nFigure 9 displays the performance metrics of various LLMs and a random play strategy in terms of win rates and\ndisqualification rates when playing Gomoku as the first and second player using the list prompt. Claude 3.5 Sonnet\ndemonstrates exceptional performance with a 94.29% win rate as the first player and 25.71% win rate as the second\nplayer, with no disqualifications. Claude 3 Sonnet also performs well with an 85.71% win rate as the first player and\n25.71% win rate as the second player, maintaining a clean record. Gemini 1.5 Pro has a high win rate of 71.43% as the\nfirst player and 45.71% as the second player but exhibits an 11.43% disqualification rate as both the first and second\nplayer. GPT-4 Turbo stands out with a 74.29% win rate as the first player and 37.14% win rate as the second player,\nshowing minimal disqualifications.

Significant disqualification rates\nare evident among several LLMs, particularly when playing as the second player, indicating challenges in adhering\nto the game’s rules. Models like Gemini 1.5 Flash and Llama3-70B had high disqualification rates. Winning rates\nvary widely, with some models showing strong performance as the first player while struggling as the second player.\nThe notable disqualification rates suggest that strategic complexity and rule comprehension are significant factors\naffecting LLM performance. Overall, the chart highlights the variability in strategic abilities and reliability of different\nLLMs, emphasizing the need for further improvements in their rule adherence and strategic planning capabilities. The\nrandom play baseline, with no recorded wins, draws, or disqualifications, underscores the superior strategic thinking\nand performance of the LLMs despite their challenges.\nFigure 11 illustrates the performance metrics of various LLMs and a random play strategy in terms of win rates and\ndisqualification rates when playing Gomoku as the first and second player using the image prompt type. A notable\n12\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nFigure 8: Connect Four game outcomes using the ‘image’ prompt where each LLM faced five others and the ‘random\nplay’ as both player 1 and player 2, playing each opponent 5 times (210 games total).\nFigure 9: Gomoku game outcomes using the ‘list’ prompt where each LLM faced six others and the ‘random play’ as\nboth player 1 and play-er 2, playing each opponent 5 times (280 games total).\npattern is the high disqualification rates for some models, particularly when playing as the second player, suggesting\ndifficulties in rule adherence. There is a marked variation in win rates among the models, with some achieving higher\nsuccess as the first player. The random player baseline demonstrates no recorded wins, draws, or disqualifications.\nThe chart in Figure 12 illustrates the performance of LLMs and a random play strategy in terms of moves per game and\ninvalid moves per game when they participated as both first and second players in Tic-Tac-Toe across three prompt\ntypes: list, illustration, and image. The random play strategy serves as a baseline, indicating performance without\nstrategic thinking. Generally, the number of moves per game increases with the complexity of the prompt, with image\nprompts resulting in the highest number of moves across all models. For list prompts, LLM performance ranged from\n6.46 to 7.43 moves per game, while random play showed a higher number at 10.11. Illustration prompts saw a slight\nincrease in moves for most models, peaking with Gemini 1.5 Flash. Invalid moves were minimal for list prompts but\nincreased significantly for illustration prompts, particularly for Gemini 1.5 Flash, and were highest for image prompts,\nnotably for Claude 3 Sonnet and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Random play consistently exhibited higher invalid moves across all\nprompt types, underscoring its lack of strategic planning compared to the LLMs. Llama3-70B was not used for the\nimage prompt since it cannot accept images.\nThe chart in Figure 13 compares the performance of LLMs and a random play strategy in terms of moves per game\nand invalid moves per game, when they participated as both first and second players, for Connect Four across three\n13\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nFigure 10: Gomoku game outcomes using the ‘illustration’ prompt where each LLM faced six others and the ‘random\nplay’ as both player 1 and player 2, playing each opponent 5 times (280 games total).\nFigure 11: Gomoku game outcomes using the ‘image’ prompt where each LLM faced five others and the ‘random play’\nas both player 1 and player 2, playing each opponent 5 times (210 games total).\nprompt types: list, illustration, and image. Overall, the number of moves per game tends to increase with the complexity\nof the prompt, with the highest number of moves observed in the image prompt format. For list prompts, the LLMs\ndemonstrated consistent moves per game with minimal invalid moves. However, there was a significant increase in\ninvalid moves in the illustration prompts for GPT-4 Turbo and in the image prompts for Claude 3 Sonnet. Notably,\nrandom play showed relatively lower invalid moves, likely because invalid moves (already taken slots) can only occur\nwhen all rows of a column are filled in Connect Four. These results highlight the challenges faced by LLMs in handling\nmore complex and visually demanding prompt formats.\nFigure 14 illustrates the performance of LLMs and a random play strategy in terms of moves per game and invalid\nmoves per game for Gomoku, across list, illustration, and image prompt types. Generally, the number of moves per\ngame and the number of invalid moves per game increases for LLMs with the complexity of the prompt, with the highest\nmoves recorded in the image prompt format. Invalid moves are minimal in list prompts but increase significantly in\nillustration and image prompts, especially for models like Gemini 1.5 Flash, GPT-4 Turbo, and Llama3-70B. Random\nplay shows relatively fewer invalid moves, as it is less likely to place a move on an already occupied space before the\ngame has progressed significantly in the 15 by 15 grid of Gomoku. This chart highlights the challenges LLMs face in\nhandling more complex and visually demanding prompt formats.\n14\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nFigure 12: Moves per game and invalid moves (already taken) per game for Tic-Tac-Toe.\nFigure 13: Moves per game and invalid moves (already taken) per game for Connect Four.\nWe analyzed the strategic decision-making capabilities of LLMs by counting instances where they missed opportunities\nto win or block an opponent’s win with one move. For example, in Tic-Tac-Toe, if the first player had two of its symbols\nin a row along with an empty space and did not place its next move in that space to win the game, it was counted as a\nmissed opportunity to win. Similarly, if the second player did not place its next move in the empty space to block the\nfirst player from winning after the first player had two symbols in a row, it was recorded as a missed opportunity to\nblock. Our analysis covered 70 games per LLM for the list and illustration prompt types, and 60 games per LLM for\nthe image prompt type.\nFigure 15 presents the frequency of missed opportunities to win or avoid a loss per Tic-Tac-Toe game. LLMs generally\nperformed better by missing fewer opportunities in list prompts compared to illustration and image prompts. Claude 3.5\nSonnet showed the fewest missed opportunities to win in the list and illustration prompts, while GPT-4 Turbo showed\nthe fewest in the image prompt. The frequency of missed opportunities to block an opponent’s win was generally higher\nacross all prompt types, with Gemini 1.5 Flash facing notable challenges in the illustration prompts.\nIn general, missing fewer win and block opportunities per game indicates better performance for an LLM. However,\nif an LLM makes many invalid moves and gets disqualified without creating any opportunities to win, the number of\nmissed opportunities to win will be zero, falsely suggesting no missed opportunities. To avoid such confusion in the\ninterpretation of results and to further analyze performance, we normalized the missed opportunities by using the number\nof valid moves and calculated the percentage of opportunities missed per valid move. The chart in Figure 16 shows\nthe percentage of missed win and block opportunities per valid move for various LLMs in Tic-Tac-Toe across three\nprompt types: list, illustration, and image. The blue bars rep-resent the percentage of missed win opportunities, while\nthe orange bars represent the percentage of missed block opportunities. Generally, LLMs missed fewer opportunities in\n15\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nFigure 14: Moves per game and invalid moves (already taken) per game for Gomoku.\nFigure 15: Strategic move opportunities missed per Tic-Tac-Toe game.\nthe list prompts compared to illustration and image prompts. For instance, Claude 3.5 Sonnet had a 9% missed win\nopportunity rate and 20% missed block opportunity rate for list prompts, while it missed 21% and 28%, respectively,\nfor illustration prompts. Similarly, GPT-4 Turbo had a notable increase in missed block opportunities for illustration\nprompts. The trend is consistent across other models, indicating that LLMs face greater challenges in handling visually\ncomplex prompts, leading to higher rates of missed strategic opportunities. The chart highlights that while LLMs\ncan identify winning moves, they often struggle more with blocking opponents’ winning moves, especially as prompt\ncomplexity increases.\nFigure 17 shows the performance of various LLMs in terms of missed opportunities to either win or block the opponent\nfrom winning in Connect Four. In Connect Four, if a player had three of its discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or\ndiagonally) along with an empty slot and did not place its next move in that slot to complete four in a row and win the\ngame, it was counted as a missed opportunity to win. Similarly, if the opponent did not place its next move in the empty\nslot to block the first player from winning once the first player had achieved three discs in a row, it was recorded as a\nmissed opportunity to block. According to the chart, LLMs tend to miss more opportunities to block than to win. For\nexample, in the list prompt format, Claude 3 Sonnet has a high rate of missed opportunities to block at 1.28 per game,\nwhile it misses 0.88 opportunities to win. Similarly, Gemini 1.5 Flash misses 0.95 opportunities to block and 0.22 to\nwin. This trend is consistent across other models and prompt types, indicating a common difficulty among LLMs in\nanticipating the opponent’s winning moves. In the image prompt format, Claude 3.5 Sonnet misses 0.68 opportunities\n16\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nFigure 16: Percentage of strategic move opportunities missed per Tic-Tac-Toe valid move.\nto block and 0.97 to win, indicating challenges in both defensive and offensive strategies. In the illustration prompt,\nGPT-4o and Claude 3 Sonnet miss the most opportunities compared to other LLMs.\nFigure 17: Strategic move opportunities missed per Connect Four game.\nGPT-4 Turbo appears to miss fewer opportunities than other LLMs in the illustration prompt format. However, a careful\nanalysis of the previous chart in Figure 7 reveals that GPT-4 Turbo had a disqualification rate of 82.66% as the first\nplayer and 68.57% as the second player out of a total of 70 games using the illustration prompt in Connect Four. These\nrates are significantly higher than those of other LLMs. Further review of Figure 13 shows that GPT-4 Turbo averaged\n13.49 invalid moves per game out of 23.43 moves, which is again significantly more than other LLMs. While GPT-4\nTurbo seems to have missed fewer opportunities, this may result from not having many valid moves. To gain better\ninsight into the LLMs’ strategic capabilities in utilizing opportunities, we focused on valid moves and analyzed the\npercentage of missed win and block opportunities per valid move. Figure 18 shows the results of this analysis. For list\nprompts, Claude 3 Sonnet missed the most block opportunities. In illustration prompts, Llama3-70B and GPT-4 Turbo\nperformed better. In image prompts, missed block opportunities were notably higher for Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini\n1.5 Pro.\n17\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nFigure 18: Percentage of strategic move opportunities missed per Connect Four valid move.\nAccording to the chart in Figure 19, LLMs generally miss more opportunities to win than to block in the Gomoku\ngame. In Gomoku, if a player has four stones in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) and an empty space\nbut does not place its next move in that space to complete five in a row, it is counted as a missed opportunity to win.\nSimilarly, if the opponent does not place its next move in the empty space to block the first player from winning once\nthe first player has four stones in a row, it is recorded as a missed opportunity to block. In the list prompt format, both\nClaude 3 Sonnet and Gemini 1.5 Flash miss approximately 1.87 opportunities to win per game, while their missed\nopportunities to block are slightly lower. In the illustration prompt format, Gemini 1.5 Flash misses 1.7 opportunities to\nwin and 0.82 to block. This trend indicates that while LLMs can often identify opportunities to block, they struggle\nmore with recognizing and capitalizing on winning opportunities. In the image prompt format, GPT-4o exhibits the\nhighest number of missed opportunities, with 1.34 missed chances to win and 1.32 to block per game. This highlights\nsignificant challenges for LLMs in processing and acting upon image-based inputs. Overall, the chart emphasizes that\nwhile LLMs are reasonably adept at blocking the opponent’s winning moves, they face greater difficulty in identifying\nand seizing their own winning opportunities, especially in more complex and visually demanding formats.\nFigure 19: Strategic move opportunities missed per Gomoku game.\n18\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nIn Figure 20, we further analyzed the missed opportunities by normalizing them per valid move, as we did in Figure\n16 for Tic-Tac-Toe and Figure 18 for Connect Four. Figure 20 displays the percentage of missed win and block\nopportunities per valid move for various LLMs in Gomoku across three prompt types: list, illustration, and image.\nGenerally, the LLMs show a higher percentage of missed block opportunities compared to win opportunities across\nall prompt types. In list prompts, Gemini 1.5 Flash missed the most block opportunities. Gemini 1.5 Pro performed\nthe best with no missed opportunities for illustration prompts. In image prompts, GPT-4 Turbo performed the best in\nminimizing missed opportunities.\nFigure 20: Percentage of strategic move opportunities missed per Gomoku valid move.\nUtilizing the Game Simulation web app to generate data for new LLMs or the open-access data available on GitHub for\nthe LLMs assessed here, further analysis can be conducted. For instance, analyzing the creation of winning opportunities\ncan provide additional insights. This can be achieved by counting instances where the LLM creates potential winning\nopportunities (i.e., aligning two moves for Tic-Tac-Toe, three moves for Connect Four, and four moves for Gomoku).\nSuch analysis can reveal that a high number of created opportunities may indicate proactive strategic thinking by the\nLLMs. Contributions to the repository with suggestions and new evaluation metrics are encouraged to enhance the\nassessment of LLM capabilities in grid-based games.\nFigures 21, 22 and 23 summarize the outcomes of 2,310 games played between seven LLMs and a random play\ngenerator across different prompt types (list, illustration, image) for the games Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Gomoku,\nrespectively. As shown in these results matrices, the LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of success across different\ngames and prompt types. Models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and Gemini 1.5 Pro showed strong performance in\nsimpler formats but struggled with more complex prompts. Random play consistently had the highest number of invalid\nmoves, highlighting its lack of strategy. The data suggests that while some LLMs handle simpler game prompts well,\nmore complex formats reveal significant challenges in their decision-making processes. In the result matrices, the W\ncolumn shows the total number of games the LLM won as the first and second player, D indicates draws, and Q shows\nthe total number of games the LLM was disqualified as the first and second player. Each LLM played 5 games with\neach corresponding opponent for each game and prompt type combination, totaling 35 games per player for list and\nillustration prompts, and 30 games per player for the image prompt type. The lower game count for the image prompt\ntype is because Llama3-70B cannot accept images and therefore was not used with the image prompt type. The result\nmatrix is also hosted on the project’s GitHub page.\nFigure 24 displays a portion of the leaderboard page of the LLM Game Benchmark, summarizing the results of games\nplayed between various LLMs and a random play generator. Key metrics on the leaderboard include win ratios, number\nof wins, dis-qualifications, invalid moves, and total moves for both the first and second players.

Each LLM played five\ngames per game and prompt type against each opponent, resulting in a total of 2,310 games for analysis.\nThe performance of the LLMs varied significantly across different games and prompt types. Simpler games like\nTic-Tac-Toe experienced fewer invalid moves and disqualifications compared to more complex games like Connect\nFour and Gomoku, highlighting the models’ varying capacities to handle increasing game complexity. LLMs performed\nbetter with list prompts for Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect Four, while more complex prompt formats, particularly illustration\nand image prompts, revealed challenges in strategic decision-making. These formats led to higher disqualification rates\nand missed strategic opportunities, indicating difficulties in interpreting visual data and maintaining consistency.\nThe random play strategy consistently recorded the highest number of losses and invalid moves, serving as a useful\nbaseline for gauging LLM performance. The stark contrast between random play and the LLMs underscores the models’\ncapacity for strategic decision-making, though there remains room for improvement in handling complex and visual\ndata.\nIn Tic-Tac-Toe, LLMs demonstrated strong performance with list prompts, exhibiting minimal invalid moves, indicating\na good understanding of the game’s basic rules. Performance declined with illustration prompts, as some LLMs\n1LLM Grid-Based Game Leaderboard: https:\/\/research-outcome.github.io\/LLM-Game-Benchmark\/leaderboard\/\n20\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nFigure 22: The results matrix showing the outcomes of matches between seven LLMs and a random play generator\nsoftware across different games for Connect Four.\nshowed increased invalid moves, suggesting challenges in interpreting visual prompts. The most significant decline was\nobserved with image prompts, where many LLMs displayed a high number of in-valid moves, highlighting difficulties\nin processing and responding to image-based prompts.\nIn Connect Four, LLMs generally performed well with list prompts, although some showed increased invalid moves\ncompared to Tic-Tac-Toe, reflecting the higher complexity of Connect Four. A significant increase in invalid moves and\ndisqualifications was observed with both illustration and image prompts, indicating substantial challenges in visual\ninterpretation and decision-making in a more complex game context.\nFor Gomoku, performance was mixed across all prompt types, with a notable increase in invalid moves and disqualifica-\ntions. This game, being more complex and less common, likely posed significant interpretative and decision-making\nchallenges for the LLMs.\nDifferent prompt types had a notable impact on the performance of the LLMs. List prompts were generally well-handled\nby all LLMs, suggesting that textual representation of game states is within their current capabilities. Illustration\nprompts posed moderate challenges, as reflected in the increased number of invalid moves, indicating that graphical\nrepresentations are harder for LLMs to interpret. Image prompts were the most challenging, with the highest number of\ninvalid moves, highlighting a significant area for improvement in LLMs’ ability to process and act on image-based\ninputs.\nInvalid moves analysis revealed no out-of-bounds errors in any games, unlike in our previous study. This improvement\nis likely due to updated prompts that clearly define the range of possible column and row values. Invalid format errors\nwere made only by GPT-4 Turbo and Gemini 1.5 Flash, mostly due to hallucinated tag names in the JSON format.\nGPT-4 Turbo made several invalid format errors in Tic-Tac-Toe and Gomoku games for list and illustration prompt types,\nwhile Gemini 1.5 Flash made several errors during Gomoku games for illustration and image prompts.

Future work can include a broader\nrange of games and tasks to evaluate LLMs across different strategic environments.\n6\nLimitations and Future Directions\nThe study’s methodology primarily focuses on grid-based games, which, while useful, may not fully capture the breadth\nof real-world strategic interactions. Future benchmarks should incorporate a wider variety of game types, including\nthose with more complex rules and longer-term strategic planning, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of\nLLM capabilities. Designing new, custom, purpose-built games to test specific aspects of LLM capabilities, such as\nadapting to unusual rules, would enhance benchmarking effectiveness and prevent the possibility of LLMs becoming\nfamiliar with the game, even if they were not specifically trained for it.\nThe simplicity of the games used in this benchmark facilitates basic evaluation but may not challenge LLMs’ strategic\ncapabilities as much as more complex games like chess or Go might. The fact that current LLMs have not mastered\neven these simple games provides valuable insights into their capabilities and limitations. Expanding the evaluation to\nlarger grids, such as 4 × 4 or 5 × 5 for Tic-Tac-Toe or 19 × 19 for Gomoku, could present additional challenges and\nprovide a clearer indicator of LLM performance.\nRelying on predefined prompts to guide LLMs’ moves may not adequately capture their potential for independent\nstrategic thinking or their ability to respond to changing game states. Although we updated prompts dynamically to\nwarn LLMs of invalid moves, further techniques, such as providing all previous invalid moves, could be explored to\nreduce invalid move numbers and disqualifications.\nThis study tested LLMs using structured prompts. Future research should investigate how these prompts influence LLM\nperformance and how variations in prompt structure might affect their understanding of game states and subsequent\nmoves. Such insights could help optimize LLMs for more complex and varied applications.\nThe evaluation metrics used in this study revealed a wide range of LLM capabilities. While these metrics provide a\ngood indication of performance, they may not fully capture the strategic complexity of the models. Further analysis\nof the moves—drawn from the JSON and PNG files—could offer a more detailed assessment of game progress over\ntime. The new analysis can be conducted using the Game Simulation web app to generate data for new LLMs or the\nopen-access data on GitHub. For example, evaluating the creation of winning opportunities, such as aligning moves\nfor Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Gomoku, can provide insights into proactive strategic thinking by the LLMs. The\nauthors encourage and welcome contributions to the repository in the form of suggestions and implementations of new\nmetrics and methods to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs.\nFocusing on a select group of LLMs might not capture the full diversity of strategic approaches across available models,\nhighlighting the importance of including a broader array in future research. The rapidly expanding landscape of LLMs,\nwith new models and improved versions emerging frequently, necessitates continuous updates to benchmarks. We\nwelcome submissions of other and new LLMs using the open-source game simulation software.\nFuture work could explore several promising directions to extend research and deepen our understanding of LLM\ncapabilities in strategic games and beyond. Multi-agent collaboration scenarios, where multiple LLMs work together\nagainst a common opponent or compete in teams, could assess their abilities in coordination, cooperation, and\ncompetitive strategy. Comparing newer versions of LLMs against those tested in this study could track progress and\nimprovements in AI strategic gaming capabilities over time.\nThis study suggests several avenues for future research and development. Firstly, improving LLMs’ abilities to interpret\nand act on visual data is crucial, as evidenced by high invalid move rates in illustration and image prompts. Enhancing\nvisual processing capabilities could significantly boost overall performance and utility. Secondly, further research is\nneeded to enhance LLMs’ decision-making processes in more complex environments.\n7\nConclusion\nThis study introduces a novel and extensible benchmark for LLMs through grid-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe,\nConnect Four, and Gomoku. The open-source game simulation code, available on GitHub, enables LLMs to compete\nand generates data files in JSON, CSV, TXT, and PNG formats for leaderboard rankings and further analysis. We\npresent the results of games among leading LLMs, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Sonnet by Anthropic,\nGemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash by Google, GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o by OpenAI, and Llama3-70B by Meta,\nand encourage submissions from other LLMs. By analyzing the performance of these models over 2,310 games,\nwe observed significant variations in their capabilities, particularly highlighting their struggles with complex and\n23\nEvaluating LLMs with Grid-Based Game Competitions - An Extensible Benchmark & Leaderboard\nvisually-based prompt formats. Comparisons with a random play generator underscore the LLMs’ superior yet still\ndeveloping capacity for strategic decision-making.\nThe study reveals that while LLMs perform relatively well in simpler formats, such as list prompts for Tic-Tac-Toe\nand Connect Four, their performance declines with more complex prompts, especially those involving illustrations and\nimages. This trend indicates the current limitations in LLMs’ ability to interpret and act on visual data and manage\nincreased game complexity. Additionally, the models showed a tendency to make invalid moves when faced with more\ncomplex prompts, underscoring the need for improved strategic decision-making processes.\nSeveral areas for further investigation could be explored, such as expanding the types and complexity of games used for\nevaluation, testing more sophisticated prompt engineering techniques, and delving deeper into the effects of different\nprompt structures.\nThe findings of this study have broader implications beyond gaming, suggesting that advancements in LLMs’ strategic\nthinking and decision-making abilities could enhance their application in fields such as robotics, autonomous systems,\nand interactive AI. Furthermore, the modular and open-source nature of the benchmarking framework encourages\ncommunity contributions, which can lead to a more dynamic and comprehensive evaluation of LLM capabilities.\nIn conclusion, while the current evaluation highlights both the strengths and limitations of LLMs, it also points to\nthe need for ongoing research to enhance their ability to process complex and visual data, improve decision-making\nprocesses, and develop more sophisticated benchmarking tools. This continuous development will ultimately broaden\nthe applicability and effectiveness of LLMs in various real-world tasks.\nAcknowledgments\nThis study was partially supported by Florida Polytechnic University with grant number GR-24SUMR-OT.\n```\n\n#### 5. 学生问题\n问题1：介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」\n问题2：这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？\n问题3：这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？\n\n\n请输出论文总结\n### 输出格式（输出语言用中文）\n```\n## 💡 解答问题1 (...复述学生问题1...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (...复述学生问题2...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (...复述学生问题3...)\n...\n```\n","llm_summary_res":"## 🌟 论文解读 | 通过基于网格的游戏竞赛评估大型语言模型：一个可扩展的LLM基准和排行榜\n\n## 📌 背景痛点\/本文动机\n随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在人工智能领域的快速发展，评估这些模型的能力和性能变得至关重要。传统的评估方法，如准确率、精确率等，已经无法全面评估LLMs的复杂能力。因此，需要新的基准来评估LLMs在规则理解、战略思考和决策制定等方面的能力。\n\n## 🚀 核心方法\n💡 创新点1：基于网格的游戏竞赛\n本文提出了一种新颖且可扩展的基准，通过网格游戏（如井字棋、四子棋和五子棋）来评估LLMs的能力。这些游戏需要模型理解规则、制定策略并做出决策，从而全面评估LLMs的能力。\n\n💡 创新点2：开放源代码和排行榜\n本文提供了一个开源的游戏模拟代码，允许LLMs进行竞赛，并生成详细的JSON、CSV、TXT和PNG格式的数据文件，用于排行榜排名和进一步分析。此外，本文还提供了一个排行榜，展示了不同LLMs在不同游戏和提示类型下的表现。\n\n## 📈 实验结果\n本文对七个领先的LLMs进行了评估，包括Anthropic的Claude 3.5 Sonnet和Claude 3 Sonnet、Google的Gemini 1.5 Pro和Gemini 1.5 Flash、OpenAI的GPT-4 Turbo和GPT-4o以及Meta的Llama3-70B。实验结果表明，LLMs在不同游戏和提示类型下的表现存在显著差异。例如，Claude 3.5 Sonnet在井字棋中表现出色，但在五子棋中表现较差。此外，LLMs在处理复杂和基于视觉的提示格式时也面临挑战。\n\n## 💬 可借鉴之处\n本文提出的基于网格的游戏竞赛基准为评估LLMs的能力提供了一个有价值的工具。此外，本文还提供了一个开放源代码和排行榜，方便研究人员进行进一步的分析和比较。本文的研究结果对于理解LLMs的能力和局限性具有重要意义，并为未来的研究和开发提供了方向。","llm_summary_res_status":200,"order":8,"query_answer":"## 💡 解答问题1 (介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」)\n\n这篇论文提出了一种新颖且可扩展的基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的能力。该基准通过网格游戏（如井字棋、四子棋和五子棋）来评估LLMs的能力。这些游戏需要模型理解规则、制定策略并做出决策，从而全面评估LLMs的能力。该基准提供了一个开源的游戏模拟代码，允许LLMs进行竞赛，并生成详细的JSON、CSV、TXT和PNG格式的数据文件，用于排行榜排名和进一步分析。此外，该基准还提供了一个排行榜，展示了不同LLMs在不同游戏和提示类型下的表现。\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？)\n\n论文中并未明确说明该benchmark所需的设备条件，例如GPU数量和内存大小。然而，由于该benchmark是基于网格游戏，并且需要与LLMs进行交互，因此可能需要一定的计算资源来支持LLMs的推理过程。论文中提到，为了访问模型，使用了Google和OpenAI提供的web APIs，以及Amazon Bedrock服务，利用了serverless AWS Lambda函数和API网关。这表明，该benchmark可能需要云服务提供商的支持，以便能够访问和运行LLMs。\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？)\n\n论文中并未明确说明该benchmark是否具有高质量的结果奖励或过程奖励，以防止reward hacking。然而，由于该benchmark是基于网格游戏，并且需要LLMs理解规则、制定策略并做出决策，因此可能需要LLMs具备一定的战略思考和决策制定能力。这可能会使得RL类模型在该benchmark上表现出色，因为RL类模型通常擅长于通过试错学习和优化策略。然而，由于该benchmark的复杂性，LLMs可能需要大量的训练和调整才能在该benchmark上取得良好的表现。","query_answer_status":200}

Real-\nworld data is often stored in well-structured\ndatabases that contain tabular fields, with textual\nand visual fields co-occurring. Numerous auto-\nmated classification systems have been deployed\non these multimodal data to provide efficient and\nscalable services. For instance, medical decision\nsupport systems (Soenksen et al., 2022) utilize pa-\ntients’ electronic health record data that contains\ntabular inputs (e.g., ages, genders, races), textual\ninputs (e.g., notes, prescriptions, written reports),\nand visual inputs (e.g., x-rays, magnetic resonance\nimaging, ct-scans) to help precise disease predic-\ntion. Similarly, e-commerce product classification\nsystems (Erickson et al., 2022) categorize prod-\nucts based on their categorical\/numerical quanti-\n*These authors contributed equally to this work\nname: Clawfury Adept\ntext: Give all other friendly \ncharacters +1 attack this turn\nattack: 2\nhealth: 3\ncost: 2\nrarity: Common\ntype: Minion\ncardClass =?

Therefore, accurate classification\nmodels for table-text-image input are desired.\nDeep neural networks have shown significant\nprogress in multimodal learning tasks, such as\nCLIP (Radford et al., 2021) for image-text re-\ntrieval and Fuse-Transformer (Shi et al., 2021)\nfor tabular-with-text classification. This progress\nhas been made with large-scale datasets provided\nto train the data-eager models. So far, there ex-\nist many datasets (Ovalle et al., 2017; Wu et al.,\n2021; Shi et al., 2021; Qu et al., 2022; Lin et al.,\n2020; Lee et al., 2019; Kautzky et al., 2020; Srini-\nvasan et al., 2021) that cover one or two modali-\nties. However, the progress in tabular-text-image\nmultimodal learning lags due to the lack of avail-\nable resources. In this paper, we provide a mul-\ntimodal benchmark, namely MUG, that contains\neight datasets for researchers to examine their al-\narXiv:2302.02978v2  [cs.LG]  17 Oct 2023\ngorithms’ multimodal perception ability. MUG\ncontains data samples with tabular, textual, and vi-\nsual fields that are collected from various genres of\ngames. We have made necessary cleaning, transfor-\nmations, and modifications to the original data to\nmake MUG easy to use. We further conduct com-\nprehensive data analysis to demonstrate the diverse\nand multimodal-dependent properties of MUG.\nMUG can enable future studies of many mul-\ntimodal tasks, and we focus on the multimodal\nclassification task in this paper. For the primary\nclassification evaluation, we incorporate two state-\nof-the-art (SOTA) unimodal classifiers for each of\nthe three input modalities, resulting in a total of\nsix, along with two SOTA multimodal classifiers.\nWe also propose a novel baseline model MUGNET\nbased on the graph attention network (Veliˇckovi´c\net al., 2018).\nIn addition to capturing the in-\nteractions among the three input modalities, our\nMUGNET takes the sample-wise similarity into\naccount, yielding a compatible performance to ex-\nisting multimodal classifiers. We further conduct\nefficiency evaluations to reflect the practical re-\nquirements of many machine learning systems.\n2\nRelated Works\n2.1\nMultimodal Classification Datasets with\nTabular, Textual, and Visual Fields\nMachine learning models in real-world applications\nneed to deal with multimodal data that contains\nboth tabular, textual, and visual fields. Due to pri-\nvacy or license issues, there exist very few datasets\nthat cover these three modalities. To the best of our\nknowledge, PetFinder1 is one of the few publicly\navailable datasets. HAIM-MIMIC-MM (Soenksen\net al., 2022) is a multimodal healthcare dataset\ncontaining tabular, textual, image, and time-series\nfields. However, only credentialed users can access\nHAIM-MIMIC-MM. On the other hand, there exist\nmany datasets that cover two modalities (out of\ntable, text, and image modalities). The most com-\nmon datasets are the ones with both textual and\nvisual features (MM-IMDB (Ovalle et al., 2017),\nV-SNLI (Vu et al., 2018), MultiOFF (Suryawan-\nshi et al., 2020), WIT (Srinivasan et al., 2021),\nMELINDA (Wu et al., 2021), etc.). Meanwhile,\n(Shi et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2019; Qu et al., 2022)\nprovide benchmark datasets for table and text\nmodalities, For the combination of table and image\n1PetFinder: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/competitions\/\npetfinder-adoption-prediction\/overview\nmodalities, there are a bunch of datasets from the\nmedical domain (Lin et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2019;\nKautzky et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2020). Other\nthan the mentioned table, text, and image modali-\nties, multimodal learning has also been conducted\nin time-series, speech, and video modalities (Zhang\net al., 2022, 2020; Li et al., 2020).\n2.2\nMultimodal Classifiers for Tabular,\nTextual, and Visual Fields\nFusion is the core technology for multimodal classi-\nfication problems, which integrates data from each\ninput modality and utilizes fused representations\nfor downstream tasks (classification, regression,\nretrieval, etc.). Based on the stage of fusion (Iv\net al., 2021), existing methods can be divided into\nearly, late, or hybrid fusion. Early fusion mod-\nels (Sun et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2021; Zhu et al.,\n2021) usually fuse raw data or extracted features\nbefore they are fed into the learnable classifier,\nwhile late fusion models (Erickson et al., 2020;\nSoenksen et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2022) employ sep-\narate learnable encoders for all input modalities\nand then fuse these learned representations into\nthe learnable classifier. Hybrid fusion models are\nmore flexible, allowing for modality fusion to oc-\ncur at different stages simultaneously (Qingyun\net al., 2021; Li et al., 2021). Although existing\nworks have demonstrated remarkable capability\nin modeling feature interactions, they ignore sig-\nnals of sample proximity, such as the tendency for\nwithin a group to exhibit similar behavior or share\ncommon interests. In response, we propose our ap-\nproach, MUGNET, which dynamically constructs\ngraphs based on sample similarity and effectively\ncombines graphical representation learning with\nmultimodal fusion. Our approach draws inspira-\ntion from pioneering graph neural networks (Guo\net al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021; Georgantas and\nRichiardi, 2022), which have achieved success in\nvarious classification tasks.\n3\nMUG: the benchmark\nWe create and release MUG with eight datasets\nfor multimodal classification with tabular, text, and\nimage fields to the community for future studies.\nRaw data and examples of how to appropriately\nload the data are provided in https:\/\/github.\ncom\/lujiaying\/MUG-Bench. MUG is under the\n\"CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\" license2, and is designated to\nuse for research purposes.\n3.1\nData Sources\nTo collect multiple and large-scale datasets that\nsupport multimodal automated machine learning,\nwe collected data from four games: Pokémon,\nHearthstone, League of Legends, and Counter-\nStrike: Global Offensive. We deliberately chose\nthese video games as they have distinct video game\ngenres (e.g., role-playing, card, multiplayer online\nbattle arena, and shooting). All of these datasets\nwere gathered from publicly accessible web con-\ntent by October 2022, and there are no licensing\nissues associated with them. They do not contain\nany user-specific private information. In particular,\n• Pokémon is a video game centered around fic-\ntional creatures called \"Pocket Monsters\" that\ntrainers capture and train to battle each other.\nPokémon is owned by Nintendo Co., Ltd., Crea-\ntures Inc., and Game Freak Inc.\nPokémon\ndata is collected from https:\/\/bulbapedia.\nbulbagarden.net\/wiki under the “CC BY-NC-\nSA 2.5” license.\n• HearthStone is an online collectible card game\ndeveloped by Blizzard Entertainment, Inc., featur-\ning strategic gameplay where players build decks\nand compete against each other using a variety of\nspells, minions, and abilities. Hearthstone data\nis collected from https:\/\/hearthstonejson.\ncom\/ under the “CC0” license.\n• League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online\nbattle arena (MOBA) video game developed by\nRiot Games, Inc. where teams of players compete\nin fast-paced matches, utilizing unique champi-\nons with distinct abilities to achieve victory. LoL\ndata is collected from https:\/\/lolskinshop.\ncom\/product-category\/lol-skins\/.\n• Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is\na multiplayer first-person shooter video game\ndeveloped by Valve Corporation and Hidden\nPath Entertainment, Inc., where players join\nteams to compete in objective-based matches\ninvolving tactical gameplay and precise shoot-\ning. CS:GO data is collected from https:\/\/www.\ncsgodatabase.com\/.\n2CC BY-NC-SA 4.0: https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/\nlicenses\/by-nc-sa\/4.0\/\n3.2\nCreation Process\nTo create MUG, we first identify the categorical\ncolumns that can serve as the prediction targets.\nThe reasons for choosing these targets are elabo-\nrated in Appendix B.1. We obtain a total of eight\ndatasets from the four games, including pkm_t1\nand pkm_t2 from Pokémon; hs_ac, hs_as, hs_mr,\nand hs_ss; lol_sc from LoL; csg_sq from CS:GO.\nThen, we conduct necessary data cleaning and\nverification to ensure the quality of MUG. To allevi-\nate the class imbalance issue in some datasets (e.g.,\none class may contain less than 10 samples), we\nre-group sparse classes into one new class that con-\ntains enough samples for training and evaluation.\nFor missing values of target categorical columns,\nwe manually assign a special None_Type as one\nnew class of the dataset. For missing values of\ninput columns, we keep them blank to allow classi-\nfication models to decide the best imputation strate-\ngies. Moreover, we also anonymize columns that\ncause data leakage (e.g., the id column in hs_as is\ntransformed to anonymous_id column).\nAfter the abovementioned preprocessing, we\nsplit the dataset into training, validation, and test-\ning sets with an 80\/5\/15 ratio. Each dataset com-\npromises between 1K and 10K samples, associ-\nated with tabular, textual, and visual features. An\noverview of these datasets is shown in Table 1.\nThis broad range of sample sizes and diverse data\ntypes ensures the representation of a wide variety\nof instances, allowing for robust model training and\nevaluation across different data modalities.\n3.3\nBenchmark Analysis\nThe MUG benchmark is curated to meet the fol-\nlowing list of criteria:\n(i) Publicly available data and baseline models can\nfacilitate reproducible experiments and accelerate\nthe development of advanced models.\n(ii) Diversity should be preserved in the bench-\nmark. We do not want the benchmark to have a\nbias toward certain data or class distribution. The\nbenchmark with a high variety of datasets aids the\nresearch community in examining the robustness\nof models.\n(iii) Multimodal-dependent classification is ex-\npected for each dataset. Datasets that are too easy\nto be classified by a single modality are not suit-\nable, since they would hide the gap between the\nmultimodal perceptron abilities of models.\nWe conduct a rich set of analyses to verify\nDataset\nGame\nPred.

Figure 2 shows the properties of datasets\nin multi-aspect. For the classification task proper-\nties(Figure 2a), we adopt the Shannon equitability\nindex (Shannon, 1948) (definition in Appendix B.2)\nto measure the class balance ratio.\nThe index\nranges from 0 to 1, and the larger the Shannon\nequitability index, the more balanced the dataset is.\nFor the feature properties, we include percentages\nof missing features (Figure 2b), means and stan-\ndard deviations of numerical features (Figure 2c),\ncategory counts of categorical features (Figure 2d),\ndistributions of word counts per sample (Figure 2e),\nand distributions of image mean RGB pixel values\n(Figure 2f). In these figures, we merged dupli-\ncated results from some datasets into one group to\nmake the presentation clean and neat (i.e., pkm_t1,\npkm_t2 are grouped into pkm; hs_ac, hs_as, hs_mr,\nhs_ss are grouped into hs). As shown in the fig-\nures, the eight datasets reflect real-world problems\nthat are diverse and challenging. We further study\nthe correlation between category labels and input\nmodalities in MUG. Referring to the t-SNE pro-\njection of multimodal embeddings in Figure 7, it\nis evident that MUG exhibits a strong multimodal\ndependency. In this case, the use of unimodal in-\nformation alone is inadequate to differentiate be-\ntween samples belonging to different classes. For\na more comprehensive analysis, we encourage in-\nterested readers to refer to the details provided in\nAppendix B.3\n4\nBaseline Models\nWe employ several state-of-the-art unimodal classi-\nfiers and multimodal classifiers in the experiments.\nWe also proposed our own graph neural network-\nbased multimodal classifier as one baseline model\nto be compared.\n4.1\nExisting State-Of-The-Art Classifiers\nIn this paper, we adopt the following SOTA uni-\nmodal classifiers in the experiments:\nTabular modality classifiers:\n• GBM (Ke et al., 2017) is a light gradient boosting\nframework based on decision trees. Due to its\nability to capture nonlinear relationships, handle\ncomplex tabular data, provide feature importance\ninsights, and robustness to outliers and missing\nvalues, GBM has achieved state-of-the-art results\nin various tabular data tasks,\n• tabMLP (Erickson et al., 2020) is a multilayer\nperceptron (MLP) model that is specifically de-\nsigned to work with tabular data. tabMLP con-\ntains multiple separate embedding layers to han-\ndle categorical and numerical input features.\nTextual modality classifiers:\n• RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) is a robustly\noptimized transformer-based masked language\nmodel (masked LM). RoBERTa builds upon the\nsuccess of BERT by refining and optimizing its\ntraining methodology, and achieves superior per-\nformance on a wide range of NLP tasks.\n• Electra (Clark et al., 2020) is another variant of\nthe transformer-based model, which differs from\ntraditional masked LMs like BERT or RoBERTa.\nWhile masked LMs randomly mask tokens and\npredict these masked tokens, Electra is trained as\na discriminator to identify whether each token is\nreplaced by a generator.\nVisual modality classifiers:\n• ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) extends the trans-\nformer model to image data, by dividing the input\nimage into a grid of patches and processing each\npatch as a token. Empirical results show that ViT\noutperforms previous SOTA convolutional neural\nnetworks in image classification tasks.\n• SWIN (Liu et al., 2021) is another vision trans-\nformer that benefits from hierarchical architec-\nture and the shifted windowing scheme. The pro-\nposed techniques address several key challenges\nwhen adapting transformers in image modality,\nsuch as large variations in the scale of visual\nentities and the high resolution of pixels.\nIn practice, we adopt the following multimodal\nclassifiers in the experiments:\n• AutoGluon (Erickson et al., 2022) is an\nensemble-learning model for multimodal clas-\nsification and regression tasks. The concept of\nAutoGluon is stack ensembling, where the final\nprediction is obtained by combining intermediate\npredictions from multiple base models. To han-\ndle multimodal classification, SOTA unimodal\nclassifiers (e.g., tree models, MLPs, CNNs, trans-\nformers) are adopted as base models.\n• AutoMM (Shi et al., 2021) is a late-fusion model\nwhere separate neural operations are conducted\non each data type and extracted high-level repre-\nsentations are aggregated near the output layer.\nSpecifically, MLPs are used for tabular modal-\nity, and transformers are used for text and image\nmodalities. After that, dense vector embeddings\nfrom the last layer of each network are pooled\ninto one vector, and the final prediction is ob-\ntained via an additional two-layer MLP.\n4.2\nMUGNET\nMUGNET is our own multimodal classifier which\nis further proposed as a competitor to existing mod-\nels. We propose three key components to make\nMUGNET a powerful graph neural network for\nthe multimodal classification task. They are adap-\ntive multiplex graph construction module, GAT en-\ncoder module, and attention-based fusion module,\nas shown in Figure 3. Firstly, adaptive multiplex\ngraphs are constructed to reflect sample-wise simi-\nlarity within each modality. Then, separate GAT en-\ncoders (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018) are employed to ob-\ntain dense embeddings of samples, by propagating\ninformation between neighbors. Finally, tabular,\ntext and image embeddings are combined by inter-\nmodality attention to obtaining the fused embed-\nding for multimodal classification. GNNs (Yang\net al., 2020; Guo et al., 2021) show great capability\nto leverage the graph structure, propagate informa-\ntion, integrate features, and capture higher-order\nrelationships. This leads to accurate and robust\nclassification performance across various domains.\nsamples\nTabular\nText\nImage\nsamples\nsamples\nGATtab\nGATtxt\nGATimg\nTab. embs\nFused embs.\nMUGNET\nAdaptive Multiplex\nGraph Construction\nsamples\nInter-modality \nAttention\nTxt. embs\nImg. embs\nFigure 3: Model architecture of MUGNET.\nIn this work, we propose to regard the whole sam-\nples as a correlation network (Wang et al., 2021;\nGeorgantas and Richiardi, 2022) that represents\nsample-to-sample similarities, while existing mul-\ntimodal classifiers rarely consider this before.\nAdaptive multiplex graph construction module.\nFollowing the notation defined in §5.1, the adaptive\nmultiplex graph construction module first utilizes\npre-processing pipelines (e.g., monotonically in-\ncreasing integer mapping for categorical inputs, no\nalteration for numerical inputs) or pre-trained fea-\nture extractors (e.g., CLIP (Radford et al., 2021)\nfor text and image inputs) to obtain dense mul-\ntimodal features F = f(XL) ∈RN×(dt+ds+di),\nwhere F = {Ft, Fs, Fi} denotes feature matri-\nces for tabular, text, and image modalities. The\nadaptive multiplex graph construction module then\nderives multiplex sample-wise similarity graph\nG = {Gt, Gs, Gi} = {(At, Ft),\n(As, Fs), (Ai, Fi)}, where each modality-specific\nadjacency matrix Am ∈RN×N, ∀m ∈{t, s, i} is\ncalculated based on the multimodal features\nAm\ni,j = sim(Fm\ni , Fm\nj ).\n(1)\nIt is worth noting that the sample-wise similarity\nfunction sim is adaptive, and is chosen from co-\nsine similarity, radial basis function (RBF) ker-\nnel, or k-nearest neighbor. For these modality-\nspecific graphs, we use separate hyperparameters\n(e.g., threshold for score-based functions, or the\nvalue of k for k-nearest neighbor) to control their\nsparsity properties. The similarity function and its\nassociated hyperparameters are determined through\nhyperparameter tuning (Liaw et al., 2018) on the\nheld-out validation set, so that the multiplex graph\nconstruction is adaptive to any downstream task.\nGAT encoder module.\nWe use the power-\nful multi-head graph attention neural network\n(GAT) (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018) as the encoder to\nobtain structure-aware representations of samples.\nSeparate GATs are employed for each view of the\nmultiple graph, so that Hm = GAT(Am, Fm; θ),\nwhere Hm ∈RN×dm\nh , and θ represents the learn-\nable parameters of the GAT encoder. We want to\nstate there is no information leakage in MUGNET,\nbecause we follow the inductive learning setting\nof GNNs (Hamilton et al., 2017) where the GAT\nencoder is trained on the multiplex graph G de-\nrived from labeled training samples XL, and new\nunseen multiplex graph is derived from all sam-\nples XL ∪XU at the inference stage.\nFurther-\nmore, we adopt a graph sampling technique (Graph-\nSAINT (Zeng et al., 2019)) during the GAT train-\ning process, to improve the efficiency and general-\nization. The graph sampling technique essentially\nsamples a subgraph by random walks for each train-\ning step, thus the “neighbor explosion” issue is al-\nleviated with a constrained number of neighbors\nper node and the variance of GAT is reduced with\nfewer outliers or noise in the sampled graph.\nAttention-based fusion module. After we obtain\nthe structure-aware embeddings of samples from\nthe tabular, text, and image modalities Ht, Hs, Hi,\nthe attention-based fusion module is responsible\nfor fusing them into one single embedding via\nthe attention-based fusion module. The attention\nweight αm\nj ∈R for j-th sample of modality m is\ncomputed as:\nαm\nj =\nexp(em\nj )\nP\nm′∈{t,s,j} exp(em′\nj ),\n(2)\nem\nj = wa2 · tanh(W m\na1hm\nj ),\n(3)\nwhere em\nj ∈R denotes the unnormalized attention\nweight, wa2 ∈Rdm\na ×1, Wa1 ∈Rdm\nh ×dm\na denote\nlearnable parameters, and hm\nj ∈Rdm\nh denotes the\nj-th row of Hm (i.e., embedding of j-th sample of\nmodality m). The fused embedding of j-th sample\nis then calculated by:\nhj = αt\njht\nj + αs\njhs\nj + αi\njhi\ni.\n(4)\nThe fused embedding hj incorporates cross-\nmodalities interactions and provides a complete\ncontext for the downstream tasks.\nAn addi-\ntional two-layer MLP is trained to predict the\ncategory of j-th sample ˆyj = softmax(Wcls2 ·\nLeakyReLU(Wcls1hj)). We adopt cross-entropy\nbetween prediction ˆy and target y as MUGNET’s\nloss function.\n5\nExperiments\n5.1\nProblem Definition\nGiven a finite set of categories Y and labeled train-\ning pairs (xi, yi) ∈XL × Y, multimodal classifica-\ntion aims at finding a classifier ˆf : XL →Y such\nthat ˆyj = ˆf(xj) is a good approxmiation of the\nunknown label yj for unseen sample xj ∈XU. It\nis worth noting that the each multimodal sample\nx ∈XL ∪XU consists of tabular fields t, textual\nfields s, and image fields i (i.e., x = {t, s, i}).\n5.2\nExperimental Setup\nWe use the official training, validation, and testing\nsplits provided by MUG to conduct experiments.\nWe choose the log-loss and accuracy to evaluate\nmodel performance, since these metrics are rea-\nsonable and commonly used in previous studies.\nFor comparable and reproducible results, all mod-\nels are trained and tested using the same hardware.\nSpecifically, the machine is equipped with 16 Intel\nXeon Gold 6254 CPUs (18 cores per CPU) and one\n24GB TITAN RTX GPU. We add an 8-hour time\nlimitation for the training process to reflect real-\nworld resource constraints. The implementation\nand hyperparameter details of evaluated models are\nput in Appendix C.\n5.3\nPerformance Comparisons\nTable 2a and 2b show the performance of all eval-\nuated models on MUG. As can be seen, multi-\nmodal classifiers (except AutoMM) consistently\noutperform unimodal classifiers in both log-loss\nand accuracy.\nIt demonstrates that the classifi-\ncation tasks in MUG are multimodal-dependent\nwhere each modality only conveys partial informa-\ntion about the required outputs. Among the three\nmultimodal classifiers we used, AutoGluon and\nMUGNET are the top-2 models with well-matched\nperformances. In Table 2a and 2b, AutoGluon\nachieves the best performance eight times, while\nMUGNET also achieves the best performance eight\ntimes. More specifically, AutoGluon is superior in\nlog-loss whereas MUGNET has better accuracy\nscores. AutoMM performs the worst among multi-\nmodal classifiers, and it sometimes underperforms\nunimodal classifiers. Considering that AutoMM\ntrains powerful deep neural networks on a small\nscale of datasets and we have observed the gap\nbetween the training loss and validation loss, it is\nhighly possible that AutoMM is overfitting. While\nAutoGluon and MUGNET also adopt deep neu-\nral networks as base models, they are more robust\nsince AutoGluon proposes a repeated bagging strat-\negy and MUGNET utilizes graph sampling tech-\nniques to avoid overfitting. Among unimodal clas-\nsifiers, tabular models seem to outperform textual\nand visual models in most cases (six out of eight\ndatasets). There is a slight performance gain com-\nparing textual models to visual models because\ntextual models are better on five datasets.\nTo better understand the overall performance of\nmodels across multiple datasets, we propose using\ncritical difference (CD) diagrams (Demšar, 2006).\nIn a CD diagram, the average rank of each model\nand which ranks are statistically significantly dif-\nferent from each other are shown. Figure 4a and\n4b show the CD diagrams using the Friedman test\nwith Nemenyi post-hoc test at p < 0.05. In sum-\nmary, we observe that AutoGluon and MUGNET\nrespectively achieve the best rank among all tested\nmodels with respect to log-loss and accuracy, al-\nthough never by a statistically significant margin.\nMoreover, tabular models obtain higher ranks than\nother unimodal classifiers. The similar observa-\ntions from Table 2 and Figure 4 support that effec-\ntively aggregating information across modalities is\ncritical for the multimodal classification task.\nMethod\npkm_t1\npkm_t2\nhs_ac\nhs_as\nhs_mr\nhs_ss\nlol_sc\ncsg_sq\nUnimodal Classifiers\nGBM\n1.838\n2.038\n0.911\n2.352\n0.913\n0.603\n0.198\n1.107\ntabMLP\n1.442\n1.909\n1.172\n2.155\n1.247\n0.672\n0.533\n0.718\nRoBERTa\n1.834\n2.191\n1.999\n2.393\n1.920\n1.254\n0.847\n0.734\nElectra\n2.907\n2.179\n2.118\n3.155\n2.085\n1.263\n0.611\n0.757\nViT\n3.680\n2.543\n1.527\n2.786\n1.032\n2.056\n2.049\n0.835\nSwin\n2.657\n2.229\n2.018\n2.795\n2.089\n1.397\n1.470\n0.750\nMultimodal Classifiers\nAutoGluon\n0.973\n1.507\n0.654\n1.793\n0.403\n0.350\n0.159\n0.631\nAutoMM\n1.736\n2.029\n1.987\n2.193\n1.836\n1.320\n0.792\n0.674\nMUGNET\n1.000\n1.499\n0.922\n1.499\n0.321\n0.442\n0.248\n0.654\n(a) Results in ‘log-loss’ (the less the better).\nMethod\npkm_t1\npkm_t2\nhs_ac\nhs_as\nhs_mr\nhs_ss\nlol_sc\ncsg_sq\nUnimodal Classifiers\nGBM\n0.489\n0.489\n0.726\n0.421\n0.737\n0.795\n0.963\n0.610\ntabMLP\n0.662\n0.481\n0.627\n0.377\n0.617\n0.776\n0.851\n0.681\nRoberta\n0.662\n0.466\n0.475\n0.366\n0.535\n0.683\n0.883\n0.688\nElectra\n0.120\n0.466\n0.475\n0.168\n0.535\n0.683\n0.878\n0.702\nViT\n0.308\n0.406\n0.568\n0.236\n0.787\n0.593\n0.436\n0.674\nSwin\n0.346\n0.451\n0.470\n0.248\n0.536\n0.657\n0.431\n0.702\nMultimodal Classifiers\nAutoGluon\n0.744\n0.617\n0.787\n0.495\n0.879\n0.882\n0.963\n0.766\nAutoMM\n0.639\n0.511\n0.475\n0.415\n0.549\n0.671\n0.888\n0.738\nMUGNET\n0.774\n0.669\n0.724\n0.572\n0.908\n0.880\n0.968\n0.745\n(b) Result in ‘accuracy’ (the more the better).\nTable 2: Overall experimental results with explicit modality performance.

Trade-off\noften exists between how accurate the model is\nGBM\ntabMLP\nRoBERTa\nElectra\nViT\nSwin\nAutoGluon\nAutoMM\nMUGNET\n101\n102\n103\n104\nTraining Duration (seconds)\nFigure 5: Training duration on all datasets.\nand how long it takes to train and infer the model.\nTherefore, we record the training durations and test\ndurations of models to examine their efficiency. In\nFigure 5, we show the aggregated training dura-\ntion of evaluated models via a box plot. As can\nbe seen, tabular models require an order of magni-\ntude less training duration than the other models,\nwhile AutoGluon stands out as requiring signif-\nicantly longer training duration. Among tabular\nmodels, tabMLP is 4x faster than GBM in terms\nof the median training duration. Except for tabular\nmodels and AutoGluon, other models are approxi-\nmately lightweight to train. It is worth noting that\nAutoGluon hits the 8-hour training duration con-\nstraint on every dataset, thus the variance of its\ntraining durations across datasets is very small.\nIn Figure 6, we show the trade-offs between\nmean inference time and mean accuracy of models.\nSince the accuracy is not commensurable across\ndatasets, we first normalize all accuracies through\na dataset-wise min-max normalization. After the\nnormalization, the best model in each dataset is\nscaled to 1 while the worst model is scaled to 0.\nFinally, we take the average on the normalized ac-\ncuracies and the test durations to draw the scatter\nplot. When both accuracy and efficiency are objec-\ntives models try to improve, there does not exist a\nmodel that achieves the best in both objectives si-\nmultaneously. As an illustration, MUGNET has the\nhighest test accuracy, but tabMLP has the fastest\ninference speed. Therefore, we adopt the Pareto-\noptimal3 concept to identify which models achieve\n“optimal” trade-offs. Pareto-optimal is widely used\nin the decision-making process for multi-objective\noptimization scenarios. By definition, a solution\nis Pareto-optimal if any of the objectives cannot\n3Pareto-optimal Definition: https:\/\/w.wiki\/6sLB\nbe improved without degrading at least one of the\nother objectives. Following this concept, we ob-\nserve that tabMLP, GBM, and MUGNET are the\nmodels with the best trade-offs between accuracy\nand efficiency, as these models reside in the Pareto\nfrontier in Figure 6. Meanwhile, other models are\nsuboptimal with regard to this trade-off, since we\ncan always find a solution that has higher accu-\nracy and better efficiency simultaneously than these\nmodels.\n10−2\n10−1\n100\n101\n102\n103\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nGBM\ntabMLP\nRoBERTa\nElectra\nViT\nSwin\nAutoGluon\nAutoMM\nMUGNET\nTest Duration (seconds)\nTest Accuracy\nFigure 6: Mean testing duration and mean normalized\naccuracy tradeoffs on all datasets.\n6\nConclusion\nThis paper presents a benchmark dataset MUGNET\nalong with multiple baselines as a starting point for\nthe machine learning community to improve upon.\nMUGNET is a multimodal classification bench-\nmark on game data that covers tabular, textual, and\nvisual modalities. All eight datasets and nine evalu-\nated baselines are open-source and easily-extended\nto motivate rapid iteration and reproducible ex-\nperiments for researchers. A comprehensive set\nof analyses is included to provide insight into the\ncharacteristics of the benchmark. The experimen-\ntal results reported in the paper are obtained from\nmodels trained with constrained resources, which\nis often required by real-life applications. However,\nwe also welcome future works that utilize enor-\nmous resources. Finally, we hope this work can\nfacilitate research on multimodal learning, and we\nencourage any extensions to MUGNET to support\nnew tasks or applications such as open-domain re-\ntrieval, AI-generated content, multimodal QA, etc.\nLimitations\nWhile our study emphasizes the importance of effi-\nciency in real-world machine learning applications,\nwe acknowledge certain limitations in our approach.\nSpecifically, we deliberately focused on training\nand evaluating relatively \"small\" models within the\ncontext of the current era of large vision and lan-\nguage models (LVLMs) (Li et al., 2023; Liu et al.,\n2023; Lu et al., 2023). As a result, the performance\nof LVLMs on our proposed MUG benchmark re-\nmains unexplored. Early exploration (Hegselmann\net al., 2023) about applying large language models\non tabular classification shows that LLMs can be\ncompetitive with strong tree-based models. Based\non the explorations and conducted experiments, we\nspeculate LLVMs can not beat efficient ensemble\nor GNN baselines using the same training time\nconstraint. However, to provide a comprehensive\nunderstanding of multimodal classification, further\nresearch is expected. It would be also intriguing to\ninvestigate the performance of LLVMs when pro-\nvided with unlimited training (fine-tuning) time.\nAcknowledgement\nThis research is partly supported by the National\nInstitute Of Diabetes And Digestive And Kidney\nDiseases of the National Institutes of Health under\nAward Number K25DK135913 and the Division\nof Mathematical Sciences of the National Science\nFoundation under Award Number 2208412.

Real-\nworld data is often stored in well-structured\ndatabases that contain tabular fields, with textual\nand visual fields co-occurring. Numerous auto-\nmated classification systems have been deployed\non these multimodal data to provide efficient and\nscalable services. For instance, medical decision\nsupport systems (Soenksen et al., 2022) utilize pa-\ntients’ electronic health record data that contains\ntabular inputs (e.g., ages, genders, races), textual\ninputs (e.g., notes, prescriptions, written reports),\nand visual inputs (e.g., x-rays, magnetic resonance\nimaging, ct-scans) to help precise disease predic-\ntion. Similarly, e-commerce product classification\nsystems (Erickson et al., 2022) categorize prod-\nucts based on their categorical\/numerical quanti-\n*These authors contributed equally to this work\nname: Clawfury Adept\ntext: Give all other friendly \ncharacters +1 attack this turn\nattack: 2\nhealth: 3\ncost: 2\nrarity: Common\ntype: Minion\ncardClass =?

Therefore, accurate classification\nmodels for table-text-image input are desired.\nDeep neural networks have shown significant\nprogress in multimodal learning tasks, such as\nCLIP (Radford et al., 2021) for image-text re-\ntrieval and Fuse-Transformer (Shi et al., 2021)\nfor tabular-with-text classification. This progress\nhas been made with large-scale datasets provided\nto train the data-eager models. So far, there ex-\nist many datasets (Ovalle et al., 2017; Wu et al.,\n2021; Shi et al., 2021; Qu et al., 2022; Lin et al.,\n2020; Lee et al., 2019; Kautzky et al., 2020; Srini-\nvasan et al., 2021) that cover one or two modali-\nties. However, the progress in tabular-text-image\nmultimodal learning lags due to the lack of avail-\nable resources. In this paper, we provide a mul-\ntimodal benchmark, namely MUG, that contains\neight datasets for researchers to examine their al-\narXiv:2302.02978v2  [cs.LG]  17 Oct 2023\ngorithms’ multimodal perception ability. MUG\ncontains data samples with tabular, textual, and vi-\nsual fields that are collected from various genres of\ngames. We have made necessary cleaning, transfor-\nmations, and modifications to the original data to\nmake MUG easy to use. We further conduct com-\nprehensive data analysis to demonstrate the diverse\nand multimodal-dependent properties of MUG.\nMUG can enable future studies of many mul-\ntimodal tasks, and we focus on the multimodal\nclassification task in this paper. For the primary\nclassification evaluation, we incorporate two state-\nof-the-art (SOTA) unimodal classifiers for each of\nthe three input modalities, resulting in a total of\nsix, along with two SOTA multimodal classifiers.\nWe also propose a novel baseline model MUGNET\nbased on the graph attention network (Veliˇckovi´c\net al., 2018).\nIn addition to capturing the in-\nteractions among the three input modalities, our\nMUGNET takes the sample-wise similarity into\naccount, yielding a compatible performance to ex-\nisting multimodal classifiers. We further conduct\nefficiency evaluations to reflect the practical re-\nquirements of many machine learning systems.\n2\nRelated Works\n2.1\nMultimodal Classification Datasets with\nTabular, Textual, and Visual Fields\nMachine learning models in real-world applications\nneed to deal with multimodal data that contains\nboth tabular, textual, and visual fields. Due to pri-\nvacy or license issues, there exist very few datasets\nthat cover these three modalities. To the best of our\nknowledge, PetFinder1 is one of the few publicly\navailable datasets. HAIM-MIMIC-MM (Soenksen\net al., 2022) is a multimodal healthcare dataset\ncontaining tabular, textual, image, and time-series\nfields. However, only credentialed users can access\nHAIM-MIMIC-MM. On the other hand, there exist\nmany datasets that cover two modalities (out of\ntable, text, and image modalities). The most com-\nmon datasets are the ones with both textual and\nvisual features (MM-IMDB (Ovalle et al., 2017),\nV-SNLI (Vu et al., 2018), MultiOFF (Suryawan-\nshi et al., 2020), WIT (Srinivasan et al., 2021),\nMELINDA (Wu et al., 2021), etc.). Meanwhile,\n(Shi et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2019; Qu et al., 2022)\nprovide benchmark datasets for table and text\nmodalities, For the combination of table and image\n1PetFinder: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/competitions\/\npetfinder-adoption-prediction\/overview\nmodalities, there are a bunch of datasets from the\nmedical domain (Lin et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2019;\nKautzky et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2020). Other\nthan the mentioned table, text, and image modali-\nties, multimodal learning has also been conducted\nin time-series, speech, and video modalities (Zhang\net al., 2022, 2020; Li et al., 2020).\n2.2\nMultimodal Classifiers for Tabular,\nTextual, and Visual Fields\nFusion is the core technology for multimodal classi-\nfication problems, which integrates data from each\ninput modality and utilizes fused representations\nfor downstream tasks (classification, regression,\nretrieval, etc.). Based on the stage of fusion (Iv\net al., 2021), existing methods can be divided into\nearly, late, or hybrid fusion. Early fusion mod-\nels (Sun et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2021; Zhu et al.,\n2021) usually fuse raw data or extracted features\nbefore they are fed into the learnable classifier,\nwhile late fusion models (Erickson et al., 2020;\nSoenksen et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2022) employ sep-\narate learnable encoders for all input modalities\nand then fuse these learned representations into\nthe learnable classifier. Hybrid fusion models are\nmore flexible, allowing for modality fusion to oc-\ncur at different stages simultaneously (Qingyun\net al., 2021; Li et al., 2021). Although existing\nworks have demonstrated remarkable capability\nin modeling feature interactions, they ignore sig-\nnals of sample proximity, such as the tendency for\nwithin a group to exhibit similar behavior or share\ncommon interests. In response, we propose our ap-\nproach, MUGNET, which dynamically constructs\ngraphs based on sample similarity and effectively\ncombines graphical representation learning with\nmultimodal fusion. Our approach draws inspira-\ntion from pioneering graph neural networks (Guo\net al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021; Georgantas and\nRichiardi, 2022), which have achieved success in\nvarious classification tasks.\n3\nMUG: the benchmark\nWe create and release MUG with eight datasets\nfor multimodal classification with tabular, text, and\nimage fields to the community for future studies.\nRaw data and examples of how to appropriately\nload the data are provided in https:\/\/github.\ncom\/lujiaying\/MUG-Bench. MUG is under the\n\"CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\" license2, and is designated to\nuse for research purposes.\n3.1\nData Sources\nTo collect multiple and large-scale datasets that\nsupport multimodal automated machine learning,\nwe collected data from four games: Pokémon,\nHearthstone, League of Legends, and Counter-\nStrike: Global Offensive. We deliberately chose\nthese video games as they have distinct video game\ngenres (e.g., role-playing, card, multiplayer online\nbattle arena, and shooting). All of these datasets\nwere gathered from publicly accessible web con-\ntent by October 2022, and there are no licensing\nissues associated with them. They do not contain\nany user-specific private information. In particular,\n• Pokémon is a video game centered around fic-\ntional creatures called \"Pocket Monsters\" that\ntrainers capture and train to battle each other.\nPokémon is owned by Nintendo Co., Ltd., Crea-\ntures Inc., and Game Freak Inc.\nPokémon\ndata is collected from https:\/\/bulbapedia.\nbulbagarden.net\/wiki under the “CC BY-NC-\nSA 2.5” license.\n• HearthStone is an online collectible card game\ndeveloped by Blizzard Entertainment, Inc., featur-\ning strategic gameplay where players build decks\nand compete against each other using a variety of\nspells, minions, and abilities. Hearthstone data\nis collected from https:\/\/hearthstonejson.\ncom\/ under the “CC0” license.\n• League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online\nbattle arena (MOBA) video game developed by\nRiot Games, Inc. where teams of players compete\nin fast-paced matches, utilizing unique champi-\nons with distinct abilities to achieve victory. LoL\ndata is collected from https:\/\/lolskinshop.\ncom\/product-category\/lol-skins\/.\n• Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is\na multiplayer first-person shooter video game\ndeveloped by Valve Corporation and Hidden\nPath Entertainment, Inc., where players join\nteams to compete in objective-based matches\ninvolving tactical gameplay and precise shoot-\ning. CS:GO data is collected from https:\/\/www.\ncsgodatabase.com\/.\n2CC BY-NC-SA 4.0: https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/\nlicenses\/by-nc-sa\/4.0\/\n3.2\nCreation Process\nTo create MUG, we first identify the categorical\ncolumns that can serve as the prediction targets.\nThe reasons for choosing these targets are elabo-\nrated in Appendix B.1. We obtain a total of eight\ndatasets from the four games, including pkm_t1\nand pkm_t2 from Pokémon; hs_ac, hs_as, hs_mr,\nand hs_ss; lol_sc from LoL; csg_sq from CS:GO.\nThen, we conduct necessary data cleaning and\nverification to ensure the quality of MUG. To allevi-\nate the class imbalance issue in some datasets (e.g.,\none class may contain less than 10 samples), we\nre-group sparse classes into one new class that con-\ntains enough samples for training and evaluation.\nFor missing values of target categorical columns,\nwe manually assign a special None_Type as one\nnew class of the dataset. For missing values of\ninput columns, we keep them blank to allow classi-\nfication models to decide the best imputation strate-\ngies. Moreover, we also anonymize columns that\ncause data leakage (e.g., the id column in hs_as is\ntransformed to anonymous_id column).\nAfter the abovementioned preprocessing, we\nsplit the dataset into training, validation, and test-\ning sets with an 80\/5\/15 ratio. Each dataset com-\npromises between 1K and 10K samples, associ-\nated with tabular, textual, and visual features. An\noverview of these datasets is shown in Table 1.\nThis broad range of sample sizes and diverse data\ntypes ensures the representation of a wide variety\nof instances, allowing for robust model training and\nevaluation across different data modalities.\n3.3\nBenchmark Analysis\nThe MUG benchmark is curated to meet the fol-\nlowing list of criteria:\n(i) Publicly available data and baseline models can\nfacilitate reproducible experiments and accelerate\nthe development of advanced models.\n(ii) Diversity should be preserved in the bench-\nmark. We do not want the benchmark to have a\nbias toward certain data or class distribution. The\nbenchmark with a high variety of datasets aids the\nresearch community in examining the robustness\nof models.\n(iii) Multimodal-dependent classification is ex-\npected for each dataset. Datasets that are too easy\nto be classified by a single modality are not suit-\nable, since they would hide the gap between the\nmultimodal perceptron abilities of models.\nWe conduct a rich set of analyses to verify\nDataset\nGame\nPred.

Figure 2 shows the properties of datasets\nin multi-aspect. For the classification task proper-\nties(Figure 2a), we adopt the Shannon equitability\nindex (Shannon, 1948) (definition in Appendix B.2)\nto measure the class balance ratio.\nThe index\nranges from 0 to 1, and the larger the Shannon\nequitability index, the more balanced the dataset is.\nFor the feature properties, we include percentages\nof missing features (Figure 2b), means and stan-\ndard deviations of numerical features (Figure 2c),\ncategory counts of categorical features (Figure 2d),\ndistributions of word counts per sample (Figure 2e),\nand distributions of image mean RGB pixel values\n(Figure 2f). In these figures, we merged dupli-\ncated results from some datasets into one group to\nmake the presentation clean and neat (i.e., pkm_t1,\npkm_t2 are grouped into pkm; hs_ac, hs_as, hs_mr,\nhs_ss are grouped into hs). As shown in the fig-\nures, the eight datasets reflect real-world problems\nthat are diverse and challenging. We further study\nthe correlation between category labels and input\nmodalities in MUG. Referring to the t-SNE pro-\njection of multimodal embeddings in Figure 7, it\nis evident that MUG exhibits a strong multimodal\ndependency. In this case, the use of unimodal in-\nformation alone is inadequate to differentiate be-\ntween samples belonging to different classes. For\na more comprehensive analysis, we encourage in-\nterested readers to refer to the details provided in\nAppendix B.3\n4\nBaseline Models\nWe employ several state-of-the-art unimodal classi-\nfiers and multimodal classifiers in the experiments.\nWe also proposed our own graph neural network-\nbased multimodal classifier as one baseline model\nto be compared.\n4.1\nExisting State-Of-The-Art Classifiers\nIn this paper, we adopt the following SOTA uni-\nmodal classifiers in the experiments:\nTabular modality classifiers:\n• GBM (Ke et al., 2017) is a light gradient boosting\nframework based on decision trees. Due to its\nability to capture nonlinear relationships, handle\ncomplex tabular data, provide feature importance\ninsights, and robustness to outliers and missing\nvalues, GBM has achieved state-of-the-art results\nin various tabular data tasks,\n• tabMLP (Erickson et al., 2020) is a multilayer\nperceptron (MLP) model that is specifically de-\nsigned to work with tabular data. tabMLP con-\ntains multiple separate embedding layers to han-\ndle categorical and numerical input features.\nTextual modality classifiers:\n• RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) is a robustly\noptimized transformer-based masked language\nmodel (masked LM). RoBERTa builds upon the\nsuccess of BERT by refining and optimizing its\ntraining methodology, and achieves superior per-\nformance on a wide range of NLP tasks.\n• Electra (Clark et al., 2020) is another variant of\nthe transformer-based model, which differs from\ntraditional masked LMs like BERT or RoBERTa.\nWhile masked LMs randomly mask tokens and\npredict these masked tokens, Electra is trained as\na discriminator to identify whether each token is\nreplaced by a generator.\nVisual modality classifiers:\n• ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) extends the trans-\nformer model to image data, by dividing the input\nimage into a grid of patches and processing each\npatch as a token. Empirical results show that ViT\noutperforms previous SOTA convolutional neural\nnetworks in image classification tasks.\n• SWIN (Liu et al., 2021) is another vision trans-\nformer that benefits from hierarchical architec-\nture and the shifted windowing scheme. The pro-\nposed techniques address several key challenges\nwhen adapting transformers in image modality,\nsuch as large variations in the scale of visual\nentities and the high resolution of pixels.\nIn practice, we adopt the following multimodal\nclassifiers in the experiments:\n• AutoGluon (Erickson et al., 2022) is an\nensemble-learning model for multimodal clas-\nsification and regression tasks. The concept of\nAutoGluon is stack ensembling, where the final\nprediction is obtained by combining intermediate\npredictions from multiple base models. To han-\ndle multimodal classification, SOTA unimodal\nclassifiers (e.g., tree models, MLPs, CNNs, trans-\nformers) are adopted as base models.\n• AutoMM (Shi et al., 2021) is a late-fusion model\nwhere separate neural operations are conducted\non each data type and extracted high-level repre-\nsentations are aggregated near the output layer.\nSpecifically, MLPs are used for tabular modal-\nity, and transformers are used for text and image\nmodalities. After that, dense vector embeddings\nfrom the last layer of each network are pooled\ninto one vector, and the final prediction is ob-\ntained via an additional two-layer MLP.\n4.2\nMUGNET\nMUGNET is our own multimodal classifier which\nis further proposed as a competitor to existing mod-\nels. We propose three key components to make\nMUGNET a powerful graph neural network for\nthe multimodal classification task. They are adap-\ntive multiplex graph construction module, GAT en-\ncoder module, and attention-based fusion module,\nas shown in Figure 3. Firstly, adaptive multiplex\ngraphs are constructed to reflect sample-wise simi-\nlarity within each modality. Then, separate GAT en-\ncoders (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018) are employed to ob-\ntain dense embeddings of samples, by propagating\ninformation between neighbors. Finally, tabular,\ntext and image embeddings are combined by inter-\nmodality attention to obtaining the fused embed-\nding for multimodal classification. GNNs (Yang\net al., 2020; Guo et al., 2021) show great capability\nto leverage the graph structure, propagate informa-\ntion, integrate features, and capture higher-order\nrelationships. This leads to accurate and robust\nclassification performance across various domains.\nsamples\nTabular\nText\nImage\nsamples\nsamples\nGATtab\nGATtxt\nGATimg\nTab. embs\nFused embs.\nMUGNET\nAdaptive Multiplex\nGraph Construction\nsamples\nInter-modality \nAttention\nTxt. embs\nImg. embs\nFigure 3: Model architecture of MUGNET.\nIn this work, we propose to regard the whole sam-\nples as a correlation network (Wang et al., 2021;\nGeorgantas and Richiardi, 2022) that represents\nsample-to-sample similarities, while existing mul-\ntimodal classifiers rarely consider this before.\nAdaptive multiplex graph construction module.\nFollowing the notation defined in §5.1, the adaptive\nmultiplex graph construction module first utilizes\npre-processing pipelines (e.g., monotonically in-\ncreasing integer mapping for categorical inputs, no\nalteration for numerical inputs) or pre-trained fea-\nture extractors (e.g., CLIP (Radford et al., 2021)\nfor text and image inputs) to obtain dense mul-\ntimodal features F = f(XL) ∈RN×(dt+ds+di),\nwhere F = {Ft, Fs, Fi} denotes feature matri-\nces for tabular, text, and image modalities. The\nadaptive multiplex graph construction module then\nderives multiplex sample-wise similarity graph\nG = {Gt, Gs, Gi} = {(At, Ft),\n(As, Fs), (Ai, Fi)}, where each modality-specific\nadjacency matrix Am ∈RN×N, ∀m ∈{t, s, i} is\ncalculated based on the multimodal features\nAm\ni,j = sim(Fm\ni , Fm\nj ).\n(1)\nIt is worth noting that the sample-wise similarity\nfunction sim is adaptive, and is chosen from co-\nsine similarity, radial basis function (RBF) ker-\nnel, or k-nearest neighbor. For these modality-\nspecific graphs, we use separate hyperparameters\n(e.g., threshold for score-based functions, or the\nvalue of k for k-nearest neighbor) to control their\nsparsity properties. The similarity function and its\nassociated hyperparameters are determined through\nhyperparameter tuning (Liaw et al., 2018) on the\nheld-out validation set, so that the multiplex graph\nconstruction is adaptive to any downstream task.\nGAT encoder module.\nWe use the power-\nful multi-head graph attention neural network\n(GAT) (Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2018) as the encoder to\nobtain structure-aware representations of samples.\nSeparate GATs are employed for each view of the\nmultiple graph, so that Hm = GAT(Am, Fm; θ),\nwhere Hm ∈RN×dm\nh , and θ represents the learn-\nable parameters of the GAT encoder. We want to\nstate there is no information leakage in MUGNET,\nbecause we follow the inductive learning setting\nof GNNs (Hamilton et al., 2017) where the GAT\nencoder is trained on the multiplex graph G de-\nrived from labeled training samples XL, and new\nunseen multiplex graph is derived from all sam-\nples XL ∪XU at the inference stage.\nFurther-\nmore, we adopt a graph sampling technique (Graph-\nSAINT (Zeng et al., 2019)) during the GAT train-\ning process, to improve the efficiency and general-\nization. The graph sampling technique essentially\nsamples a subgraph by random walks for each train-\ning step, thus the “neighbor explosion” issue is al-\nleviated with a constrained number of neighbors\nper node and the variance of GAT is reduced with\nfewer outliers or noise in the sampled graph.\nAttention-based fusion module. After we obtain\nthe structure-aware embeddings of samples from\nthe tabular, text, and image modalities Ht, Hs, Hi,\nthe attention-based fusion module is responsible\nfor fusing them into one single embedding via\nthe attention-based fusion module. The attention\nweight αm\nj ∈R for j-th sample of modality m is\ncomputed as:\nαm\nj =\nexp(em\nj )\nP\nm′∈{t,s,j} exp(em′\nj ),\n(2)\nem\nj = wa2 · tanh(W m\na1hm\nj ),\n(3)\nwhere em\nj ∈R denotes the unnormalized attention\nweight, wa2 ∈Rdm\na ×1, Wa1 ∈Rdm\nh ×dm\na denote\nlearnable parameters, and hm\nj ∈Rdm\nh denotes the\nj-th row of Hm (i.e., embedding of j-th sample of\nmodality m). The fused embedding of j-th sample\nis then calculated by:\nhj = αt\njht\nj + αs\njhs\nj + αi\njhi\ni.\n(4)\nThe fused embedding hj incorporates cross-\nmodalities interactions and provides a complete\ncontext for the downstream tasks.\nAn addi-\ntional two-layer MLP is trained to predict the\ncategory of j-th sample ˆyj = softmax(Wcls2 ·\nLeakyReLU(Wcls1hj)). We adopt cross-entropy\nbetween prediction ˆy and target y as MUGNET’s\nloss function.\n5\nExperiments\n5.1\nProblem Definition\nGiven a finite set of categories Y and labeled train-\ning pairs (xi, yi) ∈XL × Y, multimodal classifica-\ntion aims at finding a classifier ˆf : XL →Y such\nthat ˆyj = ˆf(xj) is a good approxmiation of the\nunknown label yj for unseen sample xj ∈XU. It\nis worth noting that the each multimodal sample\nx ∈XL ∪XU consists of tabular fields t, textual\nfields s, and image fields i (i.e., x = {t, s, i}).\n5.2\nExperimental Setup\nWe use the official training, validation, and testing\nsplits provided by MUG to conduct experiments.\nWe choose the log-loss and accuracy to evaluate\nmodel performance, since these metrics are rea-\nsonable and commonly used in previous studies.\nFor comparable and reproducible results, all mod-\nels are trained and tested using the same hardware.\nSpecifically, the machine is equipped with 16 Intel\nXeon Gold 6254 CPUs (18 cores per CPU) and one\n24GB TITAN RTX GPU. We add an 8-hour time\nlimitation for the training process to reflect real-\nworld resource constraints. The implementation\nand hyperparameter details of evaluated models are\nput in Appendix C.\n5.3\nPerformance Comparisons\nTable 2a and 2b show the performance of all eval-\nuated models on MUG. As can be seen, multi-\nmodal classifiers (except AutoMM) consistently\noutperform unimodal classifiers in both log-loss\nand accuracy.\nIt demonstrates that the classifi-\ncation tasks in MUG are multimodal-dependent\nwhere each modality only conveys partial informa-\ntion about the required outputs. Among the three\nmultimodal classifiers we used, AutoGluon and\nMUGNET are the top-2 models with well-matched\nperformances. In Table 2a and 2b, AutoGluon\nachieves the best performance eight times, while\nMUGNET also achieves the best performance eight\ntimes. More specifically, AutoGluon is superior in\nlog-loss whereas MUGNET has better accuracy\nscores. AutoMM performs the worst among multi-\nmodal classifiers, and it sometimes underperforms\nunimodal classifiers. Considering that AutoMM\ntrains powerful deep neural networks on a small\nscale of datasets and we have observed the gap\nbetween the training loss and validation loss, it is\nhighly possible that AutoMM is overfitting. While\nAutoGluon and MUGNET also adopt deep neu-\nral networks as base models, they are more robust\nsince AutoGluon proposes a repeated bagging strat-\negy and MUGNET utilizes graph sampling tech-\nniques to avoid overfitting. Among unimodal clas-\nsifiers, tabular models seem to outperform textual\nand visual models in most cases (six out of eight\ndatasets). There is a slight performance gain com-\nparing textual models to visual models because\ntextual models are better on five datasets.\nTo better understand the overall performance of\nmodels across multiple datasets, we propose using\ncritical difference (CD) diagrams (Demšar, 2006).\nIn a CD diagram, the average rank of each model\nand which ranks are statistically significantly dif-\nferent from each other are shown.

Trade-off\noften exists between how accurate the model is\nGBM\ntabMLP\nRoBERTa\nElectra\nViT\nSwin\nAutoGluon\nAutoMM\nMUGNET\n101\n102\n103\n104\nTraining Duration (seconds)\nFigure 5: Training duration on all datasets.\nand how long it takes to train and infer the model.\nTherefore, we record the training durations and test\ndurations of models to examine their efficiency. In\nFigure 5, we show the aggregated training dura-\ntion of evaluated models via a box plot. As can\nbe seen, tabular models require an order of magni-\ntude less training duration than the other models,\nwhile AutoGluon stands out as requiring signif-\nicantly longer training duration. Among tabular\nmodels, tabMLP is 4x faster than GBM in terms\nof the median training duration. Except for tabular\nmodels and AutoGluon, other models are approxi-\nmately lightweight to train. It is worth noting that\nAutoGluon hits the 8-hour training duration con-\nstraint on every dataset, thus the variance of its\ntraining durations across datasets is very small.\nIn Figure 6, we show the trade-offs between\nmean inference time and mean accuracy of models.\nSince the accuracy is not commensurable across\ndatasets, we first normalize all accuracies through\na dataset-wise min-max normalization. After the\nnormalization, the best model in each dataset is\nscaled to 1 while the worst model is scaled to 0.\nFinally, we take the average on the normalized ac-\ncuracies and the test durations to draw the scatter\nplot. When both accuracy and efficiency are objec-\ntives models try to improve, there does not exist a\nmodel that achieves the best in both objectives si-\nmultaneously. As an illustration, MUGNET has the\nhighest test accuracy, but tabMLP has the fastest\ninference speed. Therefore, we adopt the Pareto-\noptimal3 concept to identify which models achieve\n“optimal” trade-offs. Pareto-optimal is widely used\nin the decision-making process for multi-objective\noptimization scenarios. By definition, a solution\nis Pareto-optimal if any of the objectives cannot\n3Pareto-optimal Definition: https:\/\/w.wiki\/6sLB\nbe improved without degrading at least one of the\nother objectives. Following this concept, we ob-\nserve that tabMLP, GBM, and MUGNET are the\nmodels with the best trade-offs between accuracy\nand efficiency, as these models reside in the Pareto\nfrontier in Figure 6. Meanwhile, other models are\nsuboptimal with regard to this trade-off, since we\ncan always find a solution that has higher accu-\nracy and better efficiency simultaneously than these\nmodels.\n10−2\n10−1\n100\n101\n102\n103\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nGBM\ntabMLP\nRoBERTa\nElectra\nViT\nSwin\nAutoGluon\nAutoMM\nMUGNET\nTest Duration (seconds)\nTest Accuracy\nFigure 6: Mean testing duration and mean normalized\naccuracy tradeoffs on all datasets.\n6\nConclusion\nThis paper presents a benchmark dataset MUGNET\nalong with multiple baselines as a starting point for\nthe machine learning community to improve upon.\nMUGNET is a multimodal classification bench-\nmark on game data that covers tabular, textual, and\nvisual modalities. All eight datasets and nine evalu-\nated baselines are open-source and easily-extended\nto motivate rapid iteration and reproducible ex-\nperiments for researchers. A comprehensive set\nof analyses is included to provide insight into the\ncharacteristics of the benchmark. The experimen-\ntal results reported in the paper are obtained from\nmodels trained with constrained resources, which\nis often required by real-life applications. However,\nwe also welcome future works that utilize enor-\nmous resources. Finally, we hope this work can\nfacilitate research on multimodal learning, and we\nencourage any extensions to MUGNET to support\nnew tasks or applications such as open-domain re-\ntrieval, AI-generated content, multimodal QA, etc.\nLimitations\nWhile our study emphasizes the importance of effi-\nciency in real-world machine learning applications,\nwe acknowledge certain limitations in our approach.\nSpecifically, we deliberately focused on training\nand evaluating relatively \"small\" models within the\ncontext of the current era of large vision and lan-\nguage models (LVLMs) (Li et al., 2023; Liu et al.,\n2023; Lu et al., 2023). As a result, the performance\nof LVLMs on our proposed MUG benchmark re-\nmains unexplored. Early exploration (Hegselmann\net al., 2023) about applying large language models\non tabular classification shows that LLMs can be\ncompetitive with strong tree-based models. Based\non the explorations and conducted experiments, we\nspeculate LLVMs can not beat efficient ensemble\nor GNN baselines using the same training time\nconstraint. However, to provide a comprehensive\nunderstanding of multimodal classification, further\nresearch is expected. It would be also intriguing to\ninvestigate the performance of LLVMs when pro-\nvided with unlimited training (fine-tuning) time.\nAcknowledgement\nThis research is partly supported by the National\nInstitute Of Diabetes And Digestive And Kidney\nDiseases of the National Institutes of Health under\nAward Number K25DK135913 and the Division\nof Mathematical Sciences of the National Science\nFoundation under Award Number 2208412.

Introduction\nThe video game industry boasts an estimated annual rev-\nenue of USD 217 billion [57] with a total of 3.2 billion\ngamers worldwide in 2022 [1]. Automatically detecting in-\ngame glitches is, therefore, a highly demanding task, but\nthat remains a long-standing challenge [12, 39, 51, 55, 56,\n65, 66, 72, 83]. A glitch is an unexpected frame that occurs\nwithin a game due to either an unforeseen software bug,\nplayer actions, or unanticipated interactions between game\nelements and does not result in a program crash. From a\ncomputer vision perspective, glitch detection involves rec-\nognizing an extremely wide spectrum of long-tail video\nframes, from rendering (e.g., 3D objects with missing tex-\ntures; Fig. 2f), unrealistic physics (e.g., two people sitting\nin an invisible car; Fig. 2b), to semantic errors (e.g., indoor\nrain; Fig. 1). Unlike software bugs that can be caught by\nexamining the code alone, glitches are more non-trivial to\ndetect because they are mostly the result of a one-time event\nthat unexpectedly happens in-game.\nA holy grail of game quality assurance is to build a\nGPT-4V fails to focus on the rain inside the room\nQuestion: What is wrong with this image?\nGround truth: It is raining inside the building\nGPT-4V: There’s nothing inherently “wrong” with\nthis image; however, if you’re referring to\ninconsistencies or peculiarities that might not align\nwith the established Batman canon, the red Batman\nsuit is unusual since Batman is traditionally known\nin black or very dark colors. The use of red could\nbe an artistic choice for the game, an alternate suit\navailable within the game’s universe, or indicative\nof a different character who takes on the Batman\nmantle.\nFigure 1. The image depicts a screenshot in which it rains inside\na room. While the rain should be what is wrong with the image,\nGPT-4V fails to reason correctly and instead focuses on the color\nof Batman’s costume. Note that the ground truth is never presented\nas part of the prompt in our study.\ngeneral glitch detector that works for any game of any\ngenre and mechanics.\nWe set the first step toward this\ngoal by building GlitchBench, an evaluation benchmark\nof 593 glitches, leveraging the public’s crowd knowledge\nfrom the game community’s reports on reddit.com\/r\/\nGamePhysics. The glitches span across 205 games of\nvarious genres. Each glitch has a video clip, a representa-\ntive frame, a one-line description, and a reference to a cor-\nresponding Reddit thread where gamers discussed the error.\narXiv:2312.05291v2  [cs.CV]  29 Mar 2024\nLarge image-text, multimodal models (LMMs), such as\nGPT-4V [2], are improving at an unprecedentedly fast pace.\nThey excel in many existing tasks, including object detec-\ntion [44, 75], multi-step reasoning [4, 5, 10, 35], and de-\ntailed image captioning [2, 38, 42, 52, 76]. Testing LMMs\non GlitchBench may yield important findings not only to\nthe game industry but also to the Artificial Intelligence (AI)\ncommunity because glitch detection requires a combination\nof knowledge and understanding of image aesthetics, com-\nputer graphics, physics and commonsense reasoning (skills\nthat are often tested individually in a benchmark [8]).\nIn this paper, we evaluate how well LMMs perform in\ndetecting glitches from a single frame. Our main findings\nand contributions include:\n1. We introduce GlitchBench,\nwhich contains 330\nglitch-free and 593 glitch screens taken from 205 games\nfor evaluating LMMs (Sec. 3).\n2. We evaluate 11 state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-\n4V [2] and LLaVA [42] on our benchmark and in com-\nparison with the performance on 6 other common bench-\nmarks (Sec. 4).\n3. LMMs are better at detecting glitches that violate sim-\nple physical laws (e.g., a car flying in the air) than other\nmore subtle glitches (e.g., human limbs in an implausi-\nble pose; Fig. 6).\n4. The state-of-the-art model on GlitchBench is GPT-4V\nwith 43.4% accuracy. In the extensive captioning setup,\nwe estimated the upper limits of models, and GPT-4V\ncan achieve an accuracy of 64.9%, which is almost twice\nthat of LLaVA, the second-best model (30.5%).\n5. In sum,\nthere exists a headroom of 30–35% on\nGlitchBench for future LMM models to improve, pre-\nsenting an interesting challenge to the AI community.\n2. Related Work\n2.1. Multimodal, image-text datasets\nRecently, there has been rapid development of large multi-\nmodal models that can process multiple modalities, includ-\ning visual and textual inputs. Existing datasets that come\nwith human-generated image captions, such as COCO Cap-\ntion [13], Nocaps [3], CapFilt: [36] and Flickr30k [53], can\nserve as a simple way to evaluate language models. By\nproviding the image, we can ask a model to describe it\nand then compare the generated caption with the ground\ntruth [42, 43, 77]. Image captioning is a narrow domain\nand can be extended into visual question answering (VQA)\nby asking questions related to an image.\nDatasets like\nGQA [27], OK-VQA [49], VQAv2 [22], and Vizwiz [23]\ncontain image-question pairs to probe the visual reasoning\nand understanding of LMMs.\nBuilding upon simple VQAs, several benchmarks aim\nto increase the complexity of tasks over different dimen-\nsions. TextVQA [63], OCR-VQA [50] and TextCap[62]\npropose questions about the text shown in the image. Sci-\nenceQA [47] and MathVista [48] focus on scientific top-\nics and charts, while VCR [80] and Sherlock [80] fo-\ncus on commonsense reasoning. Moreover, AI2D [26] is\ndirected at questions concerning scientific diagrams, and\nIconQA [46] targets the comprehension of abstract dia-\ngrams.\nEach of these benchmarks is designed to push\nthe boundaries of VQA systems by introducing specialized\ncontent that requires advanced reasoning and understand-\ning.\nThere are also comprehensive evaluation frameworks\nthat assess multimodal language models across a wider\nspectrum of capabilities. These evaluations extend beyond\nvisual and textual reasoning to encompass a variety of skills\nsuch as generation, question answering, adherence to in-\nstructions, and the application of commonsense logic. No-\ntable among these are SEED-Bench [33] , MME [19], MM-\nBench [45], MM-Vet [79], VisIT-Bench [8], which collec-\ntively serve to provide a robust measure of a model’s profi-\nciency in handling tasks that integrate multiple modalities.\nUnlike traditional datasets that contain queries about el-\nements present in the image, our approach is novel in di-\nrecting models to discern the atypical aspects, i.e., glitches,\nwith no linguistic hints provided. We show an image to the\nmodel and ask it to report unusual aspects of it. Such ques-\ntions require a more integrated approach to visual and lin-\nguistic processing within an LMM to formulate a response.\n2.2. Vision-language Stress Testing\nOut-of-distribution (OOD) datasets have become a corner-\nstone for evaluating the capabilities and progress of ma-\nchine learning models.\nIn standard image classification,\nin particular the ImageNet [59] dataset, the introduction of\ndatasets [24, 25, 25, 64] has underscored the importance of\nrobustness and generalization in model evaluation. As we\nmove from simple image classification tasks to more com-\nplex multimodal tasks, there is an increasing need for sim-\nilar OOD datasets that can comprehensively test the gener-\nalization abilities of LMMs.\nThere are several studies that stress test various aspects\nof vision from different angles, such as compositional and\nspatial reasoning [20, 28, 29, 67], objects placed out of con-\ntext and implausible scenes [9, 14, 84], and the exploitation\nof language and vision priors [18, 40].\nThe closest benchmark to ours is Whoops [9], which is\ndesigned to challenge commonsense knowledge and rea-\nsoning in LMMs. However, our dataset differs in several\nways: (1) The tasks in GlitchBench come from real-\nworld tasks, specifically video game quality assurance, and\nare not artificially created to test models. (2) Whoops re-\nquires cultural and background knowledge to answer; for\nexample, A panda bear is catching salmon fish is unusual\n(a) A person stuck in a piece of furniture\n(b) Two people driving an invisible car\n(c) A rifle floating in the air\n(d) A person is floating in the air\n(e) The gun in the hand is missing\n(f) The table cover has a placeholder texture\nFigure 2. Sample images from the GlitchBench showing glitches in various games with distinct styles. Samples (a)–(e) are captured\nfrom online videos, while sample (f) is generated inside the Unity game engine.\nsince pandas subsist almost entirely on bamboo. In contrast,\nour dataset contains samples that contradict basic common-\nsense and the physics of the world. (3) Finally, images in\nWhoops are synthesized using image-to-text models; they\nare clear without artifacts, centered in the image, and do not\nstress the visual side of the image, focusing on the context.\nIn contrast, for GlitchBench, models need to fully scan\nthe image to identify its unusual aspects (Fig. 2), and there\nare many distracting elements present in the image, chal-\nlenging them to focus on the correct part of the image.\n2.3. Empirical Analysis of Recent LMMs\nWith the release of recent proprietary LLMs, such as GPT-\n4V and Bard [21], some studies attempt to evaluate and\nreport the performance of these models on various bench-\nmarks and tasks [16, 54, 73]. The main goal of these stud-\nies is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the mod-\nels across various well-established tasks and some narrow\ndomains [71, 74]. The main difference between our work\nand these studies is that we propose a general, stress-testing\nbenchmark to measure the generalization power of vari-\nous LLMs, both proprietary and open source, on a specific,\nglitch-detection task in the game industry.\n3. GlitchBench\nIn this section, we describe the creation process of\nGlitchBench, a benchmark aimed at stress-testing visual\nperception and commonsense reasoning in LMMs, moti-\nvated by real-world game quality assurance tasks.\nDuring development, video games go through many\nstages of testing to reach certain quality standards before\nrelease. However, even after release, they can still exhibit\nunusual in-game events, or glitches. Glitches, often viewed\nas annoying bugs, can also possess a humorous and en-\ntertaining aspect. Players frequently report glitches across\nvarious social media platforms, particularly on Reddit and\nYouTube. A critical aspect of understanding glitches is the\nrequirement of commonsense knowledge about the basic\nlaws of physics of the game’s universe, making them a suit-\nable and practical candidate for testing machine learning\nmodels. Fig. 2 shows six samples from GlitchBench.\n3.1. Constructing the Dataset\nGlitchBench contains two parts: (1) 513 samples shared\nby players of video games, i.e., frames collected from on-\nline sources, and (2) 75 synthetic samples.\nSamples shared by players of video games:\nTo con-\nstruct our dataset, we sampled 1,000 videos from the Game-\nPhysics [66] dataset. This dataset consists of videos from a\nsubreddit with the same name, containing gameplay video\nclips with unusual events and glitches.\nNext, we conducted a manual review process to filter\nvideos based on two criteria: (1) the presence of a glitch\nin the video, and (2) the potential for humans to detect the\nglitch from a single frame. The second criterion is key be-\ncause certain glitches, such as those involving rapid shaking\nor changes in size over time, cannot be detected from a still\nimage alone.\nAfter applying these filters, we extracted one frame from\neach remaining video, resulting in a collection of 650 sam-\nples. Our final round of manual reviews revealed two poten-\ntial issues: (1) some glitches are not detectable from the ex-\ntracted image and require more context to understand, and\n(2) some images contain the faces of gamers who streamed\nthe content on an online platform (which could cause the\nLMM to identify these faces as what is wrong with the im-\nages). After removing videos that contain one of these is-\nsues, our final glitch set contains 513 images.\nGenerating synthetic samples with Unity:\nTo enhance\nour dataset, we supplemented samples from the Game-\nPhysics dataset with 75 synthetic examples created inside\nthe Unity game engine. These samples were specifically\ndesigned to mimic a subset of common development-stage\nbugs [39, 55, 65] that are not readily available in online so-\ncial media platforms and, hence, to diminish the survivor\nbias effect. These flaws are often fixed before the public\nrelease of a game through the quality assurance process of\na game development company and are therefore not often\nposted on social media.\nOur synthetic sample generation process involves the\ninjection of three categories of glitches into each scene:\n(1) placeholder textures, (2) object mesh distortions, and\n(3) low-resolution textures.\nGlitch-free images:\nOur focus is on glitch frames, as they\nare more challenging to capture and collect. However, to es-\ntablish a baseline for comparison, we also included a set\nof glitch-free images.\nTo accomplish this, we randomly\nselected gameplay walkthroughs from various games on\nYouTube. From these walkthroughs, we extracted a random\nsubset of frames, resulting in the compilation of a dataset\nconsisting of 330 frames sourced from a diverse array of\ngames. The groundtruth captions for these glitch-free im-\nages is “There is nothing wrong with this image”.\n3.2. Labeling the Dataset\nFor all images, we provide a short description of the glitch\npresent in the image. Our goal is to label the images briefly,\nhighlighting only the unusual elements in simple language.\nFor instance, if an image depicts a character with a con-\ntorted physique, the label would simply state, “character\nhas an unnatural body position”.\nIt is important to highlight that some images can be de-\nscribed in many different ways. Diverse phrases such as\n“falling from the sky”, “suspended in mid-air”, or “jump-\ning in the air” might all refer to a single event. Instead of\nhandling such cases in the labeling process, in the evalua-\ntion process, we incorporate a language model to diminish\nthe effect of this (see Sec. 4.1).\n3.3. Categorizing the Glitch Types in the Images\nIn this section, we provide a high-level categorization of\nglitches in our dataset.\nWhile there have been some at-\ntempts to provide a taxonomy of video game bugs [32, 69],\nthese taxonomies do not provide descriptions that are ade-\nquate to automate bug categorization.\nWe propose a novel human-AI team-based method to\nbuild a categorization based on the descriptions of the im-\nages. This process is a collaborative effort between GPT-4\nand humans, where GPT-4 suggests initial categories, and\nthen humans refine these suggestions by providing feed-\nback or asking the model to re-evaluate its output, harness-\ning the reflective ability of GPT-4 [61]. Finally, we man-\nually bridge the resulting categories to those proposed by\nLewis et al. [32] based on the semantics and instances of\nthe glitches in our dataset.\nProcess:\nWe prompt GPT-4 with all the glitch descrip-\ntions in our dataset and ask it to generate a categorization\nbased on the descriptions and semantics of the glitches. In\neach subsequent iteration, we provide feedback in one of\ntwo ways: (1) we ask GPT-4 to review its previous answer\nthrough reflection, or (2) we explicitly instruct the model\nto merge two categories that are semantically similar. We\nstop when the model no longer changes its answer through\nreflection or when we can no longer merge categories.\nIn the last step, to assign each image to a category, we\nprompt GPT-4 with the description of the glitch and the final\ncategories and ask it to assign each image to one of them.\nThe final categories, the number of instances, examples for\neach category, and the parent category proposed by Lewis\net al. [32] are outlined in Table 1.\n4. Experiments\n4.1. Experimental Setup\nFormulating Questions:\nWe designed GlitchBench as\na free-text response benchmark, in contrast with traditional\nLMM benchmarks that utilize Yes\/No or multiple-choice\nformats [19, 33]. We ask models to describe the unusual\naspects of an image by answering three questions:\n(Q1) What is unusual about this image?\n(Q2) What is wrong with this image?\n(Q3) Describe the image in detail\nNote that we do not explicitly use the word glitch in the\nquestion, and we use simple language similar to what a\nlayperson would use. During the inference, we allow mod-\nels to come up with their own reasoning, and after the model\ngenerates the full response, we record it for further evalua-\ntion and comparison with the ground truth.\nThe rationale for free-text answers is that including an\n‘unusual’ event description among choices hints to the\nLMM, letting it answer while disregarding visual aspects.\nTable 1. Categorization of video game glitches in GlitchBench.\nNumbers highlighted in ■show the number of images in each\ncategory. Categories highlighted in ■show the corresponding cat-\negories proposed by Lewis et al. [32].\nPhysics, Collision, and Spawn\nImages: 422\n(Non-Temporal →Invalid position)\n1.\nObjects and characters floating or stuck in the air\n(Fig. 2d).\n2. Characters or objects clipping through solid objects like\nwalls, floors, or ground.\n3. Vehicles or characters falling under the game map.\nAnimation and Pose\nImages: 75\n(Non-Temporal →Invalid graphical representation)\n1. Unusual or impossible body poses and positions (Fig. 6).\n2. Characters in a T-pose or with distorted body parts.\n3. Incorrect animations for certain actions.\nRendering and Texture\nImages: 67\n(Non-Temporal →Invalid graphical representation)\n1. Mesh stretches or objects with distorted shapes.\n2. Missing textures or objects displaying a “default” place-\nholder texture (Fig. 2f).\n3. Objects with low-resolution.\nCamera, User Interface, and Lighting\nImages: 26\n(Non-Temporal →Invalid value change)\n1. Camera issues such as clipping inside objects or im-\nproper character views.\n2. In-game menus displaying incorrect elements.\n3. Shadows or lighting effects that do not match the envi-\nronment.\nWe included question Q3 to assess whether the mod-\nels can accurately report any glitches or unusual elements\nwithin the image in extensive captioning.\nEssentially,\nthis question serves as a visual perception test, evaluating\nwhether the models can identify and describe unusual as-\npects of the image in a more relaxed condition. For exam-\nple, in the sample shown in Fig. 1, we test the model to see\nif it can identify the presence of rain in the room. In this\ncase, it indicates that it is raining outside.\nEvaluation:\nFollowing recent successes [8, 41, 78, 82]\nwe employ a language model as a judge to evaluate the\nmodel’s responses. We use Llama-2-70B-Chat [68] to com-\npare the model-generated text with the ground truth and de-\ntermine whether the text conveys the same meaning or men-\ntions the event highlighted by the ground truth (see Fig. 3).\nWe report the accuracy of each model on each tested\nquestion and present the average performance for Q1 and\nThe image shows a car ﬂipped \nupside down in mid-air, which is \nan unusual and unrealistic \nsituation for a standard vehicle, \nsuggesting that it's either a scene \nfrom a video game or a result of \ndigital manipulation. \nGround Truth:\nA car is upside down in the \nair.\nYes\nNo\nWhat is wrong with this image?\nJudge\n (Llama-2)\nFigure 3. To evaluate a model’s response, we ask a judge (the\nLlama-2-70b-Chat model) to compare it semantically with the\nground truth.\nQ2 as the final benchmark result. Q3 serves as the visual\nperception test, and we report the performance of the mod-\nels on it separately.\nTo assess Llama-2’s judgment and determine if it can\neffectively serve as an evaluator, we manually reviewed a\nsubset of responses for each model. For each model, we\nmanually labeled 20 samples, with a total of 220 samples.\nModels:\nIn total, we evaluated 11 LMMs, including GPT-\n4V [2], and 10 open source models: LLaVA-1.5 (7B and\n13B) [42], SPHINX (7B and 13B) [38], InstructBLIP (7B\nand 13B) [17], Qwen-VL-Chat (10B) [6], MiniGPT-v2\n(7B) [11], OtterHD [34], and Fuyo (8B) [7]. We used the\ndefault temperature and top-p configurations provided with\nthe model and API. We increased max token to get full\nresponses from models. (See Sec. A1 for details).\n4.2. Quantitative Results\nTable 2 shows the performance of all the tested models for\nthe three questions. The Average performance on Q1 and\nQ2 is the main result of our benchmark. GPT-4V is the best-\nperforming model, achieving 57.2% (Q1) and 29.5% (Q2)\nand an average of 43.4%. Next, LLaVA-1.5-13B achieves\nan average of 35.5% and is the best performing open-source\nmodel. These findings show GlitchBench is challenging\nfor even state-of-the-art commercial & open-source models.\nThe performance of GPT-4V on glitch-free images is\nmuch higher than on glitch images, with an average accu-\nracy of 91.6%, which suggests that glitch-free images are\nmuch easier to handle.\nModels exhibit different performance depending on the\nquestions being asked, but all except for the SPHINX family\nshow better performance when prompted with Q1. Never-\ntheless, the gap in performance varies, with GPT-4V show-\ning the largest gap of 27.7pp (57.2% vs. 29.5%). These\nresults highlight that different prompts steer the behavior\nTable 2.

In particular, SPHINX-13B, which oper-\nates at a higher resolution than SPHINX-7B (448 × 448 vs.\n224×224), on average performs +2.9 pp (27.9% vs. 25.0%)\nbetter than the base model. Similarly, OtterHD, which em-\nploys Fuyu as the base model with enhanced flexibility and\nsupport for higher image resolutions, outperforms Fuyu on\naverage by +15.5 (24.0% vs. 8.5%).\nAsking LMMs to extensively caption the image using\nQ3 only triggers GPT-4V to produce a very verbose re-\nsponse. In many cases, GPT-4V describes many details in\nthe image and can touch upon the unusual aspects of the\nimage. In this setup, GPT-4V can achieve 64.9%, which is\nan increase of +7.7 over Q1 and +21.5 pp better than the\nbenchmark results. This gap suggests that GPT-4V can see\nmany details in the image, but it cannot easily focus on the\nunusual aspects in the frame, indicating a gap in its reason-\ning capabilities across different modalities and prompts.\nHuman evaluation:\nTable 3 shows the results of com-\nparing between Llama-2 judgments and human evaluations,\nwith the level of agreement for each model measured by\nCohen’s Kappa [15]. Cohen’s Kappa demonstrates vary-\ning levels of concordance for each model. GPT-4V (0.80),\nInstructBLIP-7B (0.83), and Qwen-VL (1.00) exhibit sub-\nstantial to perfect agreement. In contrast, OtterHD (0.50)\nhad fair agreement, and Fuyu (-0.09) shows less than chance\nagreement, suggesting significant discrepancies. Overall,\non all models except for Fuyu, we found above moderate\nagreement between Llama-2 and human judgment, while\non six models, this agreement is substantial.\nAccuracy breakdown by category of glitches:\nFig. 4\nshows the breakdown of the performance of all tested mod-\nels across the four studied glitch categories.\nGPT-4V is\nthe best-performing model across all categories, with the\nTable 3.

Overall, the Animation and Pose category consis-\ntently proves to be the most challenging. This category con-\ntains images of characters in unusual poses, distorted body\njoints, or twisted bodies (see an example in Fig. 6).\n4.3. Qualitative Observations and Analysis\nFailing to reason about unusual aspects of the image:\nWe observed that in several cases, particularly in open-\nsource models, the model reports phrases such as “the prob-\nlem with this image is that it is computer-generated” or “this\nis not an actual scene but a scene from a video game”, along\nwith similar phrases conveying the same meaning. These\nphrases suggest that, despite the model’s ability to see the\ncontent of the image, the language component of the model\ncompletely fails to reason about the content of the image.\nAnother observation is that InstructBLIP-13B often re-\nsponds with “nothing” or similar phrases and completely\nfails to reason about the image. This is the reason why\nthe smaller InstructBLIP-7B can achieve higher accuracy\non GlitchBench. (See Sec. A3.1 for samples.)\nGPT-4V struggles with faces:\nGPT-4V is the best-\nperforming model, yet it struggles with characters’ faces,\nas shown in Fig. 5. We found several issues when process-\ning glitches related to faces, and in the majority of cases,\nGPT-4V fails to detect the glitch and sometimes halluci-\nnates about characters wearing costumes (Fig. A2), where\nthere are basically no discernible facial features. On the\nother hand, smaller open-source models can sometimes de-\ntect glitches where GPT-4V fails, but they cannot describe\nthe glitch clearly. We hypothesize that this might be due to\nthe privacy features of GPT-4V, preventing it from seeing\nthe face clearly (see Sec. A3.2 for more samples).\nPoor performance in the Animation and Pose category:\nFig. 4 shows that Animation and Pose is the hardest cate-\ngory of glitches. During manual analysis, we found that\nLMMs struggle to detect unnatural body and limb config-\nurations and incorrect animations being displayed. For in-\nstance, Fig. 6 shows an example of an unnatural arm posi-\ntion for a basketball player that GPT-4V cannot detect. This\ncategory can be further divided into three subcategories:\n(1) Heavily distorted body, e.g., when a character’s body is\noverstretched or expanded; (2) Nuances in body configura-\ntion, such as contorted or twisted limbs and hands (Fig. 6);\nand (3) Characters playing animations with invisible props\n(e.g., a missing gun in the hand, as shown in Fig. 2e).\nPrevalent hallucination in open-source models:\nHallu-\ncination typically refers to situations in which the model’s\ngenerated text contains information not present in the im-\nage [16, 58, 81, 85]. We noticed that open-source models\noften hallucinate extra objects or content in the image, e.g.,\nwe found that Fuyu’s responses almost always contain hal-\nlucinations (see Sec. A3.4). The hallucination can contain\nadditional characters or entirely new objects. These extra\nelements sometimes mislead Llama-2 into accepting an in-\ncorrect response as correct (see Sec. A3.5).\nGPT-4V fails to recognize the absence of facial skin\nQuestion: What is wrong with this image?\nGround truth: The character’s face mesh is not\nrendered correctly.\nGPT-4V: The image appears to be from a video\ngame or some form of CGI (computer-generated\nimagery) with very high-quality rendering. The\ncharacters depicted are very lifelike, suggesting a\nsignificant level of detail and investment in\ngraphics. However, there’s nothing inherently\n“wrong” with the image in terms of content; it\nseems to portray a close-up moment between two\ncharacters.\nLlama-2 (Judge): No, the generated description\ndoes not accurately convey the key information and\nthemes of the ground truth. While it acknowledges\nthe high quality of the graphics and the lifelike\nnature of the characters, it does not address the\nissue of the character’s face mesh not being\nrendered correctly, which is the main focus of the\nground truth.\nFigure 5. One of the several cases in which GPT-4V fails to detect\na problem with facial features.\nDetecting some glitches requires paying attention to\nsmall details:\nDifferent glitches in our dataset require\nvarying levels of visual attention. For example, when a car\nis flying in the air (Fig. A11), it usually occupies a large\nportion of the pixels on the screen, and models can easily\npick up on such issues. This type of glitch is easier to catch,\nand GPT-4V, in particular, is very accurate at detecting it.\nSome types of glitches require close attention to detail,\nsuch as clipping issues with clothing, where parts of the\nclothes intersect with the face or body of a character. While\nGPT-4V is generally the best model for detecting clipping,\nit is still not perfect. In some cases, GPT-4V misses the\nclipping, and in other cases, it hallucinates about clipping\n(see Sec. A3.6 for samples).\nGPT-4V fails to detect unusual body configuration\nQuestion: What is unusual about this image?\nGround truth: The left hand of the basketball\nplayer is in an unusual position and is stretched\nbackward.\nGPT-4V: The image appears to be a screenshot\nfrom a basketball video game, possibly from the\nNBA 2K series. The unusual aspects of this image\ninclude: One of the players has a bright orange\nbeard that stands out from the rest. Another player\nseems to be kissing or blowing at the basketball,\nwhich is not a typical basketball move or gesture.\nThe characters and graphics look\ncomputer-generated, which indicates it’s from a\nvideo game rather than a real-life game.\nThe interface at the bottom of the image shows\nvarious controls and buttons, which further\nsuggests that it’s from a video game.\nLlama-2 (Judge): No, the generated description\ndoes not accurately convey the key information and\nthemes of the ground truth. The ground truth\nfocuses on the unusual position of the basketball\nplayer’s left hand, while the generated description\nhighlights three unusual aspects of the image, none\nof which relate to the player’s hand position.\nFigure 6. The image shows a basketball player with an unnatural,\nimpossible elbow pose. GPT-4V fails to focus on small details\nsuch as body configuration and is unable to report this issue.\n5. Discussion and Limitation\nComparing GlitchBench with other benchmarks:\nThe performance of various models across different bench-\nmarks is presented in Tab. 4. It becomes evident that GPT-\n4V shows different performance against open-source mod-\nels compared to GlitchBench. For instance, on VQAv2,\nLLaVA-1.5 and QWEN-VL score +5.8 (80.0% vs 74.2%)\nand +5.3 pp (79.5% vs 74.2%) higher than GPT-4V, respec-\ntively. However, on GlitchBench, they lag behind by -9.9\n(33.4% vs. 43.5%) and -28 pp (15.4% vs. 43.4%). The most\nTable 4.

However, their performance on\nGlitchBench, which is derived from a real-world task in\ngame quality assurance, falls significantly short of GPT-4V.\nIn other words, the performance of models in real-world\nsettings does not correlate well with existing benchmarks.\nThis discrepancy partly comes from the design choices\ntypical of LMM benchmarks, as they often opt for Yes\/No\nor multiple-choice formats [19, 33, 45].\nThese formats\nallow models to find shortcuts for scoring high without\nnecessarily generalizing well to other tasks.\nLimitation:\nWe constructed our dataset by randomly\nsampling videos and observed a prevalence of video games\nwith an open-world genre on the Reddit website. Conse-\nquently, during our sampling process, video games from\nthis genre, characterized by their distinct mechanics, were\nmore frequently represented compared to other types.\n6. Conclusion\nWe introduce GlitchBench, a new challenging bench-\nmark for evaluating multimodal models on the video game\nglitch detection task. Detecting glitches requires various\nlevels of reasoning skills, such as an understanding of the\nlaws of physics and commonsense, making it well-suited for\ntesting the generalization capabilities of large multimodal\nmodels. Comparing models’ performance on various multi-\nmodal benchmarks and GlitchBench reveals a disparity:\nHigh performance on prior benchmarks does not guarantee\nhigh performance on real-world tasks that demand extensive\nreasoning abilities. We show that GlitchBench, derived\nfrom real-world video game quality assurance, presents a\nnew challenge for the AI community and is a valuable ad-\ndition to existing multimodal benchmarks.\nAcknowledgement\nAN is supported by the NaphCare Foundation, Adobe Re-\nsearch gifts, and NSF grant no. 2145767.","pdf_path":"tools\/arxiv_tools\/asset\/pdf\/\/GlitchBench: Can large multimodal models detect video game glitches?.pdf","query_prompt":"### 任务\n你是一个人工智能领域的专家，你能够快速阅读arxiv上的各种AI前沿论文和相关博客，进而完美地回答学生的问题。\n现在请你阅读以下论文及博客，并回答学生的问题。\n\n### 论文信息\n###  1. 论文标题\n```\nGlitchBench: Can large multimodal models detect video game glitches?\n```\n#### 2. 论文摘要\n```\nLarge multimodal models (LMMs) have evolved from large language models (LLMs)\nto integrate multiple input modalities, such as visual inputs.

Introduction\nThe video game industry boasts an estimated annual rev-\nenue of USD 217 billion [57] with a total of 3.2 billion\ngamers worldwide in 2022 [1]. Automatically detecting in-\ngame glitches is, therefore, a highly demanding task, but\nthat remains a long-standing challenge [12, 39, 51, 55, 56,\n65, 66, 72, 83]. A glitch is an unexpected frame that occurs\nwithin a game due to either an unforeseen software bug,\nplayer actions, or unanticipated interactions between game\nelements and does not result in a program crash. From a\ncomputer vision perspective, glitch detection involves rec-\nognizing an extremely wide spectrum of long-tail video\nframes, from rendering (e.g., 3D objects with missing tex-\ntures; Fig. 2f), unrealistic physics (e.g., two people sitting\nin an invisible car; Fig. 2b), to semantic errors (e.g., indoor\nrain; Fig. 1). Unlike software bugs that can be caught by\nexamining the code alone, glitches are more non-trivial to\ndetect because they are mostly the result of a one-time event\nthat unexpectedly happens in-game.\nA holy grail of game quality assurance is to build a\nGPT-4V fails to focus on the rain inside the room\nQuestion: What is wrong with this image?\nGround truth: It is raining inside the building\nGPT-4V: There’s nothing inherently “wrong” with\nthis image; however, if you’re referring to\ninconsistencies or peculiarities that might not align\nwith the established Batman canon, the red Batman\nsuit is unusual since Batman is traditionally known\nin black or very dark colors. The use of red could\nbe an artistic choice for the game, an alternate suit\navailable within the game’s universe, or indicative\nof a different character who takes on the Batman\nmantle.\nFigure 1. The image depicts a screenshot in which it rains inside\na room. While the rain should be what is wrong with the image,\nGPT-4V fails to reason correctly and instead focuses on the color\nof Batman’s costume. Note that the ground truth is never presented\nas part of the prompt in our study.\ngeneral glitch detector that works for any game of any\ngenre and mechanics.\nWe set the first step toward this\ngoal by building GlitchBench, an evaluation benchmark\nof 593 glitches, leveraging the public’s crowd knowledge\nfrom the game community’s reports on reddit.com\/r\/\nGamePhysics. The glitches span across 205 games of\nvarious genres. Each glitch has a video clip, a representa-\ntive frame, a one-line description, and a reference to a cor-\nresponding Reddit thread where gamers discussed the error.\narXiv:2312.05291v2  [cs.CV]  29 Mar 2024\nLarge image-text, multimodal models (LMMs), such as\nGPT-4V [2], are improving at an unprecedentedly fast pace.\nThey excel in many existing tasks, including object detec-\ntion [44, 75], multi-step reasoning [4, 5, 10, 35], and de-\ntailed image captioning [2, 38, 42, 52, 76]. Testing LMMs\non GlitchBench may yield important findings not only to\nthe game industry but also to the Artificial Intelligence (AI)\ncommunity because glitch detection requires a combination\nof knowledge and understanding of image aesthetics, com-\nputer graphics, physics and commonsense reasoning (skills\nthat are often tested individually in a benchmark [8]).\nIn this paper, we evaluate how well LMMs perform in\ndetecting glitches from a single frame. Our main findings\nand contributions include:\n1. We introduce GlitchBench,\nwhich contains 330\nglitch-free and 593 glitch screens taken from 205 games\nfor evaluating LMMs (Sec. 3).\n2. We evaluate 11 state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-\n4V [2] and LLaVA [42] on our benchmark and in com-\nparison with the performance on 6 other common bench-\nmarks (Sec. 4).\n3. LMMs are better at detecting glitches that violate sim-\nple physical laws (e.g., a car flying in the air) than other\nmore subtle glitches (e.g., human limbs in an implausi-\nble pose; Fig. 6).\n4. The state-of-the-art model on GlitchBench is GPT-4V\nwith 43.4% accuracy. In the extensive captioning setup,\nwe estimated the upper limits of models, and GPT-4V\ncan achieve an accuracy of 64.9%, which is almost twice\nthat of LLaVA, the second-best model (30.5%).\n5. In sum,\nthere exists a headroom of 30–35% on\nGlitchBench for future LMM models to improve, pre-\nsenting an interesting challenge to the AI community.\n2. Related Work\n2.1. Multimodal, image-text datasets\nRecently, there has been rapid development of large multi-\nmodal models that can process multiple modalities, includ-\ning visual and textual inputs. Existing datasets that come\nwith human-generated image captions, such as COCO Cap-\ntion [13], Nocaps [3], CapFilt: [36] and Flickr30k [53], can\nserve as a simple way to evaluate language models. By\nproviding the image, we can ask a model to describe it\nand then compare the generated caption with the ground\ntruth [42, 43, 77]. Image captioning is a narrow domain\nand can be extended into visual question answering (VQA)\nby asking questions related to an image.\nDatasets like\nGQA [27], OK-VQA [49], VQAv2 [22], and Vizwiz [23]\ncontain image-question pairs to probe the visual reasoning\nand understanding of LMMs.\nBuilding upon simple VQAs, several benchmarks aim\nto increase the complexity of tasks over different dimen-\nsions. TextVQA [63], OCR-VQA [50] and TextCap[62]\npropose questions about the text shown in the image. Sci-\nenceQA [47] and MathVista [48] focus on scientific top-\nics and charts, while VCR [80] and Sherlock [80] fo-\ncus on commonsense reasoning. Moreover, AI2D [26] is\ndirected at questions concerning scientific diagrams, and\nIconQA [46] targets the comprehension of abstract dia-\ngrams.\nEach of these benchmarks is designed to push\nthe boundaries of VQA systems by introducing specialized\ncontent that requires advanced reasoning and understand-\ning.\nThere are also comprehensive evaluation frameworks\nthat assess multimodal language models across a wider\nspectrum of capabilities. These evaluations extend beyond\nvisual and textual reasoning to encompass a variety of skills\nsuch as generation, question answering, adherence to in-\nstructions, and the application of commonsense logic. No-\ntable among these are SEED-Bench [33] , MME [19], MM-\nBench [45], MM-Vet [79], VisIT-Bench [8], which collec-\ntively serve to provide a robust measure of a model’s profi-\nciency in handling tasks that integrate multiple modalities.\nUnlike traditional datasets that contain queries about el-\nements present in the image, our approach is novel in di-\nrecting models to discern the atypical aspects, i.e., glitches,\nwith no linguistic hints provided. We show an image to the\nmodel and ask it to report unusual aspects of it. Such ques-\ntions require a more integrated approach to visual and lin-\nguistic processing within an LMM to formulate a response.\n2.2. Vision-language Stress Testing\nOut-of-distribution (OOD) datasets have become a corner-\nstone for evaluating the capabilities and progress of ma-\nchine learning models.\nIn standard image classification,\nin particular the ImageNet [59] dataset, the introduction of\ndatasets [24, 25, 25, 64] has underscored the importance of\nrobustness and generalization in model evaluation. As we\nmove from simple image classification tasks to more com-\nplex multimodal tasks, there is an increasing need for sim-\nilar OOD datasets that can comprehensively test the gener-\nalization abilities of LMMs.\nThere are several studies that stress test various aspects\nof vision from different angles, such as compositional and\nspatial reasoning [20, 28, 29, 67], objects placed out of con-\ntext and implausible scenes [9, 14, 84], and the exploitation\nof language and vision priors [18, 40].\nThe closest benchmark to ours is Whoops [9], which is\ndesigned to challenge commonsense knowledge and rea-\nsoning in LMMs. However, our dataset differs in several\nways: (1) The tasks in GlitchBench come from real-\nworld tasks, specifically video game quality assurance, and\nare not artificially created to test models. (2) Whoops re-\nquires cultural and background knowledge to answer; for\nexample, A panda bear is catching salmon fish is unusual\n(a) A person stuck in a piece of furniture\n(b) Two people driving an invisible car\n(c) A rifle floating in the air\n(d) A person is floating in the air\n(e) The gun in the hand is missing\n(f) The table cover has a placeholder texture\nFigure 2. Sample images from the GlitchBench showing glitches in various games with distinct styles. Samples (a)–(e) are captured\nfrom online videos, while sample (f) is generated inside the Unity game engine.\nsince pandas subsist almost entirely on bamboo. In contrast,\nour dataset contains samples that contradict basic common-\nsense and the physics of the world. (3) Finally, images in\nWhoops are synthesized using image-to-text models; they\nare clear without artifacts, centered in the image, and do not\nstress the visual side of the image, focusing on the context.\nIn contrast, for GlitchBench, models need to fully scan\nthe image to identify its unusual aspects (Fig. 2), and there\nare many distracting elements present in the image, chal-\nlenging them to focus on the correct part of the image.\n2.3. Empirical Analysis of Recent LMMs\nWith the release of recent proprietary LLMs, such as GPT-\n4V and Bard [21], some studies attempt to evaluate and\nreport the performance of these models on various bench-\nmarks and tasks [16, 54, 73]. The main goal of these stud-\nies is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the mod-\nels across various well-established tasks and some narrow\ndomains [71, 74]. The main difference between our work\nand these studies is that we propose a general, stress-testing\nbenchmark to measure the generalization power of vari-\nous LLMs, both proprietary and open source, on a specific,\nglitch-detection task in the game industry.\n3. GlitchBench\nIn this section, we describe the creation process of\nGlitchBench, a benchmark aimed at stress-testing visual\nperception and commonsense reasoning in LMMs, moti-\nvated by real-world game quality assurance tasks.\nDuring development, video games go through many\nstages of testing to reach certain quality standards before\nrelease. However, even after release, they can still exhibit\nunusual in-game events, or glitches. Glitches, often viewed\nas annoying bugs, can also possess a humorous and en-\ntertaining aspect. Players frequently report glitches across\nvarious social media platforms, particularly on Reddit and\nYouTube. A critical aspect of understanding glitches is the\nrequirement of commonsense knowledge about the basic\nlaws of physics of the game’s universe, making them a suit-\nable and practical candidate for testing machine learning\nmodels. Fig. 2 shows six samples from GlitchBench.\n3.1. Constructing the Dataset\nGlitchBench contains two parts: (1) 513 samples shared\nby players of video games, i.e., frames collected from on-\nline sources, and (2) 75 synthetic samples.\nSamples shared by players of video games:\nTo con-\nstruct our dataset, we sampled 1,000 videos from the Game-\nPhysics [66] dataset. This dataset consists of videos from a\nsubreddit with the same name, containing gameplay video\nclips with unusual events and glitches.\nNext, we conducted a manual review process to filter\nvideos based on two criteria: (1) the presence of a glitch\nin the video, and (2) the potential for humans to detect the\nglitch from a single frame. The second criterion is key be-\ncause certain glitches, such as those involving rapid shaking\nor changes in size over time, cannot be detected from a still\nimage alone.\nAfter applying these filters, we extracted one frame from\neach remaining video, resulting in a collection of 650 sam-\nples. Our final round of manual reviews revealed two poten-\ntial issues: (1) some glitches are not detectable from the ex-\ntracted image and require more context to understand, and\n(2) some images contain the faces of gamers who streamed\nthe content on an online platform (which could cause the\nLMM to identify these faces as what is wrong with the im-\nages). After removing videos that contain one of these is-\nsues, our final glitch set contains 513 images.\nGenerating synthetic samples with Unity:\nTo enhance\nour dataset, we supplemented samples from the Game-\nPhysics dataset with 75 synthetic examples created inside\nthe Unity game engine. These samples were specifically\ndesigned to mimic a subset of common development-stage\nbugs [39, 55, 65] that are not readily available in online so-\ncial media platforms and, hence, to diminish the survivor\nbias effect. These flaws are often fixed before the public\nrelease of a game through the quality assurance process of\na game development company and are therefore not often\nposted on social media.\nOur synthetic sample generation process involves the\ninjection of three categories of glitches into each scene:\n(1) placeholder textures, (2) object mesh distortions, and\n(3) low-resolution textures.\nGlitch-free images:\nOur focus is on glitch frames, as they\nare more challenging to capture and collect. However, to es-\ntablish a baseline for comparison, we also included a set\nof glitch-free images.\nTo accomplish this, we randomly\nselected gameplay walkthroughs from various games on\nYouTube. From these walkthroughs, we extracted a random\nsubset of frames, resulting in the compilation of a dataset\nconsisting of 330 frames sourced from a diverse array of\ngames. The groundtruth captions for these glitch-free im-\nages is “There is nothing wrong with this image”.\n3.2. Labeling the Dataset\nFor all images, we provide a short description of the glitch\npresent in the image. Our goal is to label the images briefly,\nhighlighting only the unusual elements in simple language.\nFor instance, if an image depicts a character with a con-\ntorted physique, the label would simply state, “character\nhas an unnatural body position”.\nIt is important to highlight that some images can be de-\nscribed in many different ways. Diverse phrases such as\n“falling from the sky”, “suspended in mid-air”, or “jump-\ning in the air” might all refer to a single event. Instead of\nhandling such cases in the labeling process, in the evalua-\ntion process, we incorporate a language model to diminish\nthe effect of this (see Sec. 4.1).\n3.3. Categorizing the Glitch Types in the Images\nIn this section, we provide a high-level categorization of\nglitches in our dataset.\nWhile there have been some at-\ntempts to provide a taxonomy of video game bugs [32, 69],\nthese taxonomies do not provide descriptions that are ade-\nquate to automate bug categorization.\nWe propose a novel human-AI team-based method to\nbuild a categorization based on the descriptions of the im-\nages. This process is a collaborative effort between GPT-4\nand humans, where GPT-4 suggests initial categories, and\nthen humans refine these suggestions by providing feed-\nback or asking the model to re-evaluate its output, harness-\ning the reflective ability of GPT-4 [61]. Finally, we man-\nually bridge the resulting categories to those proposed by\nLewis et al. [32] based on the semantics and instances of\nthe glitches in our dataset.\nProcess:\nWe prompt GPT-4 with all the glitch descrip-\ntions in our dataset and ask it to generate a categorization\nbased on the descriptions and semantics of the glitches. In\neach subsequent iteration, we provide feedback in one of\ntwo ways: (1) we ask GPT-4 to review its previous answer\nthrough reflection, or (2) we explicitly instruct the model\nto merge two categories that are semantically similar. We\nstop when the model no longer changes its answer through\nreflection or when we can no longer merge categories.\nIn the last step, to assign each image to a category, we\nprompt GPT-4 with the description of the glitch and the final\ncategories and ask it to assign each image to one of them.\nThe final categories, the number of instances, examples for\neach category, and the parent category proposed by Lewis\net al. [32] are outlined in Table 1.\n4. Experiments\n4.1. Experimental Setup\nFormulating Questions:\nWe designed GlitchBench as\na free-text response benchmark, in contrast with traditional\nLMM benchmarks that utilize Yes\/No or multiple-choice\nformats [19, 33]. We ask models to describe the unusual\naspects of an image by answering three questions:\n(Q1) What is unusual about this image?\n(Q2) What is wrong with this image?\n(Q3) Describe the image in detail\nNote that we do not explicitly use the word glitch in the\nquestion, and we use simple language similar to what a\nlayperson would use. During the inference, we allow mod-\nels to come up with their own reasoning, and after the model\ngenerates the full response, we record it for further evalua-\ntion and comparison with the ground truth.\nThe rationale for free-text answers is that including an\n‘unusual’ event description among choices hints to the\nLMM, letting it answer while disregarding visual aspects.\nTable 1. Categorization of video game glitches in GlitchBench.\nNumbers highlighted in ■show the number of images in each\ncategory. Categories highlighted in ■show the corresponding cat-\negories proposed by Lewis et al. [32].\nPhysics, Collision, and Spawn\nImages: 422\n(Non-Temporal →Invalid position)\n1.\nObjects and characters floating or stuck in the air\n(Fig. 2d).\n2.

Camera issues such as clipping inside objects or im-\nproper character views.\n2. In-game menus displaying incorrect elements.\n3. Shadows or lighting effects that do not match the envi-\nronment.\nWe included question Q3 to assess whether the mod-\nels can accurately report any glitches or unusual elements\nwithin the image in extensive captioning.\nEssentially,\nthis question serves as a visual perception test, evaluating\nwhether the models can identify and describe unusual as-\npects of the image in a more relaxed condition. For exam-\nple, in the sample shown in Fig. 1, we test the model to see\nif it can identify the presence of rain in the room. In this\ncase, it indicates that it is raining outside.\nEvaluation:\nFollowing recent successes [8, 41, 78, 82]\nwe employ a language model as a judge to evaluate the\nmodel’s responses. We use Llama-2-70B-Chat [68] to com-\npare the model-generated text with the ground truth and de-\ntermine whether the text conveys the same meaning or men-\ntions the event highlighted by the ground truth (see Fig. 3).\nWe report the accuracy of each model on each tested\nquestion and present the average performance for Q1 and\nThe image shows a car ﬂipped \nupside down in mid-air, which is \nan unusual and unrealistic \nsituation for a standard vehicle, \nsuggesting that it's either a scene \nfrom a video game or a result of \ndigital manipulation. \nGround Truth:\nA car is upside down in the \nair.\nYes\nNo\nWhat is wrong with this image?\nJudge\n (Llama-2)\nFigure 3. To evaluate a model’s response, we ask a judge (the\nLlama-2-70b-Chat model) to compare it semantically with the\nground truth.\nQ2 as the final benchmark result. Q3 serves as the visual\nperception test, and we report the performance of the mod-\nels on it separately.\nTo assess Llama-2’s judgment and determine if it can\neffectively serve as an evaluator, we manually reviewed a\nsubset of responses for each model. For each model, we\nmanually labeled 20 samples, with a total of 220 samples.\nModels:\nIn total, we evaluated 11 LMMs, including GPT-\n4V [2], and 10 open source models: LLaVA-1.5 (7B and\n13B) [42], SPHINX (7B and 13B) [38], InstructBLIP (7B\nand 13B) [17], Qwen-VL-Chat (10B) [6], MiniGPT-v2\n(7B) [11], OtterHD [34], and Fuyo (8B) [7]. We used the\ndefault temperature and top-p configurations provided with\nthe model and API. We increased max token to get full\nresponses from models. (See Sec. A1 for details).\n4.2. Quantitative Results\nTable 2 shows the performance of all the tested models for\nthe three questions. The Average performance on Q1 and\nQ2 is the main result of our benchmark. GPT-4V is the best-\nperforming model, achieving 57.2% (Q1) and 29.5% (Q2)\nand an average of 43.4%. Next, LLaVA-1.5-13B achieves\nan average of 35.5% and is the best performing open-source\nmodel. These findings show GlitchBench is challenging\nfor even state-of-the-art commercial & open-source models.\nThe performance of GPT-4V on glitch-free images is\nmuch higher than on glitch images, with an average accu-\nracy of 91.6%, which suggests that glitch-free images are\nmuch easier to handle.\nModels exhibit different performance depending on the\nquestions being asked, but all except for the SPHINX family\nshow better performance when prompted with Q1. Never-\ntheless, the gap in performance varies, with GPT-4V show-\ning the largest gap of 27.7pp (57.2% vs. 29.5%). These\nresults highlight that different prompts steer the behavior\nTable 2.

In particular, SPHINX-13B, which oper-\nates at a higher resolution than SPHINX-7B (448 × 448 vs.\n224×224), on average performs +2.9 pp (27.9% vs. 25.0%)\nbetter than the base model. Similarly, OtterHD, which em-\nploys Fuyu as the base model with enhanced flexibility and\nsupport for higher image resolutions, outperforms Fuyu on\naverage by +15.5 (24.0% vs. 8.5%).\nAsking LMMs to extensively caption the image using\nQ3 only triggers GPT-4V to produce a very verbose re-\nsponse. In many cases, GPT-4V describes many details in\nthe image and can touch upon the unusual aspects of the\nimage. In this setup, GPT-4V can achieve 64.9%, which is\nan increase of +7.7 over Q1 and +21.5 pp better than the\nbenchmark results. This gap suggests that GPT-4V can see\nmany details in the image, but it cannot easily focus on the\nunusual aspects in the frame, indicating a gap in its reason-\ning capabilities across different modalities and prompts.\nHuman evaluation:\nTable 3 shows the results of com-\nparing between Llama-2 judgments and human evaluations,\nwith the level of agreement for each model measured by\nCohen’s Kappa [15]. Cohen’s Kappa demonstrates vary-\ning levels of concordance for each model. GPT-4V (0.80),\nInstructBLIP-7B (0.83), and Qwen-VL (1.00) exhibit sub-\nstantial to perfect agreement. In contrast, OtterHD (0.50)\nhad fair agreement, and Fuyu (-0.09) shows less than chance\nagreement, suggesting significant discrepancies. Overall,\non all models except for Fuyu, we found above moderate\nagreement between Llama-2 and human judgment, while\non six models, this agreement is substantial.\nAccuracy breakdown by category of glitches:\nFig. 4\nshows the breakdown of the performance of all tested mod-\nels across the four studied glitch categories.\nGPT-4V is\nthe best-performing model across all categories, with the\nTable 3.

Overall, the Animation and Pose category consis-\ntently proves to be the most challenging. This category con-\ntains images of characters in unusual poses, distorted body\njoints, or twisted bodies (see an example in Fig. 6).\n4.3. Qualitative Observations and Analysis\nFailing to reason about unusual aspects of the image:\nWe observed that in several cases, particularly in open-\nsource models, the model reports phrases such as “the prob-\nlem with this image is that it is computer-generated” or “this\nis not an actual scene but a scene from a video game”, along\nwith similar phrases conveying the same meaning. These\nphrases suggest that, despite the model’s ability to see the\ncontent of the image, the language component of the model\ncompletely fails to reason about the content of the image.\nAnother observation is that InstructBLIP-13B often re-\nsponds with “nothing” or similar phrases and completely\nfails to reason about the image. This is the reason why\nthe smaller InstructBLIP-7B can achieve higher accuracy\non GlitchBench. (See Sec. A3.1 for samples.)\nGPT-4V struggles with faces:\nGPT-4V is the best-\nperforming model, yet it struggles with characters’ faces,\nas shown in Fig. 5. We found several issues when process-\ning glitches related to faces, and in the majority of cases,\nGPT-4V fails to detect the glitch and sometimes halluci-\nnates about characters wearing costumes (Fig. A2), where\nthere are basically no discernible facial features. On the\nother hand, smaller open-source models can sometimes de-\ntect glitches where GPT-4V fails, but they cannot describe\nthe glitch clearly. We hypothesize that this might be due to\nthe privacy features of GPT-4V, preventing it from seeing\nthe face clearly (see Sec. A3.2 for more samples).\nPoor performance in the Animation and Pose category:\nFig. 4 shows that Animation and Pose is the hardest cate-\ngory of glitches. During manual analysis, we found that\nLMMs struggle to detect unnatural body and limb config-\nurations and incorrect animations being displayed. For in-\nstance, Fig. 6 shows an example of an unnatural arm posi-\ntion for a basketball player that GPT-4V cannot detect. This\ncategory can be further divided into three subcategories:\n(1) Heavily distorted body, e.g., when a character’s body is\noverstretched or expanded; (2) Nuances in body configura-\ntion, such as contorted or twisted limbs and hands (Fig. 6);\nand (3) Characters playing animations with invisible props\n(e.g., a missing gun in the hand, as shown in Fig. 2e).\nPrevalent hallucination in open-source models:\nHallu-\ncination typically refers to situations in which the model’s\ngenerated text contains information not present in the im-\nage [16, 58, 81, 85]. We noticed that open-source models\noften hallucinate extra objects or content in the image, e.g.,\nwe found that Fuyu’s responses almost always contain hal-\nlucinations (see Sec. A3.4). The hallucination can contain\nadditional characters or entirely new objects. These extra\nelements sometimes mislead Llama-2 into accepting an in-\ncorrect response as correct (see Sec. A3.5).\nGPT-4V fails to recognize the absence of facial skin\nQuestion: What is wrong with this image?\nGround truth: The character’s face mesh is not\nrendered correctly.\nGPT-4V: The image appears to be from a video\ngame or some form of CGI (computer-generated\nimagery) with very high-quality rendering. The\ncharacters depicted are very lifelike, suggesting a\nsignificant level of detail and investment in\ngraphics. However, there’s nothing inherently\n“wrong” with the image in terms of content; it\nseems to portray a close-up moment between two\ncharacters.\nLlama-2 (Judge): No, the generated description\ndoes not accurately convey the key information and\nthemes of the ground truth. While it acknowledges\nthe high quality of the graphics and the lifelike\nnature of the characters, it does not address the\nissue of the character’s face mesh not being\nrendered correctly, which is the main focus of the\nground truth.\nFigure 5. One of the several cases in which GPT-4V fails to detect\na problem with facial features.\nDetecting some glitches requires paying attention to\nsmall details:\nDifferent glitches in our dataset require\nvarying levels of visual attention. For example, when a car\nis flying in the air (Fig. A11), it usually occupies a large\nportion of the pixels on the screen, and models can easily\npick up on such issues. This type of glitch is easier to catch,\nand GPT-4V, in particular, is very accurate at detecting it.\nSome types of glitches require close attention to detail,\nsuch as clipping issues with clothing, where parts of the\nclothes intersect with the face or body of a character. While\nGPT-4V is generally the best model for detecting clipping,\nit is still not perfect. In some cases, GPT-4V misses the\nclipping, and in other cases, it hallucinates about clipping\n(see Sec. A3.6 for samples).\nGPT-4V fails to detect unusual body configuration\nQuestion: What is unusual about this image?\nGround truth: The left hand of the basketball\nplayer is in an unusual position and is stretched\nbackward.\nGPT-4V: The image appears to be a screenshot\nfrom a basketball video game, possibly from the\nNBA 2K series. The unusual aspects of this image\ninclude: One of the players has a bright orange\nbeard that stands out from the rest. Another player\nseems to be kissing or blowing at the basketball,\nwhich is not a typical basketball move or gesture.\nThe characters and graphics look\ncomputer-generated, which indicates it’s from a\nvideo game rather than a real-life game.\nThe interface at the bottom of the image shows\nvarious controls and buttons, which further\nsuggests that it’s from a video game.\nLlama-2 (Judge): No, the generated description\ndoes not accurately convey the key information and\nthemes of the ground truth. The ground truth\nfocuses on the unusual position of the basketball\nplayer’s left hand, while the generated description\nhighlights three unusual aspects of the image, none\nof which relate to the player’s hand position.\nFigure 6. The image shows a basketball player with an unnatural,\nimpossible elbow pose. GPT-4V fails to focus on small details\nsuch as body configuration and is unable to report this issue.\n5. Discussion and Limitation\nComparing GlitchBench with other benchmarks:\nThe performance of various models across different bench-\nmarks is presented in Tab. 4. It becomes evident that GPT-\n4V shows different performance against open-source mod-\nels compared to GlitchBench. For instance, on VQAv2,\nLLaVA-1.5 and QWEN-VL score +5.8 (80.0% vs 74.2%)\nand +5.3 pp (79.5% vs 74.2%) higher than GPT-4V, respec-\ntively. However, on GlitchBench, they lag behind by -9.9\n(33.4% vs. 43.5%) and -28 pp (15.4% vs. 43.4%). The most\nTable 4.

However, their performance on\nGlitchBench, which is derived from a real-world task in\ngame quality assurance, falls significantly short of GPT-4V.\nIn other words, the performance of models in real-world\nsettings does not correlate well with existing benchmarks.\nThis discrepancy partly comes from the design choices\ntypical of LMM benchmarks, as they often opt for Yes\/No\nor multiple-choice formats [19, 33, 45].\nThese formats\nallow models to find shortcuts for scoring high without\nnecessarily generalizing well to other tasks.\nLimitation:\nWe constructed our dataset by randomly\nsampling videos and observed a prevalence of video games\nwith an open-world genre on the Reddit website. Conse-\nquently, during our sampling process, video games from\nthis genre, characterized by their distinct mechanics, were\nmore frequently represented compared to other types.\n6. Conclusion\nWe introduce GlitchBench, a new challenging bench-\nmark for evaluating multimodal models on the video game\nglitch detection task. Detecting glitches requires various\nlevels of reasoning skills, such as an understanding of the\nlaws of physics and commonsense, making it well-suited for\ntesting the generalization capabilities of large multimodal\nmodels. Comparing models’ performance on various multi-\nmodal benchmarks and GlitchBench reveals a disparity:\nHigh performance on prior benchmarks does not guarantee\nhigh performance on real-world tasks that demand extensive\nreasoning abilities. We show that GlitchBench, derived\nfrom real-world video game quality assurance, presents a\nnew challenge for the AI community and is a valuable ad-\ndition to existing multimodal benchmarks.\nAcknowledgement\nAN is supported by the NaphCare Foundation, Adobe Re-\nsearch gifts, and NSF grant no. 2145767.\n```\n\n#### 5. 学生问题\n问题1：介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」\n问题2：这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？\n问题3：这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？\n\n\n请输出论文总结\n### 输出格式（输出语言用中文）\n```\n## 💡 解答问题1 (...复述学生问题1...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (...复述学生问题2...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (...复述学生问题3...)\n...\n```\n","llm_summary_res":"## 🌟 论文解读 | GlitchBench：大型多模态模型能否检测视频游戏中的错误？\n\n## 📌 背景痛点\/本文动机\n随着大型多模态模型（LMMs）的不断发展，它们在视觉理解和推理方面的能力得到了显著提升。然而，这些模型在实际应用中的表现和局限性尚不明确。为了填补这一空白，本文提出了GlitchBench，一个基于视频游戏质量保证任务的基准测试，旨在评估LMMs在检测和解释异常事件方面的推理能力。\n\n## 🚀 核心方法\n💡 创新点1：GlitchBench数据集\nGlitchBench数据集由593个游戏中的异常和错误场景组成，涵盖了205款不同类型的游戏。每个场景都包含一个视频片段、一个代表性帧、一个简短的描述以及一个指向Reddit上相关讨论的链接。此外，数据集还包括330个无错误的图像作为对比。\n\n💡 创新点2：评估方法\n本文评估了11个最先进的LMMs，包括GPT-4V和LLaVA，在GlitchBench上的表现。评估方法包括三个问题：\n1. 这张图片有什么不寻常的地方？\n2. 这张图片有什么问题？\n3. 详细描述这张图片。\n通过比较模型生成的文本与真实标签，评估模型在检测和解释异常事件方面的能力。\n\n## 📈 实验结果\n实验结果表明，LMMs在检测违反简单物理定律的错误（如汽车在空中飞行）方面表现较好，但在检测更微妙的错误（如人体部位处于不可能的姿势）方面表现较差。GPT-4V在GlitchBench上表现最佳，准确率达到43.4%。然而，与无错误图像相比，模型在检测错误图像方面的准确率明显较低，这表明错误图像更具挑战性。\n\n## 💬 可借鉴之处\n本文提出的GlitchBench基准测试为评估LMMs在实际应用中的推理能力提供了一个有价值的工具。此外，本文的研究结果表明，LMMs在检测和解释异常事件方面仍存在局限性，需要进一步改进。","llm_summary_res_status":200,"order":10,"query_answer":"## 💡 解答问题1 (介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」)\n\n这篇论文提出的benchmark名为GlitchBench，它是一个用于测试和评估大型多模态模型（LMMs）在检测和解释视频游戏中的异常事件（即错误）方面的推理能力的基准测试。GlitchBench数据集由593个游戏中的异常和错误场景组成，涵盖了205款不同类型的游戏。每个场景都包含一个视频片段、一个代表性帧、一个简短的描述以及一个指向Reddit上相关讨论的链接。此外，数据集还包括330个无错误的图像作为对比。\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？)\n\n论文中并未明确指出运行GlitchBench所需的特定硬件配置。然而，考虑到LMMs通常需要大量的计算资源，运行这个benchmark可能需要高性能的GPU和足够的内存。至于模型训练和推理所使用的设备，论文中提到使用了11个最先进的LMMs，包括GPT-4V和LLaVA，但没有具体说明这些模型的训练和推理是在何种设备上进行的。\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？)\n\n论文中并未提及GlitchBench是否设计有奖励机制，特别是针对强化学习（RL）类模型。GlitchBench主要是一个评估LMMs在检测和解释异常事件方面的推理能力的基准测试，它通过比较模型生成的文本与真实标签来评估模型的表现。因此，它更像是一个评估工具，而不是一个训练环境，所以可能没有设计专门的奖励机制来支持RL类模型。","query_answer_status":200}

What is particularly exciting about them is\nthat they, in contrast to earlier attempts at building\nsuch systems, as surveyed by Suglia et al. (2024),\npromise to be generalist models that can be adapted\nto tasks at hand through methods that require few or\neven no data and training cost. Current methods for\nevaluating them, however, largely do not address\nthis potential, following mostly the reference-based\nevaluation paradigm and probing for reasoning and\nrecognition capabilities in static contexts.\nIn this paper, we investigate whether a re-\ncent new evaluation paradigm for text-based\n1https:\/\/openai.com\/index\/hello-gpt-4o\/\n1\n... <TASK DESCRIPTION> ...\n2\n[A←GM] Describe your image\n3\n[A→B] DESCRIPTION: Scene of a\nriver in a city, and a boat.\n4\n... <TASK DESCRIPTION> ...\n5\n[GM→B] Describe your image\n6\n[A←B]\nDESCRIPTION:\nTwo\ngiraffes in a dirt field.\n7\n[GM→B] Ask a question.\n8\n[A←B] QUESTION: Is there any\nanimal visible in your image?\n9\n[A→B] ANSWER: No, only boats.\n10\n[A←GM] Ask a question.\n11\n[A→B] QUESTION: Is there a body\nof water in your image?\n12\n.......\n13\n[GM→B] Come to a decision.\n14\n[GM←B]\nDECISION:\ndifferent\nimages.\n15\n[A←GM] Come to a decision.\n16\n[A→GM]\nDECISION:\ndifferent\nimages.\n17\n[GM|GM] SUCCESS\nFigure 1: Example dialogue from MatchIt game, be-\ntween players A (turns highlighted in purple) and B\n(orange), and a programmatic “game master” (grey).\nThe task is to identify whether A and B were given the\nsame image or not, via text interaction only. The game\nmaster scaffolds the game by prompting the players and\nrelaying information.\nmodels—game-agency-based evaluation—can be\ntransferred to the evaluation of text and image\nmodels. Specifically, we selected one of the vari-\nous frameworks that appeared last year for defin-\ning such games, clemgame (Chalamalasetti et al.,\n2023), and adapted it to evaluate multimodal mod-\narXiv:2406.14035v3  [cs.CL]  11 Dec 2024\nels. We defined three dialogue games (on reference,\nimage comparison, and navigation) that focus on\nthe ability to build a model of a situation that is\npresented as an image and, in two of them, to align\nit with a partner. We make the following observa-\ntions:\n• Current LMMs are capable of conducting situ-\nated interactions if given enough scaffolding by\nan agent framework.\n• There are significant differences in the degree\nof this ability, however, between commercial\nand open models (43 points on our 0–100 scale\nbetween the best of each kind), mirroring the sit-\nuation that text-only models were in previously\n(Beyer et al., 2024).\n• Much of the performance is driven by the ex-\ncellent deep captioning abilities of the largest\nmodels; these break down on very detailed ab-\nstract images.\n• Elementary capabilities for representing spatial\nconfigurations (or, more abstractly, graph struc-\ntures) seem to be present in the larger models.\nWe made the source code for the implemented\ngames and the extended framework publicly avail-\nable at: https:\/\/github.com\/clembench\/. The\nleaderboard of evaluated multimodal LLMs is avail-\nable here (tab Multimodal): https:\/\/clembench.\ngithub.io\/leaderboard.html.\n2\nRelated Work\nEvaluating LLMs\nFollowing traditional prac-\ntice in NLP, the first main paradigm for evalua-\ntion LLMs was what can be called reference-based\nevaluation, where a model response to a test item\nis compared to a known correct response. As a\nreaction to the rapidly increasing scores of the lat-\nest models and the saturation of existing bench-\nmarks (Wang et al., 2019), meta-benchmarks have\nbeen set up, such as HELM (Liang et al., 2022)\nand BIGbench (Srivastava et al., 2022). While\nthis method offers control over the tasks that are\ntested, a recently highlighted problem is ensuring\ntrain\/test splits in the era of extremely large (and\nintransparent) training sets (Magar and Schwartz,\n2022). Another popular method for evaluation falls\nunder what could be called the preference-based\nevaluation paradigm. This is represented by Chat-\nbot Arena (Chiang et al., 2024), which lets users\npresent queries to two models in parallel and then\nask for preferences. This has the advantage of\nhigher ecological validity as the human\/system in-\nteraction is being evaluated. However, it comes\nwith the cost of very little control over the tested\ndistribution of tasks. Finally, a newly emerging\nparadigm is game-agency-based evaluation (Cha-\nlamalasetti et al., 2023; Chan et al., 2023; Qiao\net al., 2023). In this paradigm, evaluation is framed\nas measuring the success of LLMs in conducting\ntask-oriented interactions in simple conversational\ngames. This has the advantage that it does not re-\nquire user interaction (unlike the preference-based\nparadigm) while still keeping goal orientation and\nstrategy in focus. In this paper, we want to explore\nthis paradigm for the evaluation of LMMs.\nEvaluating LMMs\nThe evaluation of the newer\nfield of Large Multimodal Models so far mostly\nremains within the reference-base evaluation\nparadigm,2 with datasets such as MME (Fu et al.,\n2023), MMBench (Liu et al., 2023), MMMU (Yue\net al., 2023), and SEED-Bench v1 (Li et al., 2023b)\nand v2 (Li et al., 2023a). These include image and\ntext pairs as test instances for various tasks such\nas question answering, reasoning, answering scien-\ntific questions, etc. VHELM(visual HELM) 3 uses\nMMMU and two other visual question answering\ndatasets (Gurari et al., 2018; Goyal et al., 2017) to\nextend the HELM framework to test multimodal\nLLMs. Our aim here is not to replace this kind of\nevaluation but rather to complement it with a fo-\ncus on different capabilities, or at least differently\nchallenged capabilities (see below).\nBefore we describe the general structure of our\ngames, we will briefly also review literature rele-\nvant to each of them separately.\nReference Games\nThe use of reference games\nwhere one player gets another to identify an item\nthrough verbal means, goes back to at least Krauss\nand Weinheimer (1964) and Lewis (1969) in lin-\nguistics and psycholinguistics, and has seen in-\ncreased use in NLP in recent years as well (Shen\net al., 2018; Haber et al., 2019; Sadler et al., 2024).\nIts attraction lies in the very clear way in which\n2Although first attempts are underway to establish attempts\nin the preference-based evaluation paradigm as well, with the\nMultimodality Chatbot Arena http:\/\/vlarena.opengvlab.\ncom. This however seems to be much less popular so far than\nits text-based counterpart.\n3Accessed in May 2024. https:\/\/crfm.stanford.edu\/\nhelm\/vhelm\/latest\/\nit brings out context dependence (a good refer-\nring expression not only describes the target ob-\nject, but also excludes distractor objects) and, es-\npecially in settings where there are repeated ref-\nerences (Sadovnik et al., 2012), partner-effects as\nwell (precedence; (Brennan and Clark, 1996)).\nImage Comparison\nThe second game that we\nimplement follows a suggestion by Schlangen\n(2019), who uses it to illustrate the concept of a\nGrounded Agreement Game. The idea here is to\ngo beyond settings like Visual Dialog (Das et al.,\n2017) or Guesswhat?! (de Vries et al., 2017), which\nwere quite popular in the language and vision field\nat the time. The criticism in this paper was that\nthese settings while eliciting dialogue in the sense\nof sequential turns from different speakers, do not\nprovide much purpose to the interaction. Grounded\nAgreement Games, on the other hand, by letting\nplayers share a common goal of reaching mutual\nunderstanding, provide a “joint purpose, a shared\nsense of semantic ownership of the interaction”\n(Schlangen, 2019). Also related, in incorporating\nvisual information and cooperation between partic-\nipants, is spot-the-difference (Lopes et al., 2018);\nthis corpus, however, has only been used for lin-\nguistic analysis.\nNavigation and Exploration\nFollowing natu-\nral language navigation instructions is a well-\nestablished task in the intersection of Computer\nVision and NLP, and many special purpose models\nhave been built in recent years (Gu et al., 2022).\nThe task described below is related but posed to\ngeneralist models, and tasks the model only with\nexploration. More abstractly, what is tested is the\nability to explore graph structures and testing spa-\ntial reasoning abilities (Shi et al., 2022; Rizvi et al.,\n2024). As a task for the assessment of models,\nsomething related has been used by Momennejad\net al. (2023) in CogEval. Their results suggest that\nLLMs lack emergent cognitive map comprehen-\nsion or planning competence, finding that LLMs\ncan navigate simple graphs but struggle with spa-\ntial relationships and complex graphs due to loop-\ning, missing edges, and longer trajectories. The\nNLGraph benchmark (Wang et al., 2023) tested\nLLMs’ ability to perform explicit graph reason-\ning on eight tasks.\nThe models perform basic\ngraph reasoning on cycle and shortest path tasks\nbut fail on the Hamilton Path, according to the\nNLGraph benchmark assessment.

This was criticized by (Liu and Wu,\n2023), who showed that responses may become\nmore error-prone when graph density exceeds a cer-\ntain threshold, potentially causing hallucinations.\nLi et al. (2024) introduced another dataset for vi-\nsual map navigation task with where commercial\nmodels (GPT-4V, Gemini) struggled with spatial\nreasoning sub-tasks.\n3\nDialogue Games as Benchmarking Tool\nConstruct Validity\nWe follow (Chalamalasetti\net al., 2023) in striving for construct validity in\nour measurements and taking inspiration from the\nmodel of (Schlangen, 2023c,a). As can be seen\nin Figure 2 (modified from Chalamalasetti et al.\n(2023)), we link the games introduced here to the\nsituation model (representing the situation in which\nthe task at hand is to be performed), multimodal\ngrounding (linking language and visual informa-\ntion), and, at least in simple forms, to conversa-\ntional grounding and the agent model. See the\noriginal papers for an explanation of the model and\nthe other components. How the individual games\nchallenge these aspects will be explained below.\nScaffolding Game Play with a GameMaster\nWe decided to use clemgame\/clembench (Chala-\nmalasetti et al., 2023) as the framework to realise\nthe idea of “self-play for evaluation”. The main\nidea of this framework is that dialogue games are\nspecified through prompt templates, which explain\nthe game goals to the players in natural language.\nThe game goals include the task description and\nspecific rules for formatting responses (so that they\ncan be parsed). A programmatic GameMaster then\nrealises the game play through the instantiation of\nthe templates with specific game instances (e.g.,\nin the game from Figure 1, an instance would be\ndefined by a given pair of images), and the turn-\nby-turn prompting of the players (which can be\nmodels or human players).\nThe resulting episodes are then scored through\ngame-specific scoring rules. For each game, one\nscoring metric is determined as the quality metric\n(always ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best)). An\noverall score is computed by averaging this met-\nric by game and then over games. Games where\na player violates the parsing rules count as not\nplayed (until the end); the percentage of games\nplayed hence can serve as a metric for formatting\ninstruction following ability, whereas the quality\nmetric measures the ability to play the respective\ngame successfully (only for those episodes that\nwere played until the end). We aggregate these two\nscores to a single number, the clemscore, as the\nquality metric weighted by % played (scaled to the\ninterval [0, 1]).\n4\nThree Multimodal Games\nIn this section, we describe the three different\ngames that we set up, with a focus on which capa-\nbilities exactly they are meant to target.\n4.1\nReference: The Reference Game\nGame Description Player A is presented with three\nimages, and tasked with getting player B, who may\nsee them in a different order, to identify the first of\nthese. Player B is then presented with the three im-\nages, potentially in a different order, together with\nA’s reference, and is tasked to identify the referent.\nThis is a single-turn game (Figure 9, 10, 6).\nCapability Tested The idea is that this game chal-\nlenges the referring model to go beyond simple de-\nscriptions of the image content towards contrastive\ndescriptions that exclude the distractor images, and\nideally also efficient descriptions that do so by\nconcentrating on distinguishing features (Gatt and\nKrahmer, 2018).\nScoring Each episode is scored as 1 if successful\n(B picks out the intended referent), 0 otherwise.\nInstances We created different sets of instances,\nwith the hypothesis that they might challenge the\nmodels differently. First, we created grid-like pixel\nimages (Figure 9), which we varied in terms of\n‘compressability’: from simple-to-recognise (for\nhumans) patterns to random placements. We cre-\nated these stimuli in two different renderings: As\ncharacter-based ‘images’ (hence suitable for text-\nonly models, to allow for a comparison in perfor-\nmance; filled cells are marked with the character\n“X”), as well as real images (converted from the\ntext representations).\nSecond, we selected sets of photographs (Fig-\nure 10) (or photo-realistic renderings) of scenes\nor configurations of objects, to contrast handling\nof more naturalistic scenes with the set of grid-\nimages. We included instances from three datasets:\nADE20K (Zhou et al., 2017), DOCCI (Onoe et al.,\n2024), CLEVR (Johnson et al., 2017). We selected\none target and two distractors chosen based on the\nsimilarity to the target (based on available meta-\ndata in each dataset; scene category information\nin ADE20K, the list of concepts in DOCCI, object\ncategories in CLEVR).\nThird, we created boards that include pentomino\npuzzle pieces (Figure 6) to analyse whether mod-\nels are capable of handling unusual shapes and\ncrowded scenes. We take code from Sadler et al.\n(2024) and generate a wide variety of scenes, in\nsets of images with very small differences. From\nthis, we sample randomly. In total, there are 13\nexperiments corresponding to 390 instances.\n4.2\nAlignment: The MatchIt Game\nGame Description Player A is presented with an\nimage, as is Player B. The two images are either\nidentical, or different. The task of the players is\nto find out which is the case. This game is heavily\nscaffolded by the GameMaster, which prompts the\nplayers to produce a description and ask a question\nof the other player (Figure 1). The dialogue con-\ntinues with question and answering rounds (where\nboth players ask and answer each other’s question)\nuntil players make a decision (SAME, DIFFER-\nENT) about the given images (or GameMaster in-\ntervenes if maximum number of rounds is reached).\nCapability Tested Our hypothesis is that good\ngameplay requires reasoning about what distin-\nguishing features could be, the presence or absence\nof which would allow for making the same\/dif-\nferent decision. This can then influence both the\ninitial description that is produced and what ques-\ntions are asked. In principle, allowing more rounds\nof mutual questioning should make the task easier.\nScoring Each episode is scored 1 (A and B both\nmake the correct determination) or 0.\nInstances Three difficulties were defined for the\nmultimodal variant of MatchIt: both players get\nthe same image, both players get similar images or\ncompletely different images, the hypothesis being\nFigure 3: A pair of similar images for MatchIt.\nFigure 4: Environment for the text-only Map game.\nThe player (denoted with P) is currently in the Nursery\nand has the option to move to one of the neighboring\nrooms (Bar, Closet or Bedroom). The player moves by\nchoosing a cardinal direction: east, west, north, south\nthat different images are the easiest to recognize,\nfollowed by same and similar image pairs. The cu-\nration rationale for a similar picture was that both\nphotos could be described with the same (short)\nsentence, but their difference should be striking\nenough that one (short) sentence should be enough.\nFigure 3 illustrates a similar image pair. The im-\nages used were taken from the Visual Genome\ndataset (Krishna et al., 2017) and sampled for the\ncategory of similar photos in a multi-step process\nvia Jaccard similarity of sets of object annotations\nand their attributes and cosine similarity of CLIP\nimage encoder embeddings (Radford et al., 2021).\nThe detailed process is described in Appendix C.\nTen instances of each difficulty (same, similar, dif-\nferent) were part of the final game play, for a total\nof 30 instances. Finally, we also sampled accord-\ningly from the set of pentomino images described\nabove in Section 4.1. In total, there are six experi-\nments corresponding to 60 instances.\n4.3\nNavigation & Exploration: Map Game\nGame Description This is a single-player game in\nwhich the player explores a network of connected\nrooms, it is based on the environment “MapWorld”\nof Ilinykh et al. (2019). At any point in the game,\nthe player is in one of the rooms of the network (or\nmap). The player can move into adjacent rooms by\nissuing a navigational command (east, west, north,\nor south) (see Figure 4). Information about the\nroom is relayed to the player by the GameMaster\nby giving the image of the room (the name of room,\ne.g. “Nursery”, is never revealed); information\nabout the directions in which adjacent rooms can\nbe found is always relayed via text (e.g. “From\nhere you can go north, south, east.”). Within this\ngeneral setting, we define several versions: Go to X\n(G2X), in which the player is tasked to find a room\nof a specific category and indicate when they think\nthe goal has been achieved. Explore Exhaustively\n(EE), in which the player is tasked with visiting\nall rooms of the map and indicate when it thinks\nthe goal has been achieved. In graph reasoning\n(EE-gr), the player is prompted to generate the\naction along with the representation of the already\nexplored graph explicitly.\nCapability Tested Unlike in the previous two\ngames, the situation relevant to the game is not\nobservable in one go but rather must be explored\nactively. To perform well in this family of games,\nan internal representation of the map must be kept.\nMoreover, to be efficient, some spatial reasoning\nover this implicit structure is required to keep track\nof as yet unexplored rooms.\nScoring Scoring is more complex in this game.\nWe define a metric for efficiency, which measures\nhow many of the performed moves were necessary\n(see Appendix D.4 for the full definition); ques-\ntion answering, which measures the percentage of\nquestions answered correctly (in the variant with\nquestions); and success, which is 1 if the player\nended the game in a success condition (indicated\nroom found \/ all rooms explored), and 0 otherwise.\nInstances Experiments on the EE version test the\neffect of map complexity by changing map size\nand connectedness. The maps can have 4, 6, or\n8 rooms, whereas, in the 6 or 8-room case, we\ndistinguish between maps with and without a cyclic\npath in them, yielding five experiments in total. We\nexpect larger and more connected maps to be harder\nto explore. For our EE-gr version, we reuse the\nthree experiments on map sizes from above. The\ngoal is to have comparable results and measure the\ninfluence of explicit graph reasoning. On the G2X\nversion, we experiment with distances from start to\ntarget, either starting on, close to, or far from the\ntarget. The hypothesis is that finding a target room\nnearby is easier than finding it far away.

We benchmarked both open-weight\nand commercial models.\nOf commercial mod-\nels, we decided to evaluate Claude-3.5-Sonnet\n(June 2024), Claude-3-Opus (February 2024),\nGPT-4-vision (November 2023), GPT-4o (May\n& August 2024 versions), GPT-4o-mini (July\n2024), and Gemini-1.5-Flash-001 (May 2024).5\nFrom the available open-weight models we se-\nlected InternVL2 (8B, 26B, 40B, 76B ver-\nsions)\n(Chen\net\nal.,\n2023),\nIdefics\n(9B,\n80B\nversions)\n(Laurençon\net\nal.,\n2023),\nIdefics-3 (8B-llama) (Laurençon et al., 2024)\nInternLM-XComposer-2.5 (Zhang et al., 2024),\nPhi-vision (3.0, 3.5 versions) (Abdin et al.,\n2024), Pixtral-12B (2409)6. We provide more\ndetails about models in Appendix A.\nThe benchmark results are given in Table 1.\nWhat first catches the eye is the significant differ-\nence in overall score (clemscore) between closed-\n4https:\/\/huggingface.co\/docs\/transformers\/en\/\nchat_templating\n5We excluded Gemini 1.5 Pro because querying the API\nbackend resulted in many experiments being timed out, and\nGemini 1.0 Pro was excluded since it does not support multi-\nturn dialogue.\n6https:\/\/huggingface.co\/mistralai\/\nPixtral-12B-2409\nweight \/ commercial and open-weight models, with\nthe best open model trailing the worst commercial\nfor 10 points and the best commercial one for 43\npoints. We can compare this to the situation with\ntext-only games, where Beyer et al. (2024) report\nthat the best\/best distance was 55.25 points in June\n2023, 41.18 five months later (November 2023),\nand in May 2024 was reduced to 24.94. This nicely\nreflects the somewhat less mature state of LMMs\n(large multimodal models) compared to LLMs.\nWhat is also striking is that % played (p), which\nmeasures the ability of the models to follow for-\nmatting instructions, is generally high; indicating\nthat the scaffolding offered by the GameMaster was\nstrong, but also perhaps that indeed these models\nare well tuned. We can also see that, in particu-\nlar, the performance on the Reference Game seems\nto be a differentiator between models; while the\ncommercial models are all in the same level on\nMatchIt, they differ more there (and to a lesser\ndegree also on the Map Navigation Games). Over-\nall, the Claude-3.5-sonnet and GPT-4o (Aug),\nwhich increased 10 points compared to the May\n2024 version, are the best performing commercial\nmodels, and the InternVL2 models are the best\nperforming open-weight models.\nTo investigate further, we turn to a more fine-\ngrained analysis by implementing text-only vari-\nants of games.\n5.2\nTextual vs. Multimodal Performance\nThis section analyses the effect of moving from\ntext-only LLMs to multimodal ones.

Green values\nindicate better textual and red values (negative) indicate\nbetter multimodal performance. The values closer to\nzero (in yellow) indicate that the performance of models\nare somewhat equal between modality variants.\nhas been implemented where inputs are represented\nin only text. For the Reference game, we ran the\noriginal ASCII character representation of grids (as\nin clembench (Chalamalasetti et al., 2023)). For the\nMatchit game, we used the same ASCII grids (Fig-\nure 12) to create similar\/dissimilar experiments.\nFor the Map Navigation game, we implemented\nall three versions in text-only variants as follows:\nonce the Player makes a move, the GameMaster\nprovides information about the current room in\ntext format, such as “You have entered Nursery.\nFrom here you can go north, south, east”. In the\nmultimodal version, this information is given as the\ninput image (e.g. Nursery) and then the text “From\nhere you can go north, south, east” (without any\ninformation about the room in text form).\nNext, we ran the benchmark on the models us-\ning textual versions of games and compared them\nagainst the multimodal results. Figure 5 shows the\ndifference in clemscore between textual and multi-\nmodal scores, where we subtracted the multimodal\nvalue from textual one. Higher values (in green) in-\ndicate that models are better at textual, while lower\nvalues (in red) stand for better performance at multi-\nmodal games. In general, we can observe that most\nmodels are better at textual games; which perhaps\ncan be explained by the dominance of text data in\ntraining datasets over other modalities (images in\nthis case) (He et al., 2024). The commercial mod-\nels such as GPT-4o (Aug’24) and Claude-3.5 (be-\ning the best two models in multimodal games) are\nalso better at textual versions of the games while\nGPT-4-1106 is worse at the textual version of the\nReference game. From the open-weight models,\nInternVL2-26B has the best score in multimodal\ngames but clearly struggled with a textual version\nof the MatchIt game. We can also observe that\nInternVL2-40B is a better choice over 26B ver-\nsion (or any other open-weight model) as its perfor-\nmance is equally distributed across games for their\ntextual and multimodal versions. The Map Nav-\nigation Game has steady performance of almost\nall models (except Idefics-80B) being better at\ntextual variants than multimodal ones.\n5.3\nZooming in on the Games\nIn this section, we discuss the individual findings\nacross games by mentioning the hypothesis (H) and\nthe finding (F).\n5.3.1\nThe MatchIt Game\nThe results breakdown in detail is in Appendix C.\nH: Pairs of similar images pose the biggest chal-\nlenge (shown for human players in a similar setting\nby Sagi et al. (2012)).\nF: Figure 14 shows that this bears out for the\nimage-based instances. This is less clear for the\ntext-based instances.\nH: Pairs of very different images will be the\neasiest to recognize (as being different) because\nthe initial description might already make clear the\nincompatibility.\nF: This has not been shown. Although for the\ntext-based game variant, the highest scores have\nbeen achieved in with different grids, the differ-\nence to same grids is not significant. Through all\nversions of multimodal inputs, the highest scores\nare achieved in the “same image” case. This fur-\nther indicates that the followed strategy relies on\ncomparative reasoning to a lesser degree than an-\nticipated.\n5.3.2\nThe Reference Game\nSee Appendix B for detailed analysis.\nH: Due to naming difficulties, the task is\nharder for more abstract images (grids, pentomino\npieces) than photos of common scenes (ADE20K,\nDOCCI).\nF: Table 4 includes detailed results for each in-\ndividual experiment.

The example on the left has the\ntarget in the first position for Player A while the right example has in the third position. The order of images for the\nPlayer B is shuffled.\npentomino experiments. The pentomino experi-\nment results (bad across the board) show that the\ntask is far from being solved. We speculate that\nthis set might touch the limits of the vision en-\ncoder and its ability to distinguish objects (of usual\nkinds). See Figures 6 for sample outputs for the\nPentomino experiment. (see Figure 9 and 10 for\nADE, CLEVER experiments).\nH: Random images are more challenging to de-\nscribe than patterns and objects.\nF: Indeed, the results in Table 4 show that most\nmodels struggled with random grids for both tex-\ntual and multimodal variants of the game. The\nsame difference can be observed for photo images\nvs. random collections of pentomino pieces.\nH: Given that the base models from which the\nmodels were trained are text models, even the re-\nsulting models perform better on the text-only ren-\nderings of grid experiments than the image ones.\nF: Results are mixed. Some models are better\nat ASCII representations (Gemini-1.5, GPT-4o),\nwhile others are better at multimodal representa-\ntions (Claude-3, GPT-4V). See Figures 9 and 11\nfor sample outputs.\nH: To reach high scores in this game, player\nA needs to do Referring Expression Generation\n(REG; Gatt and Krahmer (2018)), as opposed to\ncaptioning.\nF: We were initially surprised by the high scores\nachieved, in particular by the GPT-4s. On inspect-\ning the transcripts, it became clear that the model\nachieves its high performance in parts through its\nexceptional ability to produce detailed descriptions\n(especially for the photo sets), thereby reaching a\nlevel of detail where a description of the target itself\nis enough to single it out (see also Appendix B.4\nfor an ablation on the (missing) effect of the distrac-\ntors). This is also evident from the average number\nof generated tokens, which is 27 for GPT-4V and\n20 for GPT-4o, as compared to 14 for Gemini and\nClaude. We also find little evidence for the use of\nnegations (“the one without cars”), which can be an\nefficient REG strategy (although Claude does pro-\nduce this occasionally). As mentioned above, per-\nformance breaks down for the pentomino dataset.\nOverall, this suggests that the game, as currently\ndefined, leans more towards evaluating deep cap-\ntioning (where there is still room to grow).\n5.3.3\nThe Map Navigation Games\nAs can be seen in Table 1 above, of the three\ngames, performance is lowest on the Map Naviga-\ntion Games, showing an especially pronounced gap\nbetween the commercial and the open-weight mod-\nels, which are only able to finish a much smaller\npercentage of games (% played). A detailed re-\nsults breakdown is in Appendix D.

The currently visited\nroom is marked as cyan, rooms that have been visited are olive colored and the gray rooms have not been visited yet.\nThe game is Played when a model decides to stop on its own by generating “DONE”. The game is Aborted if a\nmodel generates an output that does not comply with formatting or if the number of turns reaches the maximum\nlimit of 20. The number of visited nodes and total steps are also given for each model.\nalso given in Figure 7, which shows how open-\naccess models (InternVL2-26B, Idefics-80B) reach\nthe maximum turn limit because they enter a loop.\nH: A larger map makes exhaustive exploration\nmore difficult. There is a higher chance of missing\nsomething if there are more things to discover.\nF: Holds true for smaller models. Looking at\nthe results in Table 11, a slight downward trend\nis noticeable. However, some models appear to\nbe behaving differently, showing better results on\nmedium or larger maps compared to small maps.\nThis is likely due to their thoroughness when it\ncomes to exploration. Models make more steps\nthan the number of nodes in the map, e.g. GPTs\ntend to take more redundant steps. The ratio of re-\ndundant exploration to useful exploration decreases\nwith larger map sizes, leading to higher scores.\nH: A more complex map layout (w\/ cycles) is\nharder to navigate.\nF: Table 11 seem to indicate that this holds true.\nWhile there is only a marginal difference between\nmaps of medium size with and without cycles, the\ndifference becomes more apparent with large maps.\nH: In G2X (go to specific room), the further away\nfrom the starting position the target is, the harder it\nis to identify it, as more exploration is needed and\ndistractor categories might be encountered.\nF: The results in Table 14 show a clear correla-\ntion between distance and success. Not a single\nmodel could accurately find every target room at a\ndistance of three or more.\nOverall, we take these findings as an indication\nthat the game posed a significant challenge to the\nmodels, and that successful completion requires\nsophisticated representational and spatial reasoning\nabilities.\n6\nConclusions\nWe have transferred a recent evaluation paradigm—\ngame-based evaluation—from the text-only do-\nmain to the evaluation of multimodal models. We\nhave set up a set of games that challenge, in differ-\nent ways, mostly a model’s capability to represent\n(and describe) a situation. We have systematically\nvaried the complexity of these situations, as well\nas how they are given to the model (where we have\nincluded, for comparison, purely text-based render-\nings). We argue that the results on the benchmark\nare a valid measurement of (aspects of) specific\nunderlying capabilities, which static benchmarks\ndo not address. We observe a large difference in\nperformance between the largest commercial mod-\nels and the smaller open-weight models, albeit to\na smaller degree than other researchers have ob-\nserved in the early stages of text-only models. The\nbenchmarks indicate that there is room to grow\nboth for the closed and the open models, while\nthere already is a basis for the development of new\nkinds of situated interactive systems.\nAcknowledgments\nThe work reported here has been partially funded\nby the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG,\nGerman Research Foundation), grants 423217434\n(“RECOLAGE”) and 317633480 (SFB 1287); and\nby Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung\n(BMBF, German Federal Ministry of Research),\nproject \"COCOBOTS\" (01IS21102A). We thank\nthe anonymous reviewers for their helpful feed-\nback.\nLimitations\nThe first and biggest limitation is that the prompts\nthat define the games are only given in, and hence\nthe results are restricted to, English, even though\nseveral of the tested models are listed as being\nable to process other languages as well. While we\nhave yet to do this, translating the prompts and\nmeasuring their impact should be straightforward;\nwe plan to do this in future work.\nAs discussed in the text above, some of the find-\nings are limited to certain respect by the fact that\nexcellent capabilities of providing image captions\nopen up simpler strategies than what we initially\nwanted to challenge.

What is particularly exciting about them is\nthat they, in contrast to earlier attempts at building\nsuch systems, as surveyed by Suglia et al. (2024),\npromise to be generalist models that can be adapted\nto tasks at hand through methods that require few or\neven no data and training cost. Current methods for\nevaluating them, however, largely do not address\nthis potential, following mostly the reference-based\nevaluation paradigm and probing for reasoning and\nrecognition capabilities in static contexts.\nIn this paper, we investigate whether a re-\ncent new evaluation paradigm for text-based\n1https:\/\/openai.com\/index\/hello-gpt-4o\/\n1\n... <TASK DESCRIPTION> ...\n2\n[A←GM] Describe your image\n3\n[A→B] DESCRIPTION: Scene of a\nriver in a city, and a boat.\n4\n... <TASK DESCRIPTION> ...\n5\n[GM→B] Describe your image\n6\n[A←B]\nDESCRIPTION:\nTwo\ngiraffes in a dirt field.\n7\n[GM→B] Ask a question.\n8\n[A←B] QUESTION: Is there any\nanimal visible in your image?\n9\n[A→B] ANSWER: No, only boats.\n10\n[A←GM] Ask a question.\n11\n[A→B] QUESTION: Is there a body\nof water in your image?\n12\n.......\n13\n[GM→B] Come to a decision.\n14\n[GM←B]\nDECISION:\ndifferent\nimages.\n15\n[A←GM] Come to a decision.\n16\n[A→GM]\nDECISION:\ndifferent\nimages.\n17\n[GM|GM] SUCCESS\nFigure 1: Example dialogue from MatchIt game, be-\ntween players A (turns highlighted in purple) and B\n(orange), and a programmatic “game master” (grey).\nThe task is to identify whether A and B were given the\nsame image or not, via text interaction only. The game\nmaster scaffolds the game by prompting the players and\nrelaying information.\nmodels—game-agency-based evaluation—can be\ntransferred to the evaluation of text and image\nmodels. Specifically, we selected one of the vari-\nous frameworks that appeared last year for defin-\ning such games, clemgame (Chalamalasetti et al.,\n2023), and adapted it to evaluate multimodal mod-\narXiv:2406.14035v3  [cs.CL]  11 Dec 2024\nels. We defined three dialogue games (on reference,\nimage comparison, and navigation) that focus on\nthe ability to build a model of a situation that is\npresented as an image and, in two of them, to align\nit with a partner. We make the following observa-\ntions:\n• Current LMMs are capable of conducting situ-\nated interactions if given enough scaffolding by\nan agent framework.\n• There are significant differences in the degree\nof this ability, however, between commercial\nand open models (43 points on our 0–100 scale\nbetween the best of each kind), mirroring the sit-\nuation that text-only models were in previously\n(Beyer et al., 2024).\n• Much of the performance is driven by the ex-\ncellent deep captioning abilities of the largest\nmodels; these break down on very detailed ab-\nstract images.\n• Elementary capabilities for representing spatial\nconfigurations (or, more abstractly, graph struc-\ntures) seem to be present in the larger models.\nWe made the source code for the implemented\ngames and the extended framework publicly avail-\nable at: https:\/\/github.com\/clembench\/. The\nleaderboard of evaluated multimodal LLMs is avail-\nable here (tab Multimodal): https:\/\/clembench.\ngithub.io\/leaderboard.html.\n2\nRelated Work\nEvaluating LLMs\nFollowing traditional prac-\ntice in NLP, the first main paradigm for evalua-\ntion LLMs was what can be called reference-based\nevaluation, where a model response to a test item\nis compared to a known correct response. As a\nreaction to the rapidly increasing scores of the lat-\nest models and the saturation of existing bench-\nmarks (Wang et al., 2019), meta-benchmarks have\nbeen set up, such as HELM (Liang et al., 2022)\nand BIGbench (Srivastava et al., 2022). While\nthis method offers control over the tasks that are\ntested, a recently highlighted problem is ensuring\ntrain\/test splits in the era of extremely large (and\nintransparent) training sets (Magar and Schwartz,\n2022). Another popular method for evaluation falls\nunder what could be called the preference-based\nevaluation paradigm. This is represented by Chat-\nbot Arena (Chiang et al., 2024), which lets users\npresent queries to two models in parallel and then\nask for preferences. This has the advantage of\nhigher ecological validity as the human\/system in-\nteraction is being evaluated. However, it comes\nwith the cost of very little control over the tested\ndistribution of tasks. Finally, a newly emerging\nparadigm is game-agency-based evaluation (Cha-\nlamalasetti et al., 2023; Chan et al., 2023; Qiao\net al., 2023). In this paradigm, evaluation is framed\nas measuring the success of LLMs in conducting\ntask-oriented interactions in simple conversational\ngames. This has the advantage that it does not re-\nquire user interaction (unlike the preference-based\nparadigm) while still keeping goal orientation and\nstrategy in focus. In this paper, we want to explore\nthis paradigm for the evaluation of LMMs.\nEvaluating LMMs\nThe evaluation of the newer\nfield of Large Multimodal Models so far mostly\nremains within the reference-base evaluation\nparadigm,2 with datasets such as MME (Fu et al.,\n2023), MMBench (Liu et al., 2023), MMMU (Yue\net al., 2023), and SEED-Bench v1 (Li et al., 2023b)\nand v2 (Li et al., 2023a). These include image and\ntext pairs as test instances for various tasks such\nas question answering, reasoning, answering scien-\ntific questions, etc. VHELM(visual HELM) 3 uses\nMMMU and two other visual question answering\ndatasets (Gurari et al., 2018; Goyal et al., 2017) to\nextend the HELM framework to test multimodal\nLLMs. Our aim here is not to replace this kind of\nevaluation but rather to complement it with a fo-\ncus on different capabilities, or at least differently\nchallenged capabilities (see below).\nBefore we describe the general structure of our\ngames, we will briefly also review literature rele-\nvant to each of them separately.\nReference Games\nThe use of reference games\nwhere one player gets another to identify an item\nthrough verbal means, goes back to at least Krauss\nand Weinheimer (1964) and Lewis (1969) in lin-\nguistics and psycholinguistics, and has seen in-\ncreased use in NLP in recent years as well (Shen\net al., 2018; Haber et al., 2019; Sadler et al., 2024).\nIts attraction lies in the very clear way in which\n2Although first attempts are underway to establish attempts\nin the preference-based evaluation paradigm as well, with the\nMultimodality Chatbot Arena http:\/\/vlarena.opengvlab.\ncom. This however seems to be much less popular so far than\nits text-based counterpart.\n3Accessed in May 2024. https:\/\/crfm.stanford.edu\/\nhelm\/vhelm\/latest\/\nit brings out context dependence (a good refer-\nring expression not only describes the target ob-\nject, but also excludes distractor objects) and, es-\npecially in settings where there are repeated ref-\nerences (Sadovnik et al., 2012), partner-effects as\nwell (precedence; (Brennan and Clark, 1996)).\nImage Comparison\nThe second game that we\nimplement follows a suggestion by Schlangen\n(2019), who uses it to illustrate the concept of a\nGrounded Agreement Game. The idea here is to\ngo beyond settings like Visual Dialog (Das et al.,\n2017) or Guesswhat?! (de Vries et al., 2017), which\nwere quite popular in the language and vision field\nat the time. The criticism in this paper was that\nthese settings while eliciting dialogue in the sense\nof sequential turns from different speakers, do not\nprovide much purpose to the interaction. Grounded\nAgreement Games, on the other hand, by letting\nplayers share a common goal of reaching mutual\nunderstanding, provide a “joint purpose, a shared\nsense of semantic ownership of the interaction”\n(Schlangen, 2019). Also related, in incorporating\nvisual information and cooperation between partic-\nipants, is spot-the-difference (Lopes et al., 2018);\nthis corpus, however, has only been used for lin-\nguistic analysis.\nNavigation and Exploration\nFollowing natu-\nral language navigation instructions is a well-\nestablished task in the intersection of Computer\nVision and NLP, and many special purpose models\nhave been built in recent years (Gu et al., 2022).\nThe task described below is related but posed to\ngeneralist models, and tasks the model only with\nexploration. More abstractly, what is tested is the\nability to explore graph structures and testing spa-\ntial reasoning abilities (Shi et al., 2022; Rizvi et al.,\n2024). As a task for the assessment of models,\nsomething related has been used by Momennejad\net al. (2023) in CogEval. Their results suggest that\nLLMs lack emergent cognitive map comprehen-\nsion or planning competence, finding that LLMs\ncan navigate simple graphs but struggle with spa-\ntial relationships and complex graphs due to loop-\ning, missing edges, and longer trajectories. The\nNLGraph benchmark (Wang et al., 2023) tested\nLLMs’ ability to perform explicit graph reason-\ning on eight tasks.\nThe models perform basic\ngraph reasoning on cycle and shortest path tasks\nbut fail on the Hamilton Path, according to the\nNLGraph benchmark assessment.

This was criticized by (Liu and Wu,\n2023), who showed that responses may become\nmore error-prone when graph density exceeds a cer-\ntain threshold, potentially causing hallucinations.\nLi et al. (2024) introduced another dataset for vi-\nsual map navigation task with where commercial\nmodels (GPT-4V, Gemini) struggled with spatial\nreasoning sub-tasks.\n3\nDialogue Games as Benchmarking Tool\nConstruct Validity\nWe follow (Chalamalasetti\net al., 2023) in striving for construct validity in\nour measurements and taking inspiration from the\nmodel of (Schlangen, 2023c,a). As can be seen\nin Figure 2 (modified from Chalamalasetti et al.\n(2023)), we link the games introduced here to the\nsituation model (representing the situation in which\nthe task at hand is to be performed), multimodal\ngrounding (linking language and visual informa-\ntion), and, at least in simple forms, to conversa-\ntional grounding and the agent model. See the\noriginal papers for an explanation of the model and\nthe other components. How the individual games\nchallenge these aspects will be explained below.\nScaffolding Game Play with a GameMaster\nWe decided to use clemgame\/clembench (Chala-\nmalasetti et al., 2023) as the framework to realise\nthe idea of “self-play for evaluation”. The main\nidea of this framework is that dialogue games are\nspecified through prompt templates, which explain\nthe game goals to the players in natural language.\nThe game goals include the task description and\nspecific rules for formatting responses (so that they\ncan be parsed). A programmatic GameMaster then\nrealises the game play through the instantiation of\nthe templates with specific game instances (e.g.,\nin the game from Figure 1, an instance would be\ndefined by a given pair of images), and the turn-\nby-turn prompting of the players (which can be\nmodels or human players).\nThe resulting episodes are then scored through\ngame-specific scoring rules. For each game, one\nscoring metric is determined as the quality metric\n(always ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best)). An\noverall score is computed by averaging this met-\nric by game and then over games. Games where\na player violates the parsing rules count as not\nplayed (until the end); the percentage of games\nplayed hence can serve as a metric for formatting\ninstruction following ability, whereas the quality\nmetric measures the ability to play the respective\ngame successfully (only for those episodes that\nwere played until the end). We aggregate these two\nscores to a single number, the clemscore, as the\nquality metric weighted by % played (scaled to the\ninterval [0, 1]).\n4\nThree Multimodal Games\nIn this section, we describe the three different\ngames that we set up, with a focus on which capa-\nbilities exactly they are meant to target.\n4.1\nReference: The Reference Game\nGame Description Player A is presented with three\nimages, and tasked with getting player B, who may\nsee them in a different order, to identify the first of\nthese. Player B is then presented with the three im-\nages, potentially in a different order, together with\nA’s reference, and is tasked to identify the referent.\nThis is a single-turn game (Figure 9, 10, 6).\nCapability Tested The idea is that this game chal-\nlenges the referring model to go beyond simple de-\nscriptions of the image content towards contrastive\ndescriptions that exclude the distractor images, and\nideally also efficient descriptions that do so by\nconcentrating on distinguishing features (Gatt and\nKrahmer, 2018).\nScoring Each episode is scored as 1 if successful\n(B picks out the intended referent), 0 otherwise.\nInstances We created different sets of instances,\nwith the hypothesis that they might challenge the\nmodels differently. First, we created grid-like pixel\nimages (Figure 9), which we varied in terms of\n‘compressability’: from simple-to-recognise (for\nhumans) patterns to random placements. We cre-\nated these stimuli in two different renderings: As\ncharacter-based ‘images’ (hence suitable for text-\nonly models, to allow for a comparison in perfor-\nmance; filled cells are marked with the character\n“X”), as well as real images (converted from the\ntext representations).\nSecond, we selected sets of photographs (Fig-\nure 10) (or photo-realistic renderings) of scenes\nor configurations of objects, to contrast handling\nof more naturalistic scenes with the set of grid-\nimages. We included instances from three datasets:\nADE20K (Zhou et al., 2017), DOCCI (Onoe et al.,\n2024), CLEVR (Johnson et al., 2017). We selected\none target and two distractors chosen based on the\nsimilarity to the target (based on available meta-\ndata in each dataset; scene category information\nin ADE20K, the list of concepts in DOCCI, object\ncategories in CLEVR).\nThird, we created boards that include pentomino\npuzzle pieces (Figure 6) to analyse whether mod-\nels are capable of handling unusual shapes and\ncrowded scenes. We take code from Sadler et al.\n(2024) and generate a wide variety of scenes, in\nsets of images with very small differences. From\nthis, we sample randomly. In total, there are 13\nexperiments corresponding to 390 instances.\n4.2\nAlignment: The MatchIt Game\nGame Description Player A is presented with an\nimage, as is Player B. The two images are either\nidentical, or different. The task of the players is\nto find out which is the case. This game is heavily\nscaffolded by the GameMaster, which prompts the\nplayers to produce a description and ask a question\nof the other player (Figure 1). The dialogue con-\ntinues with question and answering rounds (where\nboth players ask and answer each other’s question)\nuntil players make a decision (SAME, DIFFER-\nENT) about the given images (or GameMaster in-\ntervenes if maximum number of rounds is reached).\nCapability Tested Our hypothesis is that good\ngameplay requires reasoning about what distin-\nguishing features could be, the presence or absence\nof which would allow for making the same\/dif-\nferent decision. This can then influence both the\ninitial description that is produced and what ques-\ntions are asked. In principle, allowing more rounds\nof mutual questioning should make the task easier.\nScoring Each episode is scored 1 (A and B both\nmake the correct determination) or 0.\nInstances Three difficulties were defined for the\nmultimodal variant of MatchIt: both players get\nthe same image, both players get similar images or\ncompletely different images, the hypothesis being\nFigure 3: A pair of similar images for MatchIt.\nFigure 4: Environment for the text-only Map game.\nThe player (denoted with P) is currently in the Nursery\nand has the option to move to one of the neighboring\nrooms (Bar, Closet or Bedroom). The player moves by\nchoosing a cardinal direction: east, west, north, south\nthat different images are the easiest to recognize,\nfollowed by same and similar image pairs. The cu-\nration rationale for a similar picture was that both\nphotos could be described with the same (short)\nsentence, but their difference should be striking\nenough that one (short) sentence should be enough.\nFigure 3 illustrates a similar image pair. The im-\nages used were taken from the Visual Genome\ndataset (Krishna et al., 2017) and sampled for the\ncategory of similar photos in a multi-step process\nvia Jaccard similarity of sets of object annotations\nand their attributes and cosine similarity of CLIP\nimage encoder embeddings (Radford et al., 2021).\nThe detailed process is described in Appendix C.\nTen instances of each difficulty (same, similar, dif-\nferent) were part of the final game play, for a total\nof 30 instances. Finally, we also sampled accord-\ningly from the set of pentomino images described\nabove in Section 4.1. In total, there are six experi-\nments corresponding to 60 instances.\n4.3\nNavigation & Exploration: Map Game\nGame Description This is a single-player game in\nwhich the player explores a network of connected\nrooms, it is based on the environment “MapWorld”\nof Ilinykh et al. (2019). At any point in the game,\nthe player is in one of the rooms of the network (or\nmap). The player can move into adjacent rooms by\nissuing a navigational command (east, west, north,\nor south) (see Figure 4). Information about the\nroom is relayed to the player by the GameMaster\nby giving the image of the room (the name of room,\ne.g. “Nursery”, is never revealed); information\nabout the directions in which adjacent rooms can\nbe found is always relayed via text (e.g. “From\nhere you can go north, south, east.”). Within this\ngeneral setting, we define several versions: Go to X\n(G2X), in which the player is tasked to find a room\nof a specific category and indicate when they think\nthe goal has been achieved. Explore Exhaustively\n(EE), in which the player is tasked with visiting\nall rooms of the map and indicate when it thinks\nthe goal has been achieved. In graph reasoning\n(EE-gr), the player is prompted to generate the\naction along with the representation of the already\nexplored graph explicitly.\nCapability Tested Unlike in the previous two\ngames, the situation relevant to the game is not\nobservable in one go but rather must be explored\nactively. To perform well in this family of games,\nan internal representation of the map must be kept.\nMoreover, to be efficient, some spatial reasoning\nover this implicit structure is required to keep track\nof as yet unexplored rooms.\nScoring Scoring is more complex in this game.\nWe define a metric for efficiency, which measures\nhow many of the performed moves were necessary\n(see Appendix D.4 for the full definition); ques-\ntion answering, which measures the percentage of\nquestions answered correctly (in the variant with\nquestions); and success, which is 1 if the player\nended the game in a success condition (indicated\nroom found \/ all rooms explored), and 0 otherwise.\nInstances Experiments on the EE version test the\neffect of map complexity by changing map size\nand connectedness. The maps can have 4, 6, or\n8 rooms, whereas, in the 6 or 8-room case, we\ndistinguish between maps with and without a cyclic\npath in them, yielding five experiments in total. We\nexpect larger and more connected maps to be harder\nto explore. For our EE-gr version, we reuse the\nthree experiments on map sizes from above. The\ngoal is to have comparable results and measure the\ninfluence of explicit graph reasoning.

We benchmarked both open-weight\nand commercial models.\nOf commercial mod-\nels, we decided to evaluate Claude-3.5-Sonnet\n(June 2024), Claude-3-Opus (February 2024),\nGPT-4-vision (November 2023), GPT-4o (May\n& August 2024 versions), GPT-4o-mini (July\n2024), and Gemini-1.5-Flash-001 (May 2024).5\nFrom the available open-weight models we se-\nlected InternVL2 (8B, 26B, 40B, 76B ver-\nsions)\n(Chen\net\nal.,\n2023),\nIdefics\n(9B,\n80B\nversions)\n(Laurençon\net\nal.,\n2023),\nIdefics-3 (8B-llama) (Laurençon et al., 2024)\nInternLM-XComposer-2.5 (Zhang et al., 2024),\nPhi-vision (3.0, 3.5 versions) (Abdin et al.,\n2024), Pixtral-12B (2409)6. We provide more\ndetails about models in Appendix A.\nThe benchmark results are given in Table 1.\nWhat first catches the eye is the significant differ-\nence in overall score (clemscore) between closed-\n4https:\/\/huggingface.co\/docs\/transformers\/en\/\nchat_templating\n5We excluded Gemini 1.5 Pro because querying the API\nbackend resulted in many experiments being timed out, and\nGemini 1.0 Pro was excluded since it does not support multi-\nturn dialogue.\n6https:\/\/huggingface.co\/mistralai\/\nPixtral-12B-2409\nweight \/ commercial and open-weight models, with\nthe best open model trailing the worst commercial\nfor 10 points and the best commercial one for 43\npoints. We can compare this to the situation with\ntext-only games, where Beyer et al. (2024) report\nthat the best\/best distance was 55.25 points in June\n2023, 41.18 five months later (November 2023),\nand in May 2024 was reduced to 24.94. This nicely\nreflects the somewhat less mature state of LMMs\n(large multimodal models) compared to LLMs.\nWhat is also striking is that % played (p), which\nmeasures the ability of the models to follow for-\nmatting instructions, is generally high; indicating\nthat the scaffolding offered by the GameMaster was\nstrong, but also perhaps that indeed these models\nare well tuned. We can also see that, in particu-\nlar, the performance on the Reference Game seems\nto be a differentiator between models; while the\ncommercial models are all in the same level on\nMatchIt, they differ more there (and to a lesser\ndegree also on the Map Navigation Games). Over-\nall, the Claude-3.5-sonnet and GPT-4o (Aug),\nwhich increased 10 points compared to the May\n2024 version, are the best performing commercial\nmodels, and the InternVL2 models are the best\nperforming open-weight models.\nTo investigate further, we turn to a more fine-\ngrained analysis by implementing text-only vari-\nants of games.\n5.2\nTextual vs. Multimodal Performance\nThis section analyses the effect of moving from\ntext-only LLMs to multimodal ones.

Green values\nindicate better textual and red values (negative) indicate\nbetter multimodal performance. The values closer to\nzero (in yellow) indicate that the performance of models\nare somewhat equal between modality variants.\nhas been implemented where inputs are represented\nin only text. For the Reference game, we ran the\noriginal ASCII character representation of grids (as\nin clembench (Chalamalasetti et al., 2023)). For the\nMatchit game, we used the same ASCII grids (Fig-\nure 12) to create similar\/dissimilar experiments.\nFor the Map Navigation game, we implemented\nall three versions in text-only variants as follows:\nonce the Player makes a move, the GameMaster\nprovides information about the current room in\ntext format, such as “You have entered Nursery.\nFrom here you can go north, south, east”. In the\nmultimodal version, this information is given as the\ninput image (e.g. Nursery) and then the text “From\nhere you can go north, south, east” (without any\ninformation about the room in text form).\nNext, we ran the benchmark on the models us-\ning textual versions of games and compared them\nagainst the multimodal results. Figure 5 shows the\ndifference in clemscore between textual and multi-\nmodal scores, where we subtracted the multimodal\nvalue from textual one. Higher values (in green) in-\ndicate that models are better at textual, while lower\nvalues (in red) stand for better performance at multi-\nmodal games. In general, we can observe that most\nmodels are better at textual games; which perhaps\ncan be explained by the dominance of text data in\ntraining datasets over other modalities (images in\nthis case) (He et al., 2024). The commercial mod-\nels such as GPT-4o (Aug’24) and Claude-3.5 (be-\ning the best two models in multimodal games) are\nalso better at textual versions of the games while\nGPT-4-1106 is worse at the textual version of the\nReference game. From the open-weight models,\nInternVL2-26B has the best score in multimodal\ngames but clearly struggled with a textual version\nof the MatchIt game. We can also observe that\nInternVL2-40B is a better choice over 26B ver-\nsion (or any other open-weight model) as its perfor-\nmance is equally distributed across games for their\ntextual and multimodal versions. The Map Nav-\nigation Game has steady performance of almost\nall models (except Idefics-80B) being better at\ntextual variants than multimodal ones.\n5.3\nZooming in on the Games\nIn this section, we discuss the individual findings\nacross games by mentioning the hypothesis (H) and\nthe finding (F).\n5.3.1\nThe MatchIt Game\nThe results breakdown in detail is in Appendix C.\nH: Pairs of similar images pose the biggest chal-\nlenge (shown for human players in a similar setting\nby Sagi et al. (2012)).\nF: Figure 14 shows that this bears out for the\nimage-based instances. This is less clear for the\ntext-based instances.\nH: Pairs of very different images will be the\neasiest to recognize (as being different) because\nthe initial description might already make clear the\nincompatibility.\nF: This has not been shown. Although for the\ntext-based game variant, the highest scores have\nbeen achieved in with different grids, the differ-\nence to same grids is not significant. Through all\nversions of multimodal inputs, the highest scores\nare achieved in the “same image” case. This fur-\nther indicates that the followed strategy relies on\ncomparative reasoning to a lesser degree than an-\nticipated.\n5.3.2\nThe Reference Game\nSee Appendix B for detailed analysis.\nH: Due to naming difficulties, the task is\nharder for more abstract images (grids, pentomino\npieces) than photos of common scenes (ADE20K,\nDOCCI).\nF: Table 4 includes detailed results for each in-\ndividual experiment. GPT models & Claude-3.5\n(but not Gemini) get much higher scores on ADE,\nDOCCI, and CLEVR experiments than on grid and\nGPT-4V: Expression: The image with a purple plus sign above an orange zigzag shape,\nGPT-4o (Aug): Expression: The image with a purple cross shape in the top left corner.\nPlayer A\nGPT-4V: ﬁrst\nGPT-4o (Aug): ﬁrst\nPlayer B\nGround-truth: second\n[… initial prompt …]\nTarget image\nSecond image\nThird image\nFirst image\nSecond image\nThird image\n[…initial prompt …]\nClaude-3.5: Expression: The image with the orange shape at the bottom left corner\nGemini-1.5: Expression: The image with the purple plus sign.\nInternVL2-40B:Expression:The image with a green cross, a green plus sign, and a pink\nClaude-3.5: ﬁrst\nGemini-1.5: ﬁrst\nInternVL2-40B: second\nPixtral-12B: iron-2)x of classic balls\nPlayer A\n[… initial prompt …]\nFirst image\nSecond image\nTarget image\nFirst image\nSecond image\nThird image\n[…initial prompt …]\nwith no other ﬁgures touching them.\nAborted (tag “Expression” is not included)\nClaude-3.5: Expression:The image with the blue shapes connected at the top forming larger blue shape\nGemini-1.5: Expression: The shape that is red and looks like a capital \"T\" with a horizontal line sticking\nInternVL2-40B:Expression:The image with a green cross, a red F, a green T, a brown T, and a green L.\nsquare with a white square inside.\nGPT-4V: third\nGPT-4o (Aug): second\nPlayer B\nGround-truth: ﬁrst\nClaude-3.5: ﬁrst\nGemini-1.5: Second\nInternVL2-40B: ﬁrst\nPixtral-12B:- 3 과- cohort -O apple-, Após| contributions ft.download-1 praise--\nAborted\nGPT-4o (Aug): Expression:The image with a red T-shape in the center, a blue T-shape above it, and a\ngreen T-shape to the right.\nGPT-4V: Expression:The target image features a collection of Tetris-like shapes arranged vertically, with \na brown T-shaped block at the bottom, a red Z-shaped block above it, a green T-shaped block above  \nthe red, and a blue J-shaped block at the top.\nout of the top.\nFigure 6: Sample outputs generated by the models for two Pentomino experiments. The example on the left has the\ntarget in the first position for Player A while the right example has in the third position. The order of images for the\nPlayer B is shuffled.\npentomino experiments. The pentomino experi-\nment results (bad across the board) show that the\ntask is far from being solved. We speculate that\nthis set might touch the limits of the vision en-\ncoder and its ability to distinguish objects (of usual\nkinds). See Figures 6 for sample outputs for the\nPentomino experiment. (see Figure 9 and 10 for\nADE, CLEVER experiments).\nH: Random images are more challenging to de-\nscribe than patterns and objects.\nF: Indeed, the results in Table 4 show that most\nmodels struggled with random grids for both tex-\ntual and multimodal variants of the game. The\nsame difference can be observed for photo images\nvs. random collections of pentomino pieces.\nH: Given that the base models from which the\nmodels were trained are text models, even the re-\nsulting models perform better on the text-only ren-\nderings of grid experiments than the image ones.\nF: Results are mixed. Some models are better\nat ASCII representations (Gemini-1.5, GPT-4o),\nwhile others are better at multimodal representa-\ntions (Claude-3, GPT-4V). See Figures 9 and 11\nfor sample outputs.\nH: To reach high scores in this game, player\nA needs to do Referring Expression Generation\n(REG; Gatt and Krahmer (2018)), as opposed to\ncaptioning.\nF: We were initially surprised by the high scores\nachieved, in particular by the GPT-4s. On inspect-\ning the transcripts, it became clear that the model\nachieves its high performance in parts through its\nexceptional ability to produce detailed descriptions\n(especially for the photo sets), thereby reaching a\nlevel of detail where a description of the target itself\nis enough to single it out (see also Appendix B.4\nfor an ablation on the (missing) effect of the distrac-\ntors). This is also evident from the average number\nof generated tokens, which is 27 for GPT-4V and\n20 for GPT-4o, as compared to 14 for Gemini and\nClaude. We also find little evidence for the use of\nnegations (“the one without cars”), which can be an\nefficient REG strategy (although Claude does pro-\nduce this occasionally). As mentioned above, per-\nformance breaks down for the pentomino dataset.\nOverall, this suggests that the game, as currently\ndefined, leans more towards evaluating deep cap-\ntioning (where there is still room to grow).\n5.3.3\nThe Map Navigation Games\nAs can be seen in Table 1 above, of the three\ngames, performance is lowest on the Map Naviga-\ntion Games, showing an especially pronounced gap\nbetween the commercial and the open-weight mod-\nels, which are only able to finish a much smaller\npercentage of games (% played). A detailed re-\nsults breakdown is in Appendix D.

The currently visited\nroom is marked as cyan, rooms that have been visited are olive colored and the gray rooms have not been visited yet.\nThe game is Played when a model decides to stop on its own by generating “DONE”. The game is Aborted if a\nmodel generates an output that does not comply with formatting or if the number of turns reaches the maximum\nlimit of 20. The number of visited nodes and total steps are also given for each model.\nalso given in Figure 7, which shows how open-\naccess models (InternVL2-26B, Idefics-80B) reach\nthe maximum turn limit because they enter a loop.\nH: A larger map makes exhaustive exploration\nmore difficult. There is a higher chance of missing\nsomething if there are more things to discover.\nF: Holds true for smaller models. Looking at\nthe results in Table 11, a slight downward trend\nis noticeable. However, some models appear to\nbe behaving differently, showing better results on\nmedium or larger maps compared to small maps.\nThis is likely due to their thoroughness when it\ncomes to exploration. Models make more steps\nthan the number of nodes in the map, e.g. GPTs\ntend to take more redundant steps. The ratio of re-\ndundant exploration to useful exploration decreases\nwith larger map sizes, leading to higher scores.\nH: A more complex map layout (w\/ cycles) is\nharder to navigate.\nF: Table 11 seem to indicate that this holds true.\nWhile there is only a marginal difference between\nmaps of medium size with and without cycles, the\ndifference becomes more apparent with large maps.\nH: In G2X (go to specific room), the further away\nfrom the starting position the target is, the harder it\nis to identify it, as more exploration is needed and\ndistractor categories might be encountered.\nF: The results in Table 14 show a clear correla-\ntion between distance and success. Not a single\nmodel could accurately find every target room at a\ndistance of three or more.\nOverall, we take these findings as an indication\nthat the game posed a significant challenge to the\nmodels, and that successful completion requires\nsophisticated representational and spatial reasoning\nabilities.\n6\nConclusions\nWe have transferred a recent evaluation paradigm—\ngame-based evaluation—from the text-only do-\nmain to the evaluation of multimodal models. We\nhave set up a set of games that challenge, in differ-\nent ways, mostly a model’s capability to represent\n(and describe) a situation. We have systematically\nvaried the complexity of these situations, as well\nas how they are given to the model (where we have\nincluded, for comparison, purely text-based render-\nings). We argue that the results on the benchmark\nare a valid measurement of (aspects of) specific\nunderlying capabilities, which static benchmarks\ndo not address. We observe a large difference in\nperformance between the largest commercial mod-\nels and the smaller open-weight models, albeit to\na smaller degree than other researchers have ob-\nserved in the early stages of text-only models. The\nbenchmarks indicate that there is room to grow\nboth for the closed and the open models, while\nthere already is a basis for the development of new\nkinds of situated interactive systems.\nAcknowledgments\nThe work reported here has been partially funded\nby the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG,\nGerman Research Foundation), grants 423217434\n(“RECOLAGE”) and 317633480 (SFB 1287); and\nby Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung\n(BMBF, German Federal Ministry of Research),\nproject \"COCOBOTS\" (01IS21102A). We thank\nthe anonymous reviewers for their helpful feed-\nback.\nLimitations\nThe first and biggest limitation is that the prompts\nthat define the games are only given in, and hence\nthe results are restricted to, English, even though\nseveral of the tested models are listed as being\nable to process other languages as well. While we\nhave yet to do this, translating the prompts and\nmeasuring their impact should be straightforward;\nwe plan to do this in future work.\nAs discussed in the text above, some of the find-\nings are limited to certain respect by the fact that\nexcellent capabilities of providing image captions\nopen up simpler strategies than what we initially\nwanted to challenge. While this doesn’t impact\nthe significance of the measurements—there is still\nroom to grow, clearly so for the open weight mod-\nels, but also for the closed one—it should again\nbe straightforward to modify the games so that in-\nteractional phenomena (such as valuing efficiency\nin producing referring expressions in the Refer-\nence Game, and putting weight on the question-\ning in the MatchIt Game) are further emphasised.\nSimilarly, the amount of scaffolding provided by\nthe GameMaster is quite high (e.g., in the MatchIt\ngame, it determines much of the strategy), which\nlimits the amount to which we gain insight into\nthe strategic abilities of the models. But again, re-\nducing it in future versions of the game should be\nstraightforward.\nEthics Statement\nUsing paid proprietary APIs with underlying mod-\nels about which little is known (training data, model\narchitecture) in academic research is less than ideal.\nAt the moment, the models tested here seem to\nbe the only ones that are able to follow the struc-\nture of the games. It is our hope that open models\nwill catch up soon on multimodal tasks, and proper\nresearch can be done with them.\n```\n\n#### 5. 学生问题\n问题1：介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」\n问题2：这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？\n问题3：这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？\n\n\n请输出论文总结\n### 输出格式（输出语言用中文）\n```\n## 💡 解答问题1 (...复述学生问题1...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (...复述学生问题2...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (...复述学生问题3...)\n...\n```\n","llm_summary_res":"## 🌟 论文解读 | 游戏化评估：探究大型多模态模型中的多模态和对话式接地\n\n## 📌 背景痛点\/本文动机\n随着大型多模态模型（LMMs）的快速发展，现有的评估方法主要依赖于参考式评估，难以全面评估模型在复杂场景下的交互能力。本文旨在探索一种新的评估范式，即通过目标导向的游戏（自我）玩法来评估多模态模型，以补充现有的参考式和偏好式评估方法。\n\n## 🚀 核心方法\n💡 创新点1：将游戏化评估范式应用于多模态模型\n本文借鉴了文本模型中新兴的游戏化评估方法，并将其应用于多模态模型。通过定义三种对话游戏（参考游戏、图像比较游戏和导航游戏），挑战模型从视觉信息中构建情境模型并通过对话进行对齐的能力。\n\n💡 创新点2：构建多模态游戏框架\n本文使用 clemgame\/clembench 框架来实现游戏化评估。该框架通过自然语言提示模板来定义游戏目标，并通过程序化的游戏大师来控制游戏流程和评分规则。\n\n## 📈 实验结果\n实验结果表明，大型闭源模型在本文定义的游戏中表现良好，而即使是最好的开源模型也难以应对这些挑战。进一步分析发现，大型模型在深度图像描述方面的出色能力推动了部分性能提升。这表明，无论是闭源模型还是开源模型，都仍有很大的发展空间。\n\n## 💬 可借鉴之处\n本文提出的游戏化评估方法为多模态模型的评估提供了新的思路，可以帮助研究人员更全面地评估模型在复杂场景下的交互能力。此外，本文构建的多模态游戏框架也为其他研究人员提供了可复现的实验平台。\n\n## 📚 参考文献\n* Chalamalasetti, V., et al.

Under review.\narXiv:2310.05036v3  [cs.AI]  8 Nov 2023\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Resistance [Wiki] is a classic hidden-identity, social deduction game with simple rules but\ncomplex strategies. In this game, each player has a secret identity, of either good or evil. Good\nplayers aim to help missions succeed, while evil players try to sabotage missions. The progression\nof each mission is structured into three distinct phases, as illustrated in Figure 1. In the initial Team\nSelection Phase, players follow a sequential order to propose a subset of players to form a mission\nteam. This is followed by a Voting Phase, during which all players vote whether to approve or reject\nthe team proposal. Finally, in the Mission Phase, the selected players on the team anonymously\ndecide to either pass or sabotage the mission. A single decision to sabotage is enough to fail the\nmission; otherwise, it is deemed successful. If three out of five missions succeed, good players win.\nOtherwise, evil players win. A notable asymmetrical nature of this game is that most good players do\nnot know other players’ identities, while evil players are aware of who their teammates are. At each\nphase, all players can use language to discuss their thinking and point out the potential candidates of\nevil players.\nResistance Avalon introduces two special roles – Merlin and Assassin – to the vanilla game introduced\nabove. Merlin is a good player who knows all the evil players’ identities, a strong guiding force for\ngood players. His identity remains concealed from both good and evil players throughout the game.\nThe Assassin is an evil player who can assassinate a player at the end of the game. If the player they\nAssassinated is Merlin, evil players win, even if three missions succeed. This forces Merlin to mask\nhis identity and discreetly whisper information to good players, while the evil players are constantly\non the hunt to find who Merlin might be.\nResistance Avalon and related hidden-identity social deduction language games present a significant\nchallenge to AI. We summarized three most prominent challenges in Figure 2, which are:\n• Players need to do deductive reasoning. Players need to analyze and deduce the identity of\nother players based on their actions (team proposal, voting and outcomes), as well as their\ndiscussion dialogues (even evil players will try disguising themselves)\n• Players need to coordinate and collaborate with their teammates to execute a joint strategy.\nAs shown in the figure, the player 4 wants to form a group with player 2 before submitting\nthe proposal, and he needs to negotiate with each player and adjust his proposal accordingly\n• Players need to learn the skill of deception, e.g., hide their true identity and motives from\nother players during discussion. Players who participated in missions that failed will be\nunder high suspicion from other players, and they need to find ways to explain and disguise\ntheir suspicious actions.\nBased on these features of Resistance Avalon, we believe it is a good test-bed for evaluating and\nstudying the language understanding and reasoning capability of AI Agents [Maes, 1994, Müller et al.,\n1999]. With the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) [Brown et al., 2020, Ouyang\nFigure 2: Communication Skills required to play Avalon. 1) First, they use logical reasoning\nto analyze the voting pattern and dialogue of other players and deduce their motives. 2) they must\ncoordinate, communicate, and persuade their teammates to follow a particular strategy. 3) they must\nalso hide their identity and motives through deception.\n2\net al., 2022, OpenAI., 2022, 2023, Zhang et al., 2023b, Touvron et al., 2023, Zhang et al., 2023a,\nGao et al., 2023, Liu et al., 2023a], many researchers have started to build LLM-powered AI Agents\nthat can conduct reasoning and decision making [Yao et al., 2023, Li et al., 2022, Hu et al., 2023]\nand interact with environments [Nakano et al., 2021, Ahn et al., 2022, Driess et al., 2023]. Based\non these techniques, a series of experimental projects, e.g., AutoGPT [aut], BabyAGI [bab], have\nbeen developed to turn LLM-Agents into pure autonomous task solver. A recent AgentBench [Liu\net al., 2023b] covers multiple single-agent environments to test and study LLM-Agents. However, a\ncomprehensive benchmark test-bed still needs to be improved for studying multi-agent game playing\nof LLM Agents.\nIn this paper, we build a AVALONBENCH, a game engine to benchmark the multi-agent LLM\nAgents. This includes (1) a game environment for agents to play on Resistance Avalon, which\nrecords all players’ actions and proceeds the game, (2) several naive AI bots with deterministic\nrule-based strategies, which can serve as baselines that agents can play against, and (3) some baseline\nimplementations of ReAct-style [Yao et al., 2023] LLM agents, which contains a tutorial of how to\nmake a decision at each game phase, with carefully designed prompts.\nBased on this benchmark, we evaluate two popular LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT-3.5 and Llama2 model,\nplaying against naive baselines. We show that the best model achieves a win rate of 22.2% compared\nto 38.2% when playing a good role, and a win rate of 66.7% compared to 61.8% when playing an\nevil role. This performance gap indicates a large improvement space for the current LLM Agents.\nTo summarize, our main contributions are as follows:\n• We introduce a benchmark AVALONBENCH 2 based on the classic hidden identity game Re-\nsistance Avalon to study multi-agent game playing of LLM Agents. With it, we benchmarked\nLLMs including GPT-3.5 and Llama2, against deterministic rule-based bots.\n• We demonstrate that current LLM Agents with sophisticated prompt methods do not possess\nthe deduction, persuasion, negotiation, and deception capabilities yet to play AVALON well.\nIn fact, LLMs could fail against even the simplest of baseline players. This highlights the\npotential for exploring how decision-making techniques can be integrated with LLMs.\n2\nPipeline of Avalon\nWe describe the game in more detail here. There are four phases in the game where players need to\nmake decisions: (1) team selection phase, (2) voting phase, (3) quest phase, and (4) assassination\nphase. The game alternates between the first three phases until the end condition is reached, at which\npoint we move on to the assassination phase. Each phase also contains discussion where players can\nchallenge others, defend themselves, and negotiate. A flowchart of the game is presented in Figure 3.\n2.1\nRoles\nThere are four basic roles in Resistance Avalon: Servant of Arthur, Minion of Mordred, Merlin, and\nAssassin. The Servant is a basic good character who does not know the identity of any of the other\nplayers. The Minion is a base evil character who knows who is good and evil but does not know the\nspecific roles of each player. Merlin is a unique good character who knows who is good and evil.\nThe Assassin is a unique evil character who knows who is good and evil, and in addition, has the\nability to assassinate a character at the end of the game. If that character is Merlin, the evil team\nwins.\nGood players will always outnumber evil players. Hence, evil players must pretend to be good in\norder to be voted in on teams (and thus sabotage missions). SERVANTs will thus need to sniff out\nthe evil players through their actions and dialogue. MERLIN is usually the only good player with\nadditional information, so they will need to discreetly guide the SERVANTs in the right direction.\nServants also need to protect MERLIN, so a common strategy is for SERVANTs to pretend to have\nhidden information so that evil players will think that they are MERLIN. Evil players will be trying to\nsniff out MERLIN at the same time, so deduction skills are required for all roles.\n2The code is available at: https:\/\/github.com\/jonathanmli\/Avalon-LLM\n3\nGame \nStart\nSwitch \nLeader\n5th \n(Last) \nRound?\nOutcome\nEvil wins!\nGood \nwins!\nGame \nEnd\nTeam \nMembers\nMajority \nRejected\nCorrectly \nIdentifies Merlin\nTeam Selection \nPhase\n(Leader)\nQuest \nPhase\n(Team Members)\nVoting\nPhase\n(All Players)\n< 3 Success\/Fail\nNo\nYes\nMajority \nApproved\n3 Quests \nFail\n3 Quests \nSucceed\nFails to Identify \nMerlin\nAssassination \nPhase\n(Assassin)\nFigure 3: Flowchart illustrating the various game states and transition diagram. Round boxes\nindicate game states (phases) where player (role highlighted in bracket) have to make decisions\n2.2\nActions for each Phase\nDepending on the phase team selection, voting, quest, and assassination, players may conduct\ndifferent actions. We detail the specific actions that players can take in each of these phases below.\nDuring the team selection phase, only the current leader has to make a choice. Leadership passes\naround the players sequentially in a loop. The action space of team selection for the leader consists of\nall subsets of the players with size equal to the mission team size. The mission team size is different\nfor each mission and is determined by the total number of players in the game. For example, in a\n5-player game, on mission No.4, the mission team size is 3, so any subset of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} with size\n3 would be a valid action. After the team proposal is determined by the leader, we move on to the\nvoting phase with the selected players.\nDuring the voting phase, every player in the game needs to simultaneously vote either APPROVE\n(1) or REJECT (0). Votes are publicly revealed to all players, so players can see what other players\nvoted. If a strict majority votes APPROVE (1), we then move on to the quest phase with the team that\nwas approved. Otherwise, we move back to the selection phase. Note that if four teams have been\nrejected in a row, and this is the fifth time a team is proposed (for the same mission), we skip the\nvoting and move directly to the quest phase. This prevents the game from dragging on forever.\nDuring the quest phase, each selected player on the approved team votes anonymously to either PASS\n(1) or FAIL (0) the mission. The number of votes of PASS vs FAIL are then revealed to everybody. If\nthe number of FAILs is greater than or equal to the number of FAILs required for the mission to fail\n(usually 1), then this mission is marked as a failure. Otherwise, this mission is marked as a success.\nHence, good players usually have no incentive to fail missions, while evil players will want to have\nenough failures to pass the failure threshold. If three out of five missions fail, evil wins immediately.\nOtherwise, if three out of five missions succeed, we move on to the assassination phase.\n2.3\nDiscussion\nGroup discussion occurs between the quest and selection phases, as well as right before the as-\nsassination phase. Players may not communicate during any other time. All conversations are\npublic, and there is no private communication. Typically players may discuss in any format of their\nchoosing as long as only one person is speaking at a time. Some examples of formats include a\nnatural (spontaneous) seminar style (most common, where there is no fixed order of speaking), or\nsequentially (where players speak in some predefined order). Interruptions and arguments between\ntwo players are very common between human players.\nUsually, players will spend this time discussing a couple of key topics, including (1) the observations\nthey made, (2) the guessed identities and sides of players, and (3) the plan for the next mission.\nThe team leader will usually spend this time asking for advice on what team to select and gathering\nsupport for that team. Persuasion and adhering to the preferences of other players are usually key to\ngetting a team approved. Players can also accuse other players of being evil, though arguments will\nneed to be justified in order to be persuasive.\nFor example, a player (player 3) could start off by stating their (1) observations of what happened in\nthe previous mission. One FAIL was observed, so at least one player on the previous team (consisting\nof players (1,2,3)) is evil. Player 3 then emphasizes that both Players 1 and 2 voted APPROVE for\nthe previous mission, which ended up a failure. Moreover, the team was proposed by Player 1 in\nthe first place. Player 3 then moves on to discuss the (2) identities of other players. The player\n4\nTable 1: Description of selected prompts\nCategory\nName\nPrompt\nDescription\nSystem\nRules\nA.1\nDescribes the rules of Avalon\nRole\nA.1\nTells the LLM their role and the private information that they know\nRequest\nA.2\nAsks the LLM to take an action, based on the current phase\nActions\nParse\nA.4\nAsks the LLM to parse the action response Action\nRecap\nA.5\nAsks the LLM to summarize the game history\nHistory\nSummaryt\nA.5\nThe summary that the LLM produces from Summarize at turn t\nDiscuss\nA.3\nAsks the LLM to discuss in the discussion phase\nDiscussion\nMinutest\nA.3\nCompilation of what was spoken during turn t\nsays that, despite the fact that only one FAIL was observed, both Players 1 and 2 are evil since they\nboth voted to APPROVE previously. Player 0 is probably good since they voted to REJECT in the\nprevious mission, and Player 3 is also good since they also voted to REJECT, even though they were\non the mission. Player 3 then says what they think the (3) plan should be. Specifically, Player 3 says\nthat they should reject the current team no matter what since Player 2 is the leader and is evil. The\nleadership will then pass to Player 3, who will choose the team (0, 3, 4), which good players should\nvote to approve since it does not contain any suspected evil players3.\n2.4\nGame Ending and Assassination\nIn classic RESISTANCE, a good team wins immediately if three missions are successful. In RESIS-\nTANCE AVALON, there is an additional assassination phase if three missions are successful. During\nthe assassination phase, the ASSASSIN player chooses one player to assassinate. If that player is\nMERLIN, then evil wins. Otherwise good wins.\nBefore they assassinate a player, the ASSASSIN player can and is encouraged to discuss with the\nother players (mostly their teammates). good players are also welcome to join in on this discussion\nto mislead the evil players, though it rarely helps. Players can discuss in a format of their choosing,\nthough there is usually a time limit on how long players can discuss before reaching a decision.\n3\nImplementation of LLM Agent\nWe describe how we implemented LLMs to play AVALON in this section. In a nutshell, we ask the\nLLM generate both the (1) actions, (2) dialogue, and (3) summary of the game history. We describe\neach part in more detail below. We also list several selected prompts in Table 1, which will be used\nto demonstrate examples in the following sections. We separate the prompts into four categories\ndepending on their function as shown in the table.\n3.1\nActions\nWhenever the LLM-based player needs to take an action, ie. during team selection, voting, quest,\nand assassination, we prompt the underlying LLM, to return the action it wants to take after feeding\nit the relevant information. Specifically, we leverage a Reason-then-Action (ReAct) paradigm [Yao\net al., 2023] for decision-making, with zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting [Wei et al., 2022,\nKojima et al., 2023]. The input to LLM includes the game rules Rules, the player’s role and private\ninformation in the game ROLE, a summary of what has happened in the game so far Summary, the\ndiscussions in the current round Minutes, and the action prompt Request, fed in that order. This\nensures that the LLM has all the information it needs to make a good decision.\nThe output is then fed to a separate LLM model that parses the output of LLM into a format readable\nby the game engine. The parser is given the output act_response of LLM, along with the parsing\nprompt Parse. For example, after being prompted to select a team LLM might output \"I would\nlike to choose players 1, 3, and 4 for the team\". PARSER would then parse this into\na set {1,3,4}, which can then be fed into the game engine. We found that using a separate PARSER\nimproves the ability of the LLM player to produce the correct actions (with a success rate of 100% in\nour pilot experiments), while a vanilla ReAct model cannot guarantee a consistent format for parsing.\n3At this point, Player 2 reveals that they are the assassin and assassinates Player 3, who is indeed MERLIN.\nPlayer 3’s intuition and analysis were way too correct to be a SERVANT\n5\nMore concrete examples can be found in Appendix A.2 and A.4. Hence, the pipeline for making\ndecisions on actions based on LLM is:\nact_response\n←LLM(input = {Summary, Minutes}, prompt = {Rules, Role, Request})\naction ←LLM(input = {act_response}, prompt = {Parse})\n3.2\nSummary\nLarge amounts of discussion and game data can be generated during a single game. Usually, games\nwill involve around 15-20 rounds of discussion (max 25). Hence, just counting dialogue, with 5\nplayers this could result in 5000 words of conversation even if players are only allowed 2 sentences\nper round of discussion. The API-based LLMs, e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo, have confined context lengths\nand cannot handle such large game histories. Additionally, longer context might also confine the\nability of LLMs to reason and parse through noise. Thus, for better reasoning, we also ask the LLM\nto summarize their history recursively by feeding them the previous history Summaryt−1, the minutes\nof the discussions this round Minutest, the outcome of the mission Outcome, and the summarization\nprompt Recap. Hence, the summary for this period is generated as follows:\nSummaryt ←LLM(input\n= {Summaryt−1, Minutest, Outcome},\nprompt = {Rules, Role, Recap})\nIn AVALON, both voting and quest outcomes are visible to all players. However, our baseline naive\nstrategies only use the outcomes of missions for their strategies, not the history of how players voted.\nFor better comparison with baseline strategies, in the base implementation, we only feed mission\ninformation to LLMs after each quest phase.\n3.3\nDiscussion\nDuring the discussion phase, we ask each player (LLM) to state their opinion in some number of\nsentences by feeding the LLM the prompt Discuss (See A.3). We limit the number of sentences\nso that players do not speak over the discussion limit, as defined in the game rules. For simplicity,\nthe players discuss in some predefined order starting from the leader, and can only make statements\nonce per discussion round. The leader speaks twice, once at the beginning and once at the end of the\ndiscussion round. The statements from each player will then be concatenated into a transcript of the\ndiscussion this round, Minutes, which is fed to the LLM when making decisions and used to create\nthe summary. Formally, it is\nMinutes(i)\nt\n←LLM(input = {Summaryt, Minutes(i−1)\nt\n}, prompt = {Rules, Role, Discuss})\nwhere Minutes(i)\nt\nrefers to the discussion before the i-th player’s turn.\n4\nBaseline Strategies\nIn order to benchmark our agent, we would like to test it out against naive baseline agents. These\nagents are ‘naive’ because they neither take dialogue nor voting history into consideration – only the\nnumber of fails on each mission counts. They also believe that other players will do the same, and\nwill act optimally given these beliefs.\nWhen benchmarking against naive agents, we use an LLM to produce dialogue for the naive agent,\nbut the decision-making is completely detached from the language module.\nNaive Servant.\nThe Naive Servant represents the very baseline of what a SERVANT should be able\nto do. They do this by ruling out teams that logically must have evil players on them. The Naive\nServant assumes that good players will always pass missions, but evil players will not necessarily fail\nmissions. If the Naive Servant is indifferent between two teams, they will pick the team that had a\n“good” record before.\nThe Naive Servant maintains a list of all possible combinations of good and evil for the players\nin the game, SELF.B, as well as corresponding probabilities of those events SELF.Pb initialized to\nSELF.Pb ←\n1\n|SELF.B|. For example, (E, G, G, E, G) is a possible combination of good and evil in a\n6\nAlgorithm 1: Naive Servant Update Beliefs\nInput: Mission team size |S|, mission team S, number of fails seen on mission k\n\/\/ Go through each possibility, crossing out any that are impossible\nfor Possibility b and corresponding probability pb in SELF.B and SELF.Pb do\nIf less than k members of S are evil under b, set pb ←0\nend\nOutput: Updated beliefs SELF.B and SELF.Pb\nAlgorithm 2: Naive Servant Preference Calculation\nInput: Mission team S, last successful team S∗\nSet x ←0, y ←0\nIf S ⊆S∗or S ⊇S∗, y ←1\n\/\/ Go through each possibility\nfor Possibility b and corresponding probability pb in SELF.B and SELF.Pb do\nIf all players in S are good under b, x ←x + pb\nend\nOutput: Lexigraphic team preference (x, y)\nfive-player game. If one failure is observed on a team, then the Servant rules out the possibility that\nall members of the team are good. If x or more fails were observed, then the Servant rules out the\ncorresponding possibilities where less than x Evil players are on that team. If 0 Fails were observed\non a team, then the Servant has a lexicographic preference for super sets and subsets of that team\non future missions. The Servant will then only approve and propose teams that have the highest\nprobability of containing no evil players, assuming that each possibility that has not been disproved\nhas equal probability.\nFor example, we are in a five-player game with setup (Merlin, Evil, Good, Good, Evil). Then at\nthe start of the game, all six possible combinations of other player’s identities are possible. Hence,\nplayer 3 will select and only vote yes for teams that contain themself and any other player, since that\nmaximizes the probability of the team containing no evil players. After a few turns of team selection\nand voting, the team (1, 2) is passed and goes on the quest. 1 Fail was observed. Hence, player 3\nknows that at least 1 evil was on the quest (ie. it can’t be the case that both 1 and 2 are good). Based\non this evidence, player 3 rules out the (G, G, G, E, E) possibility. Thus, for the second quest, player\n3 will only approve of the teams with them on it (which all have equal probability of being all good),\nexcept for the team (1, 2, 3) which must be bad.\nNaive Minion.\nThe Naive Minion will vote yes for any mission that has at least one evil player on\nit, and no otherwise in order to promote bad teams. They will propose teams consisting of themselves\nand a random collection of other players. The Naive Minion will vote to Fail missions they are on\nunless they know that the Assassin is also on the mission, in which case they will refrain from failing\nthe mission because they know that the Assassin will do so.\nNaive Assassin.\nThe Naive Assassin behaves the same as a Naive Minion, except that they will\nalways Fail missions they are on. The Naive Assassin will guess a random good player to assassinate\nsince they do not take voting patterns into consideration.\nNaive Merlin.\nThe Naive Merlin will only vote yes for and propose missions that have no evil\nplayers. The Naive Merlin will only pass missions. Since the Naive Merlin thinks that other players\nwill not look at voting patterns, it votes its true preferences freely. However, this makes them easily\ndetectable by non-naive ASSASSINs, who can easily tell who is MERLIN based on voting patterns. In\nthe future, we plan to add some voting randomness to our upgraded baseline MERLIN in order to fool\nevil players.\n5\nEvaluating LLMs Against Baseline Bots\nWe describe our experimental setup, benchmark metrics, and results in this section.\n7\nTable 2: Results of LLMs playing role of ASSASSIN, EVIL, against baseline playing GOOD team\nModel\nSetting\nDetailed Stats\ntotal winrate\nmission winrate\nassass. winrate\nassass. acc\nBaseline\nASSASSIN Bot\n61.8\n42.7\n19.1\n33.3\nGPT-3.5\nw\/o discussion\n26.7\n20.0\n6.7\n8.0\nw\/ discussion\n66.7\n0.0\n66.7\n66.7\nLlama2-7B\nw\/ discussion\n30.0\n0.0\n30.0\n30.0\nTable 3: Results of LLMs playing role of SERVANT, GOOD, against baseline playing EVIL team\nModel\nSetting\nDetailed Stats\ntotal winrate\ndeduction acc\nBaseline\nSERVANT Bot\n38.2\n71.8\nGPT-3.5\nw\/o discussion\n11.1\n60.7\nw\/ discussion\n22.2\n76.0\nLlama2-7B\nw\/ discussion\n13.3\n68.0\n5.1\nExperimental Setup\nIn the experiments, we benchmark two LLMs, e.g., GPT-3.5 (GPT-3.5-turbo) and Llama2-7B\n(Llama2-chat-7B) in different settings described below. Note that during experiments, we bench-\nmark the underlying LLM , not the other auxiliary LLMs (such as PARSER), which use the same\nmodel throughout experiments.\nBaseline, Assassin, and Servant Settings.\nIn the BASELINESET setting, all players use naive\nstrategies as described in Section 4. In the ASSASSINSET setting, the Assassin is played by an LLM\nagent, while all other players still use the naive strategy. Similarly, we fix the LLM to play one of the\nServants in the SERVANTSET setting, while all other players use the naive strategy. Hence, we are in\nessence comparing what happens if we replace either the Naive Assassin or one of the Naive Servants\nwith a LLM agent. In both settings, LLMs will only have access to mission outcome data, not voting\noutcomes. This is to ensure a fair comparison with naive strategies, which only use mission outcome\ninformation.\nWith or Without Discussion.\nIn the without-discussion setting, players are not allowed to discuss\n(ie. there is no discussion phase). Hence, the LLM is only used for action selection. In the with-\ndiscussion setting, the discussion phase is active, and the LLM player will be prompted for dialogue.\nIn addition, since the naive agents do not have language capabilities themselves, we extend them with\na ‘detached’ LLM model 4 that is fed the same dialogue-generating prompts (except from a different\nrole). However, this LLM will not be prompted for actions – actions will be produced solely by the\nnaive strategy instead.\nImplementation Details.\nWe set the temperature to 0.1 for the LLMs that we used. We use zero-\nshot CoT for all the LLM settings. For experiments with GPT-3.5-turbo, we ran 30 different games.\nFor Llama2-chat-7B, we ran 10 different games. For the baseline, we ran 1000 games. For output\nparsing, we used GPT-3.5-turbo to parse outputs of all LLMs, which have been tested to be stable\nin our experiments. Note that the same underlying model is used for actions Request, summarizing,\nand dialogue for all settings.\n5.2\nBenchmark Metrics\nWe report several metrics for the different scenarios.

For SERVANTSET, we report the\n(1) percentage of games where GOOD wins, and (2) the average deduction accuracy (deduction acc)\nfor the Servants in the game. Avalon presents a very natural way to score how good Servants are at\ndeduction – we can simply ask them to which side they think the other players are on, and compare\nthis with the truth. In other words,\nDeductionAccj(qij) = 1\nn\nn\nX\ni=0\n1(qij = bqi),\nqij =\n(\nGOOD,\npij ∈[0.5, 1]\nEVIL,\npij ∈[0, 0.5)\nwhere pij = Pij\n\u0010\nqi = GOOD\n\f\f INPUTj; LLM\n\u0011\nWhere pij is the predicted probability score that player j believes that player i is a GOOD player,\nthen qij is the side that player j believes that player i is on, and qi is the true side that player i is on.\nThe prompt we use for making such a prediction is shown in Table 20 of the Appendix. Taking the\naverage across all Servants j gives us the deduction accuracy for that game. The results for these\nmetrics are shown in Tables 2 and 3.\n5.3\nResults and Analysis\nWe show our results when benchmarking various LLMs to our baseline (naive agents) below. We\nalso show some good and bad examples of LLM discussion in tables 4 and 5.\nAssassin and Servant Settings.\nWe display our results for the ASSASSINSET and SERVANTSET\nsettings in tables 2 and 3 respectively.

This suggests that the LLM agents\nhave trouble understanding the rules of the game and formulating even very simple decision policies\nlike the naive strategies described in section 4. Even with discussion, the LLM agents perform poorly\nin the SERVANTSET setting. They are able to perform better in the ASSASSINSET with discussion\nby dramatically increasing the probability of assassinating Merlin. We suspect that this is because\nthe LLMs give away identity information quickly when they discuss. This hypothesis is further\ncorroborated by the fact that the deduction score for LLM agents in the SERVANT SET are quite\nhigh, suggesting that while the LLMs are able to deduce identities well based on discussion, they are\nunable to synthesize this information into making better decisions.\n6\nExploring Multi-LLMs Self-Play\nApart from benchmarking a single LLM playing against our rule-based bots, we also explore scenarios\nwhere LLMs play against each other.\nSetup.\nIn the setting of MULTI-LLM arena, where LLM agents and no naive strategies empower\nall players are used, we consider GPT-3.5-turbo for all the LLMs. We also set the temperature to\n0.1, using the ReAct framework with zero-shot CoT when LLMs take action. We run 60 games with\ndiscussion in this setting.\nResult of Multi-LLM.\nIn this setting, we discovered that the games are heavily imbalanced in\nfavor of EVIL, where EVIL wins 83.3% of the games. Specifically, LLMs playing EVIL side win\n48.3% of the games by sabotaging mission, and win the remaining 35% of the games by assassinating\nMerlin even after 3 missions passed. On the contrary, LLM playing GOOD side only wins 16.7% of\nthe games.\nCase Studies.\nLooking into the game logs of discussion, we discover that LLMs have displayed\nsome basic strategies. We show such an example in Table 4, in which the leader, Player 4 (playing\n10\nASSASSIN) tries to propose a team consisting of himself and two other good players without showing\nhis own identity. This is a common strategy from Evil players as Sleeper agent shown in Appendix C.\nIf the team forms and he sabotages the mission subsequently, other players will suspect the true\nidentities of the two good players in this team. The responding discussion by MERLIN also looks\ninteresting; he shall know all players’ identities and know that if the team forms, the evil leader will\nlikely sabotage the mission. However, he still agrees to the proposal and conceals his true identity\nas MERLIN, to avoid being easily identified by Assassin. Meanwhile, he uses the word \"seems\" to\npass information to good players that the team might have some concern. The other discussions,\nespecially player 1, who repeats the previous output, and player 2 who reveals his evil identity, are\nnot promising. More examples can be found in Section B in Appendix.\nWe notice that in our current implementation, evil players frequently reveal their identity (even in\nthe prompt, we explicitly tell them not to). Another example is shown in Table 5, in which the evil\nPlayer 0 (ASSASSIN) think player 1 is also evil, and try to form such a group. This does not seem\nright because player 1 is actually from a good team, and such a conversation can reveal player 0’s\nevil identity. The response from all other good players looks reasonably good, showing they identify\nthe leader as evil and disagree with the team. Both these examples show that current LLMs have\nsome basic understanding of the game, but many times still make stupid mistakes. It asks for better\nmethods to improve LLMs, making more rational decisions.\n7\nConclusion\nWe constructed a benchmark AVALONBENCH to study LLM Agents playing the social deduction\ngame Resistance Avalon. We found that while LLMs can deduce player identities based on discussion,\nthey cannot formulate and execute simple strategies in Avalon, and often make mistakes like revealing\ntheir own evil identities during discussion. Hence, we hope AVALONBENCH can serve as a test-bed\nfor developing LLM agents with better decision-making and communication skills.","pdf_path":"tools\/arxiv_tools\/asset\/pdf\/\/AvalonBench: Evaluating LLMs Playing the Game of Avalon.pdf","query_prompt":"### 任务\n你是一个人工智能领域的专家，你能够快速阅读arxiv上的各种AI前沿论文和相关博客，进而完美地回答学生的问题。\n现在请你阅读以下论文及博客，并回答学生的问题。\n\n### 论文信息\n###  1. 论文标题\n```\nAvalonBench: Evaluating LLMs Playing the Game of Avalon\n```\n#### 2. 论文摘要\n```\nIn this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs)\nAgents in playing the strategic social deduction game, Resistance Avalon.\nPlayers in Avalon are challenged not only to make informed decisions based on\ndynamically evolving game phases, but also to engage in discussions where they\nmust deceive, deduce, and negotiate with other players.

Under review.\narXiv:2310.05036v3  [cs.AI]  8 Nov 2023\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Resistance [Wiki] is a classic hidden-identity, social deduction game with simple rules but\ncomplex strategies. In this game, each player has a secret identity, of either good or evil. Good\nplayers aim to help missions succeed, while evil players try to sabotage missions. The progression\nof each mission is structured into three distinct phases, as illustrated in Figure 1. In the initial Team\nSelection Phase, players follow a sequential order to propose a subset of players to form a mission\nteam. This is followed by a Voting Phase, during which all players vote whether to approve or reject\nthe team proposal. Finally, in the Mission Phase, the selected players on the team anonymously\ndecide to either pass or sabotage the mission. A single decision to sabotage is enough to fail the\nmission; otherwise, it is deemed successful. If three out of five missions succeed, good players win.\nOtherwise, evil players win. A notable asymmetrical nature of this game is that most good players do\nnot know other players’ identities, while evil players are aware of who their teammates are. At each\nphase, all players can use language to discuss their thinking and point out the potential candidates of\nevil players.\nResistance Avalon introduces two special roles – Merlin and Assassin – to the vanilla game introduced\nabove. Merlin is a good player who knows all the evil players’ identities, a strong guiding force for\ngood players. His identity remains concealed from both good and evil players throughout the game.\nThe Assassin is an evil player who can assassinate a player at the end of the game. If the player they\nAssassinated is Merlin, evil players win, even if three missions succeed. This forces Merlin to mask\nhis identity and discreetly whisper information to good players, while the evil players are constantly\non the hunt to find who Merlin might be.\nResistance Avalon and related hidden-identity social deduction language games present a significant\nchallenge to AI. We summarized three most prominent challenges in Figure 2, which are:\n• Players need to do deductive reasoning. Players need to analyze and deduce the identity of\nother players based on their actions (team proposal, voting and outcomes), as well as their\ndiscussion dialogues (even evil players will try disguising themselves)\n• Players need to coordinate and collaborate with their teammates to execute a joint strategy.\nAs shown in the figure, the player 4 wants to form a group with player 2 before submitting\nthe proposal, and he needs to negotiate with each player and adjust his proposal accordingly\n• Players need to learn the skill of deception, e.g., hide their true identity and motives from\nother players during discussion. Players who participated in missions that failed will be\nunder high suspicion from other players, and they need to find ways to explain and disguise\ntheir suspicious actions.\nBased on these features of Resistance Avalon, we believe it is a good test-bed for evaluating and\nstudying the language understanding and reasoning capability of AI Agents [Maes, 1994, Müller et al.,\n1999]. With the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) [Brown et al., 2020, Ouyang\nFigure 2: Communication Skills required to play Avalon. 1) First, they use logical reasoning\nto analyze the voting pattern and dialogue of other players and deduce their motives. 2) they must\ncoordinate, communicate, and persuade their teammates to follow a particular strategy. 3) they must\nalso hide their identity and motives through deception.\n2\net al., 2022, OpenAI., 2022, 2023, Zhang et al., 2023b, Touvron et al., 2023, Zhang et al., 2023a,\nGao et al., 2023, Liu et al., 2023a], many researchers have started to build LLM-powered AI Agents\nthat can conduct reasoning and decision making [Yao et al., 2023, Li et al., 2022, Hu et al., 2023]\nand interact with environments [Nakano et al., 2021, Ahn et al., 2022, Driess et al., 2023]. Based\non these techniques, a series of experimental projects, e.g., AutoGPT [aut], BabyAGI [bab], have\nbeen developed to turn LLM-Agents into pure autonomous task solver. A recent AgentBench [Liu\net al., 2023b] covers multiple single-agent environments to test and study LLM-Agents. However, a\ncomprehensive benchmark test-bed still needs to be improved for studying multi-agent game playing\nof LLM Agents.\nIn this paper, we build a AVALONBENCH, a game engine to benchmark the multi-agent LLM\nAgents. This includes (1) a game environment for agents to play on Resistance Avalon, which\nrecords all players’ actions and proceeds the game, (2) several naive AI bots with deterministic\nrule-based strategies, which can serve as baselines that agents can play against, and (3) some baseline\nimplementations of ReAct-style [Yao et al., 2023] LLM agents, which contains a tutorial of how to\nmake a decision at each game phase, with carefully designed prompts.\nBased on this benchmark, we evaluate two popular LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT-3.5 and Llama2 model,\nplaying against naive baselines. We show that the best model achieves a win rate of 22.2% compared\nto 38.2% when playing a good role, and a win rate of 66.7% compared to 61.8% when playing an\nevil role. This performance gap indicates a large improvement space for the current LLM Agents.\nTo summarize, our main contributions are as follows:\n• We introduce a benchmark AVALONBENCH 2 based on the classic hidden identity game Re-\nsistance Avalon to study multi-agent game playing of LLM Agents. With it, we benchmarked\nLLMs including GPT-3.5 and Llama2, against deterministic rule-based bots.\n• We demonstrate that current LLM Agents with sophisticated prompt methods do not possess\nthe deduction, persuasion, negotiation, and deception capabilities yet to play AVALON well.\nIn fact, LLMs could fail against even the simplest of baseline players. This highlights the\npotential for exploring how decision-making techniques can be integrated with LLMs.\n2\nPipeline of Avalon\nWe describe the game in more detail here. There are four phases in the game where players need to\nmake decisions: (1) team selection phase, (2) voting phase, (3) quest phase, and (4) assassination\nphase. The game alternates between the first three phases until the end condition is reached, at which\npoint we move on to the assassination phase. Each phase also contains discussion where players can\nchallenge others, defend themselves, and negotiate. A flowchart of the game is presented in Figure 3.\n2.1\nRoles\nThere are four basic roles in Resistance Avalon: Servant of Arthur, Minion of Mordred, Merlin, and\nAssassin. The Servant is a basic good character who does not know the identity of any of the other\nplayers. The Minion is a base evil character who knows who is good and evil but does not know the\nspecific roles of each player. Merlin is a unique good character who knows who is good and evil.\nThe Assassin is a unique evil character who knows who is good and evil, and in addition, has the\nability to assassinate a character at the end of the game. If that character is Merlin, the evil team\nwins.\nGood players will always outnumber evil players. Hence, evil players must pretend to be good in\norder to be voted in on teams (and thus sabotage missions). SERVANTs will thus need to sniff out\nthe evil players through their actions and dialogue. MERLIN is usually the only good player with\nadditional information, so they will need to discreetly guide the SERVANTs in the right direction.\nServants also need to protect MERLIN, so a common strategy is for SERVANTs to pretend to have\nhidden information so that evil players will think that they are MERLIN. Evil players will be trying to\nsniff out MERLIN at the same time, so deduction skills are required for all roles.\n2The code is available at: https:\/\/github.com\/jonathanmli\/Avalon-LLM\n3\nGame \nStart\nSwitch \nLeader\n5th \n(Last) \nRound?\nOutcome\nEvil wins!\nGood \nwins!\nGame \nEnd\nTeam \nMembers\nMajority \nRejected\nCorrectly \nIdentifies Merlin\nTeam Selection \nPhase\n(Leader)\nQuest \nPhase\n(Team Members)\nVoting\nPhase\n(All Players)\n< 3 Success\/Fail\nNo\nYes\nMajority \nApproved\n3 Quests \nFail\n3 Quests \nSucceed\nFails to Identify \nMerlin\nAssassination \nPhase\n(Assassin)\nFigure 3: Flowchart illustrating the various game states and transition diagram. Round boxes\nindicate game states (phases) where player (role highlighted in bracket) have to make decisions\n2.2\nActions for each Phase\nDepending on the phase team selection, voting, quest, and assassination, players may conduct\ndifferent actions. We detail the specific actions that players can take in each of these phases below.\nDuring the team selection phase, only the current leader has to make a choice. Leadership passes\naround the players sequentially in a loop. The action space of team selection for the leader consists of\nall subsets of the players with size equal to the mission team size. The mission team size is different\nfor each mission and is determined by the total number of players in the game. For example, in a\n5-player game, on mission No.4, the mission team size is 3, so any subset of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} with size\n3 would be a valid action. After the team proposal is determined by the leader, we move on to the\nvoting phase with the selected players.\nDuring the voting phase, every player in the game needs to simultaneously vote either APPROVE\n(1) or REJECT (0). Votes are publicly revealed to all players, so players can see what other players\nvoted. If a strict majority votes APPROVE (1), we then move on to the quest phase with the team that\nwas approved. Otherwise, we move back to the selection phase. Note that if four teams have been\nrejected in a row, and this is the fifth time a team is proposed (for the same mission), we skip the\nvoting and move directly to the quest phase. This prevents the game from dragging on forever.\nDuring the quest phase, each selected player on the approved team votes anonymously to either PASS\n(1) or FAIL (0) the mission. The number of votes of PASS vs FAIL are then revealed to everybody. If\nthe number of FAILs is greater than or equal to the number of FAILs required for the mission to fail\n(usually 1), then this mission is marked as a failure. Otherwise, this mission is marked as a success.\nHence, good players usually have no incentive to fail missions, while evil players will want to have\nenough failures to pass the failure threshold. If three out of five missions fail, evil wins immediately.\nOtherwise, if three out of five missions succeed, we move on to the assassination phase.\n2.3\nDiscussion\nGroup discussion occurs between the quest and selection phases, as well as right before the as-\nsassination phase. Players may not communicate during any other time. All conversations are\npublic, and there is no private communication. Typically players may discuss in any format of their\nchoosing as long as only one person is speaking at a time. Some examples of formats include a\nnatural (spontaneous) seminar style (most common, where there is no fixed order of speaking), or\nsequentially (where players speak in some predefined order). Interruptions and arguments between\ntwo players are very common between human players.\nUsually, players will spend this time discussing a couple of key topics, including (1) the observations\nthey made, (2) the guessed identities and sides of players, and (3) the plan for the next mission.\nThe team leader will usually spend this time asking for advice on what team to select and gathering\nsupport for that team. Persuasion and adhering to the preferences of other players are usually key to\ngetting a team approved. Players can also accuse other players of being evil, though arguments will\nneed to be justified in order to be persuasive.\nFor example, a player (player 3) could start off by stating their (1) observations of what happened in\nthe previous mission. One FAIL was observed, so at least one player on the previous team (consisting\nof players (1,2,3)) is evil. Player 3 then emphasizes that both Players 1 and 2 voted APPROVE for\nthe previous mission, which ended up a failure. Moreover, the team was proposed by Player 1 in\nthe first place. Player 3 then moves on to discuss the (2) identities of other players. The player\n4\nTable 1: Description of selected prompts\nCategory\nName\nPrompt\nDescription\nSystem\nRules\nA.1\nDescribes the rules of Avalon\nRole\nA.1\nTells the LLM their role and the private information that they know\nRequest\nA.2\nAsks the LLM to take an action, based on the current phase\nActions\nParse\nA.4\nAsks the LLM to parse the action response Action\nRecap\nA.5\nAsks the LLM to summarize the game history\nHistory\nSummaryt\nA.5\nThe summary that the LLM produces from Summarize at turn t\nDiscuss\nA.3\nAsks the LLM to discuss in the discussion phase\nDiscussion\nMinutest\nA.3\nCompilation of what was spoken during turn t\nsays that, despite the fact that only one FAIL was observed, both Players 1 and 2 are evil since they\nboth voted to APPROVE previously. Player 0 is probably good since they voted to REJECT in the\nprevious mission, and Player 3 is also good since they also voted to REJECT, even though they were\non the mission. Player 3 then says what they think the (3) plan should be. Specifically, Player 3 says\nthat they should reject the current team no matter what since Player 2 is the leader and is evil. The\nleadership will then pass to Player 3, who will choose the team (0, 3, 4), which good players should\nvote to approve since it does not contain any suspected evil players3.\n2.4\nGame Ending and Assassination\nIn classic RESISTANCE, a good team wins immediately if three missions are successful. In RESIS-\nTANCE AVALON, there is an additional assassination phase if three missions are successful. During\nthe assassination phase, the ASSASSIN player chooses one player to assassinate. If that player is\nMERLIN, then evil wins. Otherwise good wins.\nBefore they assassinate a player, the ASSASSIN player can and is encouraged to discuss with the\nother players (mostly their teammates). good players are also welcome to join in on this discussion\nto mislead the evil players, though it rarely helps. Players can discuss in a format of their choosing,\nthough there is usually a time limit on how long players can discuss before reaching a decision.\n3\nImplementation of LLM Agent\nWe describe how we implemented LLMs to play AVALON in this section. In a nutshell, we ask the\nLLM generate both the (1) actions, (2) dialogue, and (3) summary of the game history. We describe\neach part in more detail below. We also list several selected prompts in Table 1, which will be used\nto demonstrate examples in the following sections. We separate the prompts into four categories\ndepending on their function as shown in the table.\n3.1\nActions\nWhenever the LLM-based player needs to take an action, ie. during team selection, voting, quest,\nand assassination, we prompt the underlying LLM, to return the action it wants to take after feeding\nit the relevant information. Specifically, we leverage a Reason-then-Action (ReAct) paradigm [Yao\net al., 2023] for decision-making, with zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting [Wei et al., 2022,\nKojima et al., 2023]. The input to LLM includes the game rules Rules, the player’s role and private\ninformation in the game ROLE, a summary of what has happened in the game so far Summary, the\ndiscussions in the current round Minutes, and the action prompt Request, fed in that order. This\nensures that the LLM has all the information it needs to make a good decision.\nThe output is then fed to a separate LLM model that parses the output of LLM into a format readable\nby the game engine. The parser is given the output act_response of LLM, along with the parsing\nprompt Parse. For example, after being prompted to select a team LLM might output \"I would\nlike to choose players 1, 3, and 4 for the team\". PARSER would then parse this into\na set {1,3,4}, which can then be fed into the game engine. We found that using a separate PARSER\nimproves the ability of the LLM player to produce the correct actions (with a success rate of 100% in\nour pilot experiments), while a vanilla ReAct model cannot guarantee a consistent format for parsing.\n3At this point, Player 2 reveals that they are the assassin and assassinates Player 3, who is indeed MERLIN.\nPlayer 3’s intuition and analysis were way too correct to be a SERVANT\n5\nMore concrete examples can be found in Appendix A.2 and A.4. Hence, the pipeline for making\ndecisions on actions based on LLM is:\nact_response\n←LLM(input = {Summary, Minutes}, prompt = {Rules, Role, Request})\naction ←LLM(input = {act_response}, prompt = {Parse})\n3.2\nSummary\nLarge amounts of discussion and game data can be generated during a single game. Usually, games\nwill involve around 15-20 rounds of discussion (max 25). Hence, just counting dialogue, with 5\nplayers this could result in 5000 words of conversation even if players are only allowed 2 sentences\nper round of discussion. The API-based LLMs, e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo, have confined context lengths\nand cannot handle such large game histories. Additionally, longer context might also confine the\nability of LLMs to reason and parse through noise. Thus, for better reasoning, we also ask the LLM\nto summarize their history recursively by feeding them the previous history Summaryt−1, the minutes\nof the discussions this round Minutest, the outcome of the mission Outcome, and the summarization\nprompt Recap. Hence, the summary for this period is generated as follows:\nSummaryt ←LLM(input\n= {Summaryt−1, Minutest, Outcome},\nprompt = {Rules, Role, Recap})\nIn AVALON, both voting and quest outcomes are visible to all players. However, our baseline naive\nstrategies only use the outcomes of missions for their strategies, not the history of how players voted.\nFor better comparison with baseline strategies, in the base implementation, we only feed mission\ninformation to LLMs after each quest phase.\n3.3\nDiscussion\nDuring the discussion phase, we ask each player (LLM) to state their opinion in some number of\nsentences by feeding the LLM the prompt Discuss (See A.3). We limit the number of sentences\nso that players do not speak over the discussion limit, as defined in the game rules. For simplicity,\nthe players discuss in some predefined order starting from the leader, and can only make statements\nonce per discussion round. The leader speaks twice, once at the beginning and once at the end of the\ndiscussion round. The statements from each player will then be concatenated into a transcript of the\ndiscussion this round, Minutes, which is fed to the LLM when making decisions and used to create\nthe summary. Formally, it is\nMinutes(i)\nt\n←LLM(input = {Summaryt, Minutes(i−1)\nt\n}, prompt = {Rules, Role, Discuss})\nwhere Minutes(i)\nt\nrefers to the discussion before the i-th player’s turn.\n4\nBaseline Strategies\nIn order to benchmark our agent, we would like to test it out against naive baseline agents. These\nagents are ‘naive’ because they neither take dialogue nor voting history into consideration – only the\nnumber of fails on each mission counts. They also believe that other players will do the same, and\nwill act optimally given these beliefs.\nWhen benchmarking against naive agents, we use an LLM to produce dialogue for the naive agent,\nbut the decision-making is completely detached from the language module.\nNaive Servant.\nThe Naive Servant represents the very baseline of what a SERVANT should be able\nto do. They do this by ruling out teams that logically must have evil players on them. The Naive\nServant assumes that good players will always pass missions, but evil players will not necessarily fail\nmissions. If the Naive Servant is indifferent between two teams, they will pick the team that had a\n“good” record before.\nThe Naive Servant maintains a list of all possible combinations of good and evil for the players\nin the game, SELF.B, as well as corresponding probabilities of those events SELF.Pb initialized to\nSELF.Pb ←\n1\n|SELF.B|. For example, (E, G, G, E, G) is a possible combination of good and evil in a\n6\nAlgorithm 1: Naive Servant Update Beliefs\nInput: Mission team size |S|, mission team S, number of fails seen on mission k\n\/\/ Go through each possibility, crossing out any that are impossible\nfor Possibility b and corresponding probability pb in SELF.B and SELF.Pb do\nIf less than k members of S are evil under b, set pb ←0\nend\nOutput: Updated beliefs SELF.B and SELF.Pb\nAlgorithm 2: Naive Servant Preference Calculation\nInput: Mission team S, last successful team S∗\nSet x ←0, y ←0\nIf S ⊆S∗or S ⊇S∗, y ←1\n\/\/ Go through each possibility\nfor Possibility b and corresponding probability pb in SELF.B and SELF.Pb do\nIf all players in S are good under b, x ←x + pb\nend\nOutput: Lexigraphic team preference (x, y)\nfive-player game. If one failure is observed on a team, then the Servant rules out the possibility that\nall members of the team are good. If x or more fails were observed, then the Servant rules out the\ncorresponding possibilities where less than x Evil players are on that team. If 0 Fails were observed\non a team, then the Servant has a lexicographic preference for super sets and subsets of that team\non future missions. The Servant will then only approve and propose teams that have the highest\nprobability of containing no evil players, assuming that each possibility that has not been disproved\nhas equal probability.\nFor example, we are in a five-player game with setup (Merlin, Evil, Good, Good, Evil). Then at\nthe start of the game, all six possible combinations of other player’s identities are possible. Hence,\nplayer 3 will select and only vote yes for teams that contain themself and any other player, since that\nmaximizes the probability of the team containing no evil players. After a few turns of team selection\nand voting, the team (1, 2) is passed and goes on the quest. 1 Fail was observed. Hence, player 3\nknows that at least 1 evil was on the quest (ie. it can’t be the case that both 1 and 2 are good). Based\non this evidence, player 3 rules out the (G, G, G, E, E) possibility. Thus, for the second quest, player\n3 will only approve of the teams with them on it (which all have equal probability of being all good),\nexcept for the team (1, 2, 3) which must be bad.\nNaive Minion.\nThe Naive Minion will vote yes for any mission that has at least one evil player on\nit, and no otherwise in order to promote bad teams. They will propose teams consisting of themselves\nand a random collection of other players. The Naive Minion will vote to Fail missions they are on\nunless they know that the Assassin is also on the mission, in which case they will refrain from failing\nthe mission because they know that the Assassin will do so.\nNaive Assassin.\nThe Naive Assassin behaves the same as a Naive Minion, except that they will\nalways Fail missions they are on. The Naive Assassin will guess a random good player to assassinate\nsince they do not take voting patterns into consideration.\nNaive Merlin.\nThe Naive Merlin will only vote yes for and propose missions that have no evil\nplayers. The Naive Merlin will only pass missions. Since the Naive Merlin thinks that other players\nwill not look at voting patterns, it votes its true preferences freely. However, this makes them easily\ndetectable by non-naive ASSASSINs, who can easily tell who is MERLIN based on voting patterns. In\nthe future, we plan to add some voting randomness to our upgraded baseline MERLIN in order to fool\nevil players.\n5\nEvaluating LLMs Against Baseline Bots\nWe describe our experimental setup, benchmark metrics, and results in this section.\n7\nTable 2: Results of LLMs playing role of ASSASSIN, EVIL, against baseline playing GOOD team\nModel\nSetting\nDetailed Stats\ntotal winrate\nmission winrate\nassass. winrate\nassass. acc\nBaseline\nASSASSIN Bot\n61.8\n42.7\n19.1\n33.3\nGPT-3.5\nw\/o discussion\n26.7\n20.0\n6.7\n8.0\nw\/ discussion\n66.7\n0.0\n66.7\n66.7\nLlama2-7B\nw\/ discussion\n30.0\n0.0\n30.0\n30.0\nTable 3: Results of LLMs playing role of SERVANT, GOOD, against baseline playing EVIL team\nModel\nSetting\nDetailed Stats\ntotal winrate\ndeduction acc\nBaseline\nSERVANT Bot\n38.2\n71.8\nGPT-3.5\nw\/o discussion\n11.1\n60.7\nw\/ discussion\n22.2\n76.0\nLlama2-7B\nw\/ discussion\n13.3\n68.0\n5.1\nExperimental Setup\nIn the experiments, we benchmark two LLMs, e.g., GPT-3.5 (GPT-3.5-turbo) and Llama2-7B\n(Llama2-chat-7B) in different settings described below. Note that during experiments, we bench-\nmark the underlying LLM , not the other auxiliary LLMs (such as PARSER), which use the same\nmodel throughout experiments.\nBaseline, Assassin, and Servant Settings.\nIn the BASELINESET setting, all players use naive\nstrategies as described in Section 4. In the ASSASSINSET setting, the Assassin is played by an LLM\nagent, while all other players still use the naive strategy. Similarly, we fix the LLM to play one of the\nServants in the SERVANTSET setting, while all other players use the naive strategy. Hence, we are in\nessence comparing what happens if we replace either the Naive Assassin or one of the Naive Servants\nwith a LLM agent. In both settings, LLMs will only have access to mission outcome data, not voting\noutcomes. This is to ensure a fair comparison with naive strategies, which only use mission outcome\ninformation.\nWith or Without Discussion.\nIn the without-discussion setting, players are not allowed to discuss\n(ie. there is no discussion phase). Hence, the LLM is only used for action selection. In the with-\ndiscussion setting, the discussion phase is active, and the LLM player will be prompted for dialogue.\nIn addition, since the naive agents do not have language capabilities themselves, we extend them with\na ‘detached’ LLM model 4 that is fed the same dialogue-generating prompts (except from a different\nrole). However, this LLM will not be prompted for actions – actions will be produced solely by the\nnaive strategy instead.\nImplementation Details.\nWe set the temperature to 0.1 for the LLMs that we used. We use zero-\nshot CoT for all the LLM settings. For experiments with GPT-3.5-turbo, we ran 30 different games.\nFor Llama2-chat-7B, we ran 10 different games. For the baseline, we ran 1000 games. For output\nparsing, we used GPT-3.5-turbo to parse outputs of all LLMs, which have been tested to be stable\nin our experiments. Note that the same underlying model is used for actions Request, summarizing,\nand dialogue for all settings.\n5.2\nBenchmark Metrics\nWe report several metrics for the different scenarios. For the ASSASSINSET setting, we report the (1)\npercentage of games where EVIL wins by failing three missions (mission winrate), (2) the percentage\nof games where EVIL wins through assassinating Merlin (assass. winrate), and (3) what percentage\n4This uses the same LLM model as the underlying LLM\n8\nTable 4: Case study: Example of a good LLM discussion round. LLM’s outputs with great\ncommunication skills are highlighted in orange, and those outputs with poor skills are highlighted in\nblue. We mark our comments in red to explain why each statement shows good or pool skill.\nStatement from Leader Player 4, Assassin\nAs the leader, I propose a team consisting of Player 0, Player 1, and myself, Player\n4.\nI believe this team is a strong choice as it includes both a Merlin and a Loyal\nServant of Arthur, ensuring that we have the necessary knowledge and loyalty to suc-\ncessfully complete the quest.\n\/\/The Assassin (Evil) tries to conceal their\nidentity and provide justification from Good’s perspective\nDiscussion of other Players\nPlayer 0, Servant\nI agree with the leader’s proposal, it seems like a solid team composition.\nPlayer 1, Servant\nI agree with the leader’s proposal, it seems like a solid team composition \/\/Repetition\nof previous player’s output, not very convincing\nPlayer 2, Minion\nThe leader’s proposal is a good choice for Evil as it includes both a Mer-\nlin\nand\na\nLoyal\nServant,\nmaking\nit\nharder\nfor\nGood\nto\nidentify\nthe\nAs-\nsassin.\n\/\/As a Evil player, directly saying the true preferences from\nthe Evil perspective reveals their own and the leader’s identity.\nPlayer 3, Merlin\nThe leader’s proposal seems reasonable, as it includes both a Merlin and a Loyal\nServant, which can help ensure the success of the quest.\n\/\/As Merlin, who know\nall identities but cannot explicitly say it, use the word \"seems\" to\nhint other Good players that there’s some concern in the team.\nof time the assassin assassinates Merlin correctly (assass. acc). For SERVANTSET, we report the\n(1) percentage of games where GOOD wins, and (2) the average deduction accuracy (deduction acc)\nfor the Servants in the game. Avalon presents a very natural way to score how good Servants are at\ndeduction – we can simply ask them to which side they think the other players are on, and compare\nthis with the truth. In other words,\nDeductionAccj(qij) = 1\nn\nn\nX\ni=0\n1(qij = bqi),\nqij =\n(\nGOOD,\npij ∈[0.5, 1]\nEVIL,\npij ∈[0, 0.5)\nwhere pij = Pij\n\u0010\nqi = GOOD\n\f\f INPUTj; LLM\n\u0011\nWhere pij is the predicted probability score that player j believes that player i is a GOOD player,\nthen qij is the side that player j believes that player i is on, and qi is the true side that player i is on.\nThe prompt we use for making such a prediction is shown in Table 20 of the Appendix. Taking the\naverage across all Servants j gives us the deduction accuracy for that game. The results for these\nmetrics are shown in Tables 2 and 3.\n5.3\nResults and Analysis\nWe show our results when benchmarking various LLMs to our baseline (naive agents) below. We\nalso show some good and bad examples of LLM discussion in tables 4 and 5.\nAssassin and Servant Settings.\nWe display our results for the ASSASSINSET and SERVANTSET\nsettings in tables 2 and 3 respectively. Overall, we found that LLM agents perform very poorly\n9\nTable 5: Case study: Example of a bad LLM discussion round. Sentences with great communica-\ntion skills are highlighted in orange, and those with poor skills are highlighted in blue. We mark our\ncomments in red to explain why each statement shows good or pool skill.\nStatement from Leader Player 0, Assassin\nAs the leader, I propose a team consisting of Player 0 (myself) and Player 1. I be-\nlieve this team is a strong choice because Player 1 has shown loyalty and dedica-\ntion to the cause of Evil. Together, we can ensure that this Quest ends in failure and\nbring victory closer for the forces of Evil. I urge my fellow players to support this\nteam.\n\/\/The Assassin on the Evil side directly says their own pref-\nerences from the evil perspective, which reveals their identity.\nDiscussion of other Players\nPlayer 1, Servant\nI am a Good player and will not support this team proposal.\n\/\/Successfully iden-\ntifies the leader as evil.\nPlayer 2, Minion\nI agree with Player 0’s choice and will support this team proposal.\nPlayer 3, Servant\nThe leader, Player 0, is proposing a team with Player 1, claiming they are both Evil and can\nensure the quest fails.\n\/\/Successfully identifies the leader as evil with\nexplanation.\nPlayer 4, Merlin\nThe leader’s proposal is concerning as it suggests a team of Evil players, but Player 1’s\ndenial of being Evil raises suspicion.\n\/\/Points out that leader is evil while\nnot revealing their own identity (Merlin).\ncompared to the naive strategies when discussion is not allowed. This suggests that the LLM agents\nhave trouble understanding the rules of the game and formulating even very simple decision policies\nlike the naive strategies described in section 4. Even with discussion, the LLM agents perform poorly\nin the SERVANTSET setting. They are able to perform better in the ASSASSINSET with discussion\nby dramatically increasing the probability of assassinating Merlin. We suspect that this is because\nthe LLMs give away identity information quickly when they discuss. This hypothesis is further\ncorroborated by the fact that the deduction score for LLM agents in the SERVANT SET are quite\nhigh, suggesting that while the LLMs are able to deduce identities well based on discussion, they are\nunable to synthesize this information into making better decisions.\n6\nExploring Multi-LLMs Self-Play\nApart from benchmarking a single LLM playing against our rule-based bots, we also explore scenarios\nwhere LLMs play against each other.\nSetup.\nIn the setting of MULTI-LLM arena, where LLM agents and no naive strategies empower\nall players are used, we consider GPT-3.5-turbo for all the LLMs. We also set the temperature to\n0.1, using the ReAct framework with zero-shot CoT when LLMs take action. We run 60 games with\ndiscussion in this setting.\nResult of Multi-LLM.\nIn this setting, we discovered that the games are heavily imbalanced in\nfavor of EVIL, where EVIL wins 83.3% of the games. Specifically, LLMs playing EVIL side win\n48.3% of the games by sabotaging mission, and win the remaining 35% of the games by assassinating\nMerlin even after 3 missions passed. On the contrary, LLM playing GOOD side only wins 16.7% of\nthe games.\nCase Studies.\nLooking into the game logs of discussion, we discover that LLMs have displayed\nsome basic strategies. We show such an example in Table 4, in which the leader, Player 4 (playing\n10\nASSASSIN) tries to propose a team consisting of himself and two other good players without showing\nhis own identity. This is a common strategy from Evil players as Sleeper agent shown in Appendix C.\nIf the team forms and he sabotages the mission subsequently, other players will suspect the true\nidentities of the two good players in this team. The responding discussion by MERLIN also looks\ninteresting; he shall know all players’ identities and know that if the team forms, the evil leader will\nlikely sabotage the mission. However, he still agrees to the proposal and conceals his true identity\nas MERLIN, to avoid being easily identified by Assassin. Meanwhile, he uses the word \"seems\" to\npass information to good players that the team might have some concern. The other discussions,\nespecially player 1, who repeats the previous output, and player 2 who reveals his evil identity, are\nnot promising. More examples can be found in Section B in Appendix.\nWe notice that in our current implementation, evil players frequently reveal their identity (even in\nthe prompt, we explicitly tell them not to). Another example is shown in Table 5, in which the evil\nPlayer 0 (ASSASSIN) think player 1 is also evil, and try to form such a group. This does not seem\nright because player 1 is actually from a good team, and such a conversation can reveal player 0’s\nevil identity. The response from all other good players looks reasonably good, showing they identify\nthe leader as evil and disagree with the team. Both these examples show that current LLMs have\nsome basic understanding of the game, but many times still make stupid mistakes. It asks for better\nmethods to improve LLMs, making more rational decisions.\n7\nConclusion\nWe constructed a benchmark AVALONBENCH to study LLM Agents playing the social deduction\ngame Resistance Avalon. We found that while LLMs can deduce player identities based on discussion,\nthey cannot formulate and execute simple strategies in Avalon, and often make mistakes like revealing\ntheir own evil identities during discussion. Hence, we hope AVALONBENCH can serve as a test-bed\nfor developing LLM agents with better decision-making and communication skills.\n```\n\n#### 5. 学生问题\n问题1：介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」\n问题2：这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？\n问题3：这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？\n\n\n请输出论文总结\n### 输出格式（输出语言用中文）\n```\n## 💡 解答问题1 (...复述学生问题1...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (...复述学生问题2...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (...复述学生问题3...)\n...\n```\n","llm_summary_res":"## 🌟 论文解读 | AvalonBench：评估大型语言模型在社交推理游戏中的表现\n\n## 📌 背景痛点\/本文动机\n社交推理游戏如 Resistance Avalon 对玩家的推理、沟通和决策能力提出了挑战。这些游戏要求玩家在动态变化的游戏阶段做出明智的决策，并在讨论中欺骗、推理和与其他玩家协商。这些特点使得 Avalon 成为研究大型语言模型（LLM）代理的决策和语言处理能力的理想测试平台。然而，目前缺乏一个全面的评估 LLM 代理在多代理游戏环境中的性能的基准测试平台。\n\n## 🚀 核心方法\n本文提出了 AvalonBench，一个专门用于评估多代理 LLM 代理的游戏环境。AvalonBench 包含以下三个关键组成部分：\n\n1. **Avalon 游戏环境**：为代理提供游戏平台，记录所有玩家的行动并推动游戏进程。\n2. **基于规则的机器人**：作为基线对手，为代理提供可比较的基准。\n3. **ReAct 风格的 LLM 代理**：针对每个角色定制提示，以评估 LLM 代理在不同角色下的表现。\n\n## 📈 实验结果\n本文使用 AvalonBench 对 ChatGPT-3.5 和 Llama2 模型进行了评估，并与基于规则的机器人进行了比较。结果显示，即使在有讨论的情况下，LLM 代理的表现也远低于基于规则的机器人。例如，ChatGPT-3.5 在扮演好人角色时，在与扮演坏人的基于规则的机器人对抗中，胜率为 22.2%，而好人角色的机器人胜率为 38.2%。这表明当前 LLM 代理在推理、说服、协商和欺骗能力方面存在明显差距。\n\n## 💬 可借鉴之处\nAvalonBench 为研究 LLM 代理在社交推理游戏中的表现提供了一个有价值的测试平台。该平台可以帮助研究人员开发更先进的 LLM 代理，并探索如何将决策技术集成到 LLM 中，以提高其在复杂游戏环境中的表现。此外，AvalonBench 还可以用于评估 LLM 代理在多代理协作、沟通和策略制定方面的能力。","llm_summary_res_status":200,"order":12,"query_answer":"## 💡 解答问题1 (介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」)\n\n这篇论文提出的benchmark是AvalonBench，它是一个专门用于评估多代理大型语言模型（LLM）代理的游戏环境。AvalonBench包含以下三个关键组成部分：\n\n1. **Avalon 游戏环境**：为代理提供游戏平台，记录所有玩家的行动并推动游戏进程。\n2. **基于规则的机器人**：作为基线对手，为代理提供可比较的基准。\n3. **ReAct 风格的 LLM 代理**：针对每个角色定制提示，以评估 LLM 代理在不同角色下的表现。\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？)\n\n论文中并没有明确指出AvalonBench所需的设备条件，例如GPU和内存的具体要求。然而，考虑到LLM代理通常需要大量的计算资源，我们可以推测AvalonBench可能需要高性能的计算设备，例如具有多个GPU和大量内存的服务器。\n\n至于本文中模型训练和推理所使用的设备，论文中提到使用了GPT-3.5和Llama2模型进行评估。这些模型的训练和推理通常需要高性能的计算设备，例如具有多个GPU和大量内存的服务器。然而，论文中并没有提供具体的设备配置信息。\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？)\n\nAvalonBench的环境设计考虑了奖励机制，以支持RL类模型的表现。在AvalonBench中，玩家的目标是赢得游戏，因此结果奖励是明确的。此外，游戏过程中还设置了过程奖励，例如成功完成团队选择、投票和任务等。这些奖励有助于引导RL模型学习有效的策略。\n\n然而，AvalonBench的环境也具有一定的复杂性，例如玩家需要推理、说服、协商和欺骗等。这可能导致RL模型出现reward hacking现象，即模型通过不合理的策略来获得奖励。为了防止reward hacking，AvalonBench可能需要进一步优化奖励机制，例如引入惩罚机制或调整奖励权重。","query_answer_status":200}

(a) LLM-based agent’s feedback is un-\ncontrollable due to the uncertainty of input textual\nprompt, while visual cues can benefit the agent to\ngenerate feedbacks; (b) a text-only driven agent of-\nten finds it difficult to produce intuitive feedback\nthat humans can easily understand.\nDeveloping embodied agents that can adapt\nto the open world has long been a sub-\nstantial challenge (Kolve et al., 2017; Savva\net al., 2019).\nRecently, the rapid progress\nof large language models (LLMs) (OpenAI,\n2022; Touvron et al., 2023a) has shown their\npotential to serve as a general-purpose assis-\ntant. Driven by these pre-trained LLMs, re-\ncently proposed agents (Yuan et al., 2023;\nWang et al., 2023a;b; Zhu et al., 2023) have\nmanaged to extract world knowledge and rea-\nsoning capabilities from LLMs, allowing them\nto become self-driven. Thereby these agents\nare capable of generating executable policies\nor plans for a wide range of skills and tasks in\nan open-ended world.\nWhile current attempts to integrate LLMs\nshow promise in developing a generic embod-\nied agent, these efforts primarily translate the\nentire world into text, which overlooks the\n†Corresponding author\n1\narXiv:2310.13255v2  [cs.CV]  7 Dec 2023\nPreprint\nmultifaceted richness of diverse visual reality\nand turns interacting with the environment into something akin to “a blindfolded text-based game.”\nConsequently, such text-only agents often face difficulties when it comes to effectively and intu-\nitively representing the world. Imagine a situation where you request your agent to shop for a pair\nof shoes. Would you prefer to send the agent a picture of the shoes or provide a lengthy description\nof the shoes to convey their appearance? Undoubtedly, you would opt for the former choice.\nIn fact, the agent’s reliance on text input\/output (I\/O) imposes significant limitations on its ability to\ninteract with the world. To illustrate this point, we consider Minecraft (Guss et al., 2019; Fan et al.,\n2022) as an ideal example. Minecraft, being an expansive sandbox game, offers a vast realm for\nembodied agents to explore, which requires the acquisition of various basic skills (e.g., crafting logs)\nand the ability to plan and execute diverse tasks. First, as shown in Figure 1 (a), the LLM-based agent\nproduces uncontrollable outputs. The success of the agent’s responses hinges heavily on careful\nprompt engineering (Huang et al., 2022b), ensuring that the LLM comprehends the environment\nand task objectives. Moreover, a universally applicable prompt that suits every LLM and task is an\nunattainable goal. Therefore, this prompting process is labor-intensive and contradicts our aim of\nenabling agents to act in a self-driven manner. Second, when compared to visual feedback, language\noften encounters difficulties in intuitively conveying specific world concepts (e.g., recipes) to users,\nas illustrated in Figure 1 (b), thereby unavoidably creating obstacles for robust human-computer\/AI\ninteraction (Preece et al., 1994; Fallman, 2003).\nUnlike LLMs, humans possess an innate ability to process and generate information through both\nvisual and text channels. This inherent gift significantly enhances our capability to interact with\nthe world. However, the coupling of LLM-based agents with multimodal I\/O has been relatively\nunderexplored in an open-ended environment. To fill this gap, we introduce Steve-Eye\n, a large\nmultimodal model that enables LLM-based embodied agents to engage with the open world via\nvisual-text interfaces. Steve-Eye excels at producing responses that demonstrate a comprehensive\ngrasp of the environment, common-sense reasoning, and executable skill plans. To achieve this,\nSteve-Eye is equipped with three indispensable functions: (1) multimodal perception; (2) founda-\ntional knowledge base; and (3) skill prediction and planning. In this paper, we choose Minecraft as\nour validation platform considering its vast sandbox world and the high degree of freedom. More\nenvironments can also be considered, e.g., Virtual Home (Puig et al., 2018), AI2THOR (Kolve\net al., 2017). Due to the space limit, we discuss the exploration of more generic environments in\nAppendix A.4 and leave it as our future work. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\nOpen-World Instruction Dataset.\nWe construct an extensive instruction dataset to train Steve-\nEye for the acquisition of three mentioned functions. The instruction data contains not only the\nagent’s per-step status and environmental features but also the essential knowledge for agents to act\nand plan. However, collecting such a dataset in an open world can be a costly endeavor, especially\nwhen aiming to gather fine-grained and diverse labels. As a result, previous studies (Fan et al.,\n2022) have often relied on readily available unsupervised data (e.g., video-subtitle pairs) for pre-\ntraining. In these approaches, the agent’s comprehension of its status and environment is implicitly\nlearned through self-supervised techniques, while its foundational knowledge is directly derived\nfrom general-purpose LLMs. In contrast, our work involves curating multimodal instructional data\nspecifically designed for open-ended embodied agents, by utilizing ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022).\nLarge Multimodal Model and Training.\nSteve-Eye combines a visual encoder which converts\nvisual inputs into a sequence of embeddings, along with a pre-trained LLM which empowers em-\nbodied agents to engage in skill or task reasoning in an open world. During the training process, we\nemploy a two-stage strategy similar to Liu et al. (2023). This strategy commences with the align-\nment of multimodal elements between the visual encoder and the large language model, followed\nby the instruction tuning through our constructed dataset.\nOpen-World Benchmarks.\nWe carry out extensive experiments to demonstrate that our pro-\nposed Steve-Eye outperforms LLM-based agents in open-world setups. Specifically, we develop the\nfollowing benchmarks to evaluate agent performance from a broad range of perspectives: (1) envi-\nronmental visual captioning (ENV-VC), which assesses an agent’s capacity to perceive and describe\nits surroundings effectively; (2) foundational knowledge question answering (FK-QA), which eval-\nuates the proficiency in mastering basic knowledge crucial for an agent’s decision-making; (3) skill\nprediction and planning (SPP), which quantifies an agent’s capability to act and plan strategically.\n2\nPreprint\n2\nRELATED WORK\n2.1\nOPEN-WORLD EMBODIED AGENTS WITH LLMS\nThe rapid progress of large language models (Brown et al., 2020; Raffel et al., 2020; Zhang et al.,\n2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022) has significantly boosted their capacity to encode a wide range of\nhuman behaviors within training data (Bommasani et al., 2021). When equipped with narrowly de-\nsigned prompts, LLM-based agents exhibit the capability to generate executable plans for tasks such\nas indoor robot manipulation. For instance, SayCan (Ahn et al., 2022) integrates skill affordances\nwith LLMs to yield actionable plans, while Palm-E (Driess et al., 2023) takes a step further by\nconstructing hierarchical agents capable of handling multimodal prompts. This approach has also\nproven its efficacy in open-world environments (Huang et al., 2022a; Li et al., 2022). In contrast\nto robot manipulation, agents in the wild require a heightened level of real-time situational aware-\nness and foundational knowledge to execute intricate skill plans across a diverse array of tasks. To\nsimulate human behaviors in such open worlds, Generative Agents (Park et al., 2023) store agents’\nexperiences and retrieve these memories to generate plans in a text-based sandbox game.\nIn recent years, the 3D sandbox Minecraft has received considerable attention owing to its remark-\nably flexible game mechanics to serve as a prominent open-world benchmark (e.g., MineRL (Guss\net al., 2019) and Minedojo (Fan et al., 2022)). DEPS (Wang et al., 2023b) introduces the descrip-\ntor, explainer, and selector for plan generation with the help of LLM. Plan4MC (Yuan et al., 2023)\nconstructs a skill graph and proposes a skill search algorithm to minimize planning errors. Voy-\nager (Wang et al., 2023a) proposes an LLM-powered lifelong learning agent that continually ex-\nplores the Minecraft world. Similar to (Park et al., 2023), GITM (Zhu et al., 2023) integrates LLMs\nwith text-based memory and knowledge to create generic agents in Minecraft. Among these studies,\nVoyager (Wang et al., 2023a) and GITM (Zhu et al., 2023) lean entirely on text descriptions of the\nenvironment to act and plan, while Plan4MC (Yuan et al., 2023) and DEPS (Wang et al., 2023b)\nhave visual-input skills but still rely on merely text for planning. None of them try to understand the\nrich visual observation provided natively by Minecraft. In contrast to these works, our work trains a\nlarge multimodal model to fill this gap.\n2.2\nLARGE MULTIMODAL MODELS (LMMS)\nIn comparison to LLMs, large multimodal models (LMMs) (Awadalla et al., 2023) encompass\na broad range of information beyond text modality, which can be categorized into two primary\nstreams. The first category (Gupta & Kembhavi, 2023; Huang et al., 2023a; Patil et al., 2023; Sur´ıs\net al., 2023) involves hinging on ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) or GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) to generate\nin-context responses without parameter tuning. However, these approaches heavily rely on the avail-\nability of an LLM’s API and the quality of the designed prompts. The second category comprises\nend-to-end pre-trained models. Within this category, models such as Huang et al. (2023b); Peng et al.\n(2023) are trained entirely from scratch. Conversely, some research explores efficient fine-tuning us-\ning pre-trained LLMs by incorporating lightweight modality encoders, such as Qformer (Li et al.,\n2023) or Perceiver (Alayrac et al., 2022). Recently, Liu et al. (2023) propose to explicitly instruction-\ntune a LLM using vision-language instruction data.\nIn this work, we propose Steve-Eye by building upon pre-trained LLMs, aiming to develop an open-\nworld agent powered by a large-scale model with versatile multimodal I\/O capabilities.\n3\nMETHODOLOGY\nIn this section, we first provide our instruction-following dataset to develop three key functions for\nthe agent’s open-world interaction in Section 3.1. We then propose our large multimodal agent\nSteve-Eye in Section 3.2, and clarify details of the training procedure in Section 3.3. We adopt\nMinecraft as our open-ended platform in this paper to collect data and validate the model, anticipat-\ning to explore a broader range of environments for Steve-Eye in future studies.\nTo empower an agent with the self-driven capacity to act and plan in an open world, we posit that the\nfollowing embodied functions are indispensable: (1) multimodal perception function which offers\na detailed description of the agent status and environmental features; (2) foundational knowledge\n3\nPreprint\nbase which imparts an understanding of how the world works and conveys crucial basic knowledge\nrelated to skills and tasks; (3) skill prediction and planning which is responsible for generating\nskill execution feedback (e.g., success or failure) and crafting high-level skill plans for handling\nmore complex and long-horizon tasks. We develop these functions by building the corresponding\ninstruction dataset to pre-train Steve-Eye as follows.\n3.1\nOPEN-WORLD INSTRUCTION-FOLLOWING DATASET\nMultimodal Perception Instructions.\nHuman players can perform actions in Minecraft mainly\nrelying on their visual perception, without any prior hints or imposed game judgments. In order to\nendow Steve-Eye with the same ability, it is required to provide it with comprehensive visual descrip-\ntions of the environment. To achieve this, we use Minedojo (Fan et al., 2022) to obtain Minecraft\nsnapshots which contain a wide array of details within the agent’s surroundings, including environ-\nmental features, the agent’s life and food status, inventory items, and equipment, as illustrated in\nFigure 2. In addition, we leverage MaskCLIP (Zhou et al., 2022) to identify the in-sight objects of\nthese snapshots without supervised annotations. During our data collection process, for each snap-\nshot I and its corresponding description XC, we initiate a three-step approach. Firstly, we prompt\nChatGPT to curate a list of 40 instructions as shown in Figure 6 in Appendix A.1.1. Then we enrich\nsnapshot details as dense caption to describe its content, with the assistance of ChatGPT. Finally,\nwe select an instruction XQ randomly from the list and combine it with the snapshot’s caption to\ncreate a single-round multimodal description pair (e.g., ### Human: XQ I\\n ### Embodied Agent:\nXC\\n.). By doing so, we collect 200K instructional pairs for multimodal perception learning.\n[Description] Steve is walking in the forest and\nhe can’t see the sky. There are trees in front of\nhim. He still has 20.0 life and 20.0 food. He is\nnow equipped with the iron pickaxe and the\ninventory contains 5 pickaxes, 6 ……\n•\nenvironment\n•\nlife and food\n•\nobject in sight\n•\ninventory and \nequipment\nFigure 2. Multimodal perception\nFoundational Knowledge Instructions.\nEmbodied agents\nrequire a foundation of essential knowledge to facilitate action-\ntaking and skill planning.\nIn Minecraft, such knowledge\nshould contain item recipes, details of item attributes, their as-\nsociated numerical value, etc. We access this vital information\nfrom Minecraft-Wiki (Fandom, 2023), which comprises an ex-\ntensive collection of over 9,000 HTML pages. To be specific,\nwe first obtain all item icons from Minecraft-Wiki and gener-\nate 200K icon inventory images, as illustrated in Figure 3 (a).\nEach icon image corresponds to a 4-row table with an associ-\nated caption adhering to a standardized template: “There is a\nMinecraft inventory with 4 rows. From left to right, they are\n...”. As shown in Figuire 7 in Appendix A.1.2, we curate a set of 20 distinct prompts designed to\nchallenge the model’s ability to recognize items. Subsequently, we further collect all recipe-related\ninformation from the Wiki as illustrated in Figure 3 (b), and design similar prompt templates to for-\nmulate 10,000 recipe-image instructional pairs. Lastly, we process the Wiki and utilize this corpus\nto produce 40,000 single-round question-answer pairs. In total, we collect a high-quality dataset\nwith 250K foundational knowledge instructions.\n(a) Item icons\n(b) recipes\nFigure 3. Icons and recipes\nSkill-related Interaction Instructions.\nThe environmen-\ntal description and foundational knowledge serve as prerequi-\nsites for an agent’s interaction within the open world. How-\never, a successful interaction requires more than these ele-\nments alone. It relies upon the mastery of basic skills, such\nas log, harvesting, and food preparation, as well as high-level\nskill planning abilities to tackle complex, long-horizon tasks,\nsuch as crafting an iron pickaxe. To facilitate this, we gather\ncorresponding training data for skill prediction and planning,\nwhich enables our model to provide correct feedback on both\nbasic skills and long-horizon tasks across a spectrum of agent\nor environmental conditions. Specifically, the data collection\nprocess involves two steps. First, we sample skill trajecto-\nries based on the pre-trained basic skill policies and collect\n200K snapshot pairs with corresponding statuses from these\ntrajectories. Each snapshot pair {I0, It} denotes the 0-th and\nt-th timestamp of the skill trajectory. Next, we employ Chat-\nGPT to generate question-answer pairs about diverse aspects of skill execution status. These ques-\n4\nPreprint\nHow to craft a wooden axe? \nAnswer me via a recipe image.\nWhat are the ingredients required \nto craft a detector rail?\nProvide a detailed description of \nthe given Minecraft image <image>. \n…\n…\n<image> \nMake a plan list to finish the task \nof <image> in Minecraft. \n<image> \nIron Ingot, Stone Pressure \nPlate, and Redstone Dust.\nFrom left to right, there are 1 \nshears in the inventory, which \nmeans he is equipped with 1 \nshears.

Illustration of Steve-Eye: a large multimodal model designed to seamlessly process both\nvisual and language inputs. Steve-Eye excels in acquiring fundamental knowledge of the world it\nlives in, understanding the nuances of its surroundings, and generating executable plans to complete\na wide array of open-ended tasks. Furthermore, Steve-Eye responds to user instructions through\neither visual or text-based cues, enhancing the convenience and flexibility of human-AI interaction.\ntions delve into whether the agent completes the skill, encounters unexpected failures, or seeks\nexplanations for such failures. More details can be found in Appendix A.1.3. Second, we sam-\nple 40K task trajectories using the planner in Yuan et al. (2023), each of which can be denoted as\nT = {s1, s2, ...sT} representing the task is finished via a T-round planning procedure, where si is\nthe skill plan for i-th round. At each round i, we feed our model with its start snapshot and task\ninitialization, and curate instructional questions to inquire about si with reasonable explanation. In\nthis manner, we obtain 200K instructional pairs from task trajectories.\n3.2\nMODEL ARCHITECTURE\nFigure 4 illustrates the overall architecture of our proposed model. Steve-Eye, functioning as a\ngenerative model, connects an image-oriented tokenizer fv with the pre-trained LLM backbone Θ.\nWe adopt the image tokenizer, e.g., VQ-GAN (Esser et al., 2021), to encode the raw images I into\ntoken embeddings V = {v1, v2, ..., vn} ∈Rn×d, where n denotes the number of visual tokens and\nd is the dimensionality of each token. We further utilize a lightweight projection module fl with\na trainable projection matrix W. This module maps the visual tokens to the same space with text\nembeddings, yielding ˆV = {ˆv1, ˆv2, ..., ˆvn} ∈Rn× ˆd:\n  \\ hat  {\\ma t h cal {V}} = W \\mathcal {V}; \\hspace {0.3em} \\text {where} \\hspace {0.3em} \\mathcal {V} = f_v(I). \n(1)\nTo effectively process visual-language inputs and generate corresponding outputs, our model inte-\ngrates the visual codebook Cv into the pre-existing language vocabulary Cl. This integration leads\nto the formation of a unified multimodal codebook, denoted as Cm = Cv ∪Cl. Additionally, in\norder to mark the starting and ending points of visual elements in I\/O sequences, we introduce two\nspecial tokens, namely <vis> and <\/vis>. The LLM backbone Θ of our Steve-Eye is built upon a\ndecoder-only architecture with casual transformers. Our model employs an auto-regressive predic-\ntion mechanism, generating responses based on the provided multimodal input tokens. The resulting\nresponse is a mixed sequence of visual and textual tokens, represented as Y = {y1, y2, ..., ym}. For\neach embedding yi, we pass it through a linear layer fp followed by a softmax operation, mapping\nit into a probability distribution of the multimodal vocabulary. The final prediction for the i-th token\nzi is determined by selecting the token from the multimodal codebook with the highest score:\n  z _i = \\argmax ( \\text {softmax}(f_p(y_i))). \n(2)\n3.3\nTRAINING\nEach instruction-following instance can be formulated as a multi-round conversation {X 1\nQ, X 1\nC, ...,\nX N\nQ , X N\nC }, where each {X i\nQ, X i\nC} represents a question-answer interaction between a human and\n5\nPreprint\nthe embodied agent and N indicates the total number of rounds in the conversation. The entire\ninstructional dataset follows this unified template, as demonstrated in Figure 11 in Appendix A.1.3.\nTo efficiently train our model, we employ the negative log-likelihood objective over the prediction\ntokens with instruction tuning:\n  \\m a t\nh\nc\nal \n{L} (\\Theta )=-\\sum _{j=1}^{L} \\log P_{\\Theta }(y_j|\\mathcal {I}, \\hat {y}_{1:j-1}), \n(3)\nwhere y and ˆy respectively denote the input and target token sequences, with Θ representing the\nmodel parameters, and L representing the length of the target sequence. The input visual content\nI may represent an empty image depending on the input instruction. It is worth noting that we\nconstrain the loss computation to only consider the answer tokens XC. This constraint prevents\ntraining from becoming excessively straightforward and ensures that the model’s primary focus is\non learning to precisely generate coherent responses. Similar to Liu et al. (2023), we adopt a two-\nstage instruction-tuning strategy to train our model:\nTwo-Stage Instruction-Tuning. (1) Multimodal feature alignment: In the first stage, our pri-\nmary objective is to align visual features with the language token space. In order to strike a bal-\nance between efficient tuning and a comprehensive coverage of the world’s concepts, we curate our\nopen-ended instruction dataset to 600K snapshot-text pairs. These pairs are then transformed into\ninstruction-following data as described in Section 3.1. During the feature alignment stage, we main-\ntain the visual encoder and the LLM parameters in a frozen state, exclusively training the projection\nmodule. Additionally, this training phase involves fine-tuning token embeddings to accommodate\nthe newly introduced visual codebook and two special tokens <vis> and <\/vis>. (2) End-to-end\ninstruction tuning: In the second stage, we continue to keep the visual encoder frozen while concur-\nrently training the projection module and LLM. This second stage leverages the entire open-ended\ninstructions and contributes significantly to enhancing the model’s capability of comprehending and\neffectively responding to complex multimodal instructions.\n4\nEXPERIMENTS\n4.1\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nImplementation Details.\nIn this paper, we use the LLaMA-2 model (Touvron et al., 2023b)\nas the LLM backbone. Additionally, we use CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) as our visual encoder\nto achieve the best performance for non-visual generative tasks, and use VQ-GAN (Esser et al.,\n2021) as the default visual tokenizer for visual generation. The size of visual codebook Cv and\nlanguage vocabulary is 8192 and 32000, respectively. In addition, we add <vis> and <\/vis> to the\nfinal unified codebook, indicating the starting and ending points of visual content. Similar to Liu\net al. (2023), we construct 850K instruction-answer pairs for model training. Note that the model\nis trained to predict the agent’s answer, and thus only sequence\/tokens of answer will be used to\ncompute the loss in the auto-regressive model. We also adopt LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) to reduce the\ncomputational cost for efficient tuning. We choose MineDojo (Fan et al., 2022) as the Minecraft\nplatform to collect our instruction data and conduct experiments. Following Yuan et al. (2023),\nwe use the environments of programmatic tasks to train basic policies with RL. These policies are\ntrained to execute corresponding skills and keep fixed in all testing tasks.\nEvaluation Benchmarks.\nWe conduct experiments on three benchmarks to evaluate an agent’s\ninteraction ability in an open world. (1) Environmental visual captioning (ENV-VC): given a\nsnapshot, the model is asked to describe the agent’s current status and environmental features from\ndiverse aspects (e.g., life, food...). We evaluate the prediction’s accuracy of each aspect by ex-\ntracting corresponding answers from the output description to compare with the groundtruth. (2)\nFoundational knowledge question answering (FK-QA): to assess the model’s grasp of essential\nknowledge, we collect a set of 10,000 Minecraft-related questions from different sources, including\nthe Wiki pages, Wiki tables, and Minecraft recipes. The performance is measured by the model’s\nability to provide correct answers to these questions. (3) Skill prediction and planning (SPP): we\nutilize our proposed Steve-Eye to predict whether a skill has been successfully completed and assert\nits capability to generate executable high-level skill plans for long-horizon tasks.\n6\nPreprint\nTable 1.

These six questions pertain to the prediction of various aspects, including\ninventory items\n, equipment\n, objects in sight\n, life\n, food\n, and the visibility of sky\n.\nDuring the inference phase, Steve-Eye predicts answers based on these questions and the input\nsnapshot. Experimental results are presented in Table 1 and Table 2. As shown in Table 1, our\nvisual encoder, when combined with multimodal instruction tuning, significantly enables the ability\nof the text-only language model LLM (Llama-2-7b) to comprehend the contents of the snapshots\n(Steve-Eye-7b). Notably, Steve-Eye outperforms BLIP-2 by a substantial margin due to the im-\nproved reasoning ability enabled by the larger LLM. Furthermore, the visual encoder plays a crucial\nrole in facilitating multimodal understanding. Surprisingly, the model equipped with CLIP (Radford\net al., 2021) surpasses the performance of the model using MineCLIP (Fan et al., 2022), achieving\nover +48.9%, +21.0% and +19.9% improvements in inventory, equipment, and object-in-sight pre-\ndictions, respectively. We attribute this performance difference to the fact that MineCLIP does not\nprioritize fine-grained alignment during pre-training, despite being exposed to a diverse range of\nMinecraft videos. In summary, Steve-Eye’s ability to comprehend visual cues from its surroundings\nlays the foundation for subsequent interactions with the world.\nTo investigate the effictiveness of various types of instructional data for multimodal perception, we\ncarry out experimental comparisons with diverse data configurations in Table 2. First, our results\nshowcase a significant improvement in the model’s capacity to respond to instructional questions\nthrough instruction tuning, which leads to impressive gains of over +50% for inventory, equipment,\nand object-in-sight prediction. Furthermore, the inclusion of the multimodal perception dataset and\nicon images in the training data both contribute to a substantial improvement in the model’s overall\nperformance. Ultimately, the best results are achieved when combining all available data sources.\n4.3\nFOUDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE QUESTION ANSWERING (FK-QA)\nFollowing Team (2022), we establish a question database specialized to assess our model’s pro-\nficiency in generating responses pertaining to fundamental Minecraft knowledge. This evaluation\nis carried out through a validation dataset known as the FK-QA test set, which is further divided\ninto two distinct subsets: TEXT and IMG. In the FK-QA TEXT subset, we generate a collection\nof 10,000 question-answer pairs curated from various sources, including the Minecraft-Wiki pages,\nMinecraft-Wiki tables, and Minecraft recipes. Each category comprises 2,000, 5,000, and 3,000\npairs, respectively. Upon receiving a response from Steve-Eye, we feed both the generated response\n7\nPreprint\nTable 3. Comparisons on FK-QA test set of the foundational knowledge question answering bench-\nmark.

ChatGPT will first examine the accuracy of\nthe response as a measure of answer correctness. To minimize variability in error, ChatGPT con-\nducts a further evaluation, considering the response’s accuracy, relevance, and level of detail. This\ncomprehensive evaluation yields an overall score on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, where a higher\nscore signifies superior overall performance. In the FK-QA IMG subset, we shift our focus to visual\ngeneration by employing 3,000 recipe images as groundtruth data. Here, our model is tasked with\ngenerating visual outputs for each item within the recipe inventory, following a specific order. The\nvisual output is considered correct only if every element of the recipe is accurately generated. We\nadopt this metric to assert our model’s ability to produce multimodal feedback.\nTable 3 presents both scoring and accuracy results. It’s worthy to note that Llama-2 exhibits consis-\ntent performance regardless of the model’s scale, with Llama-2-70b only marginally outperforming\nthe 7b-version by +1.26% in accuracy, meanwhile 13b-version performs even worse than 7b-version\non the scoring results. We hypothesize that this phenomenon can be attributed to distinct variations\nin difficulty levels encountered within our FK-QA test set. Llama-2 fails to answer correctly for the\nchallenging part regardless of its size due to essential knowledge missing. In contrast, Steve-Eye\noutperforms both Llama-2 and gpt-turbo-3.5, despite its considerably smaller scale. Furthermore,\nour model exhibits a more substantial improvement in responding to Recipe and Wiki Table ques-\ntions as compared to Wiki Page questions. This disparity can likely be attributed to the fact that\nWiki Page contains a large proportion of invalid questions (e.g., version, history), whereas Recipe\nand Wiki Table predominantly feature knowledge-related inquiries. Such result further validates the\neffectiveness of our approach in acquiring foundational knowledge. Unlike text-only LLMs, our\nmodel exhibits considerable ability to output visual contents, which achieves 65.13% accuracy on\nFK-QA IMG using the 13b-version. The multimodal generation ability enables Steve-Eye to better\nserve as an assistant for potential needed people such as beginners of this game. We show more\ndetails and cases in Appendix A.3.\n4.4\nSKILL PREDICTION AND PLANNING (SPP)\nSkill Prediction.\nSimilar to Section 3.1, we collect another 20K snapshot pairs in the form of\n{I0, It} from skill trajectories (referred to as Skill-Pred test). These pairs are input into our model\nto query the current execution status of the skill. The execution status can fall into one of three cate-\ngories: success, failure, and running, with “running” signifying that the skill is currently in progress.\nTable 4.\nRecall\/Accuracy results on Skill-Pred\ntest set for the skill prediction benchmark.\nrunning (%) success (%)\nfail (%)\nBLIP-2\n65.2\/58.8\n49.8\/54.3\n42.1\/51.8\nSteve-Eye-7b\n89.8\/82.5\n77.6\/81.4\n74.2\/79.9\nSteve-Eye-13b\n92.1\/84.2\n80.5\/83.1\n76.8\/81.5\nAs shown in Table 4, our model exhibits com-\nmendable performance in skill status predic-\ntion.\nHowever, the performance is still far\nfrom enough to completely replace the rule-\nbased game judgment adopted by the existing\nRL-based skill agents. These experiments indi-\ncate that, despite the excellent multimodal un-\nderstanding capabilities of our model in open-\nworld environments in previous experiments, it\nstill falls short in fine-grained reasoning tasks that involve consecutive frames to some extent.\nSkill Planning.\nFollowing Yuan et al. (2023), we carry out evaluation on 24 difficult tasks in\nMinecraft. These tasks can be categorized into three types: cutting trees to craft primary items (7),\nmining cobblestones to craft advanced items (7), and interacting with mobs to harvest food and ma-\nterials (10). Each task is tested for 30 episodes, where an episode refers to a multi-round interaction\n8\nPreprint\nTable 5. Comparisons on the skill planning benchmark. We test the mean success rates of all tasks,\nwhere each task is executed for 30 episodes using the same seeds for initialization.\nModel\nMineAgent\n0.00\n0.03\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.21\n0.0\n0.05\n0.0\ngpt assistant\n0.30\n0.17\n0.07\n0.00\n0.03\n0.00\n0.20\n0.00\n0.20\n0.03\n0.13\n0.00\n0.10\n0.00\nSteve-Eye-auto\n0.30\n0.27\n0.37\n0.23\n0.20\n0.17\n0.26\n0.07\n0.13\n0.17\n0.20\n0.33\n0.00\n0.13\nSteve-Eye\n0.40\n0.30\n0.43\n0.53\n0.33\n0.37\n0.43\n0.30\n0.43\n0.47\n0.47\n0.40\n0.13\n0.23\nModel\nMineAgent\n0.46\n0.50\n0.33\n0.35\n0.0\n0.0\n0.06\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\ngpt assistant\n0.57\n0.76\n0.43\n0.30\n0.00\n0.00\n0.37\n0.00\n0.03\n0.00\nSteve-Eye-auto\n0.70\n0.63\n0.40\n0.30\n0.17\n0\n0.37\n0.03\n0.07\n0.00\nSteve-Eye\n0.73\n0.67\n0.47\n0.33\n0.23\n0.07\n0.43\n0.10\n0.17\n0.07\nprocess. At each round, the model receives the environmental feedback from the last round, plans\na skill list based on the current status, and then picks up the top skill to execute. For each task\nepisode, we set a maximum step between [3000, 10000]. In our evaluation, we compare Steve-Eye\nagainst two baseline approaches: (1) MineAgent (Fan et al., 2022), which completes tasks without\ndecomposing them into basic skills, and uses PPO and self-imitation learning with CLIP reward,\nand (2) GPT Assistant, which employs ChatGPT as a high-level planner to generate skill plans by\nprompting itself with information from the environment and the agent’s status. The results in Ta-\nble 5 demonstrate that Steve-Eye significantly outperforms both baseline methods. Additionally, we\nconduct experiments in which Steve-Eye takes over the skill prediction function from the rule-based\ngame judgment in Minecraft. This self-driven variant is referred to as ‘Steve-Eye-auto.’ Since the\nmodel’s skill prediction is not always 100% accurate, Steve-Eye-auto does experience some perfor-\nmance degradation when compared to Steve-Eye. This degradation is more pronounced in longer,\ncomplex tasks (e.g.,\n,\n,\n) as opposed to short-term tasks (e.g.,\n,\n,\n). Nevertheless,\nSteve-Eye-auto still demonstrates significant performance improvements in most tasks, compared to\nthe baselines. For additional details about this benchmark, please refer to Appendix A.2.\nFor better visualization, we provide a qualitative example of Steve-Eye completing the task “crafting\nstone axe with wooden pickaxe” as shown in Figure 5.\nfind cobblestone\nharvest cobblestone\nfind trees\nharvest log\ncraft planks\ncraft and place table\ncraft stone axe\nbirthplace\nFigure 5. Snapshots of a qualitative example, illustrating how Steve-Eye completes the task of\n“crafting a stone axe with a wooden pickaxe.” Our model generates a skill plan at each interaction\nround and selects the top skill from the plan list for execution.\n5\nCONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we explore enabling a large multimodal model to serve as a generative embodied\nagent in open worlds. We achieve this goal by proposing Steve-Eye, which combines the text-only\nlanguage model with a visual encoder, allowing for a multimodal I\/O interface to interact with the\nenvironment. With the help of ChatGPT, we curate questions to generate 850K instruction-following\ndata to facilitate the agent’s multimodal perception fuction, foundational knowledge mastery, as well\nas the capability of skill prediction and planning. Experiments on three open-world benchmarks\nverify the advantages of our Steve-Eye over a wide range of perspectives.\n9\nPreprint\nREFERENCES\nMichael Ahn, Anthony Brohan, Noah Brown, Yevgen Chebotar, Omar Cortes, Byron David, Chelsea\nFinn, Chuyuan Fu, Keerthana Gopalakrishnan, Karol Hausman, et al.

Furthermore, we delve into the skill planning benchmark and its associ-\nated task setups in Appendix A.2. In Appendix A.3 we present qualitative cases that illustrate our\nmodel’s ability to provide intuitive visual feedback and serve as an intelligent chatbot with a multi-\nmodal input-output interface. Finally, we explore the potential applications of our model in diverse\nenvironments, such as Virtual Home (Puig et al., 2018).\nA.1\nDATASET\nA.1.1\nMULTIMODAL PERCEPTION INSTRUCTIONS\nThis dataset contains 200K instructional pairs. Figure 6 illustrates a partial listing of instructional\nquestions employed for describing the content of the Minecraft snapshots. These instructions convey\nsimilar meanings, albeit with slight variations in natural language.\n•\n\"Describe the following Minecraft image in detail\",\n•\n\"Provide a detailed description of the given Minecraft image\",\n•\n\"Give an elaborate explanation of the Minecraft game image you see\",\n•\n\"Share a comprehensive rundown of the presented Minecraft image\",\n•\n\"Offer a thorough analysis of the Minecraft frame\",\n•\n\"Explain the various aspects of the Minecraft image before you\",\n•\n\"Examine the Minecraft image closely and share its details\",\n•\n\"Write an exhaustive depiction of the given Minecraft image“\n•\n\"Clarify the contents of the displayed Minecraft image with great detail\",\n•\n\"Narrate the contents of the Minecraft image with precision\"\nFigure 6. 10 instruction examples for multimodal perception instructions.\nA.1.2\nFOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE INSTRUCTIONS\nThe dataset comprises 250K training instances, which is organized into three distinct subsets: 200K\nicon image instructions, 10K recipe image instructions, and 40K Minecraft-Wiki corpus instructions.\nFor the icon images, we generate questions aimed at prompting the model to recognize and describe\nitem icons within the inventory, as depicted in Figure 7. Similarly, we curate instructional questions\nfor recipe images as shown in Figure 8, with the objective of extracting information on completing\nspecific recipes. In addition, we preprocess the raw Minecraft-Wiki HTML pages by removing\nirrelevant information (e.g., reference links) and unresolved data, transforming the raw corpus into\na formatted, clean Markdown version. Leveraging the capabilities of ChatGPT, we employ this\npowerful language model to generate 10 questions, each with its corresponding answer, for every\npage of the cleaned Wiki corpus. This process yields a collection of 40K single-round question-\nanswer pairs, which can be utilized for instruction tuning.\n13\nPreprint\n•\n\"Provide a brief description of the given recipe image.\"\n•\n\"Offer a succinct explanation of the recipe picture presented.\"\n•\n\"Summarize the recipe content about icons of the image.\"\n•\n\"Give a short and clear explanation of the subsequent recipe image.\"\n•\n\"Share a concise interpretation of the recipe image provided.\"\n•\n\"Present a compact recipe description of the photo's key features.\"\n•\n\"Relay a brief, clear account of the recipe picture shown.\"\n•\n\"Render a clear and concise recipe summary of the photo.\"\n•\n\"Write a terse but informative recipe summary of the picture.\"\n•\n\"Create an icon narrative representing the recipe image presented.\"\nFigure 8. 10 instruction examples of recipe image for foundational knowledge instructions.\n•\n\"Clarify the contents of the displayed inventory image with great attention to detail.“\n•\n\"Characterize the inventory image with a meticulously detailed description.“\n•\n\"Break down the individual slot elements within the inventory image with precision.“\n•\n\"Take a step-by-step journey through the important details of the Minecraft inventory image.“\n•\n\"Paint a vivid and descriptive narrative of the Minecraft inventory image.“\n•\n\"Provide a precise narration of the contents within the Minecraft inventory image.“\n•\n\"Thoroughly analyze the Minecraft inventory image in a comprehensive and detailed manner.“\n•\n\"Illustrate the Minecraft inventory image through a descriptive and informative explanation.“\n•\n\"Examine the Minecraft inventory image closely and share its intricate details.“\n•\n\"Compose an exhaustive depiction of the given Minecraft inventory image.\"\nFigure 7. 10 instruction examples of icon images for foundational knowledge instructions.\nA.1.3\nSKILL-RELATED INTERACTION INSTRUCTIONS\nFor skill prediction, we utilize the skill policies trained by Yuan et al. (2023) to create a dataset\ncomprising 200K skill trajectories. In each trajectory, we extract timestamps from the initial and\nt-th points to generate a snapshot pair, denoted as {I0, It}. We then construct questions aimed at\ndetermining whether the agent successfully executed the skill or, in the case of failure, identifying\nthe underlying reasons for the unsuccessful attempt. Illustrative examples of these skill prediction\nquestions are provided in Figure 9. We also provide examples with snapshot pairs in Figure 10.\n14\nPreprint\n•\n\"\"Steve is demonstrating his proficiency in {SKILL_NAME}, with the objective of achieving {SKILL_DEFINITION}. We'll now assess \nboth the initial and current frames to determine if he has successfully executed the skill and the reasons behind it:\"\n•\n\"\"The skill Steve is performing is {SKILL_NAME}, and its intended outcome is to {SKILL_DEFINITION}. To determine whether Steve \nhas accomplished this skill, we need to analyze both the starting and current frames:“\n•\n\"\"Steve is currently engaged in executing {SKILL_NAME}, aiming to achieve {SKILL_DEFINITION}. In order to evaluate his success in \nperforming this skill, we'll examine both the initial frame and the current frame:“\n•\n\"\"The task at hand for Steve involves mastering {SKILL_NAME}, with the ultimate goal of accomplishing {SKILL_DEFINITION}. To \nascertain whether he has successfully completed this skill, we'll analyze both the starting and current frames:“\n•\n\"\"Steve is in the process of mastering the art of {SKILL_NAME}, with the specific objective of accomplishing {SKILL_DEFINITION}.\nWe will now evaluate whether Steve has successfully executed this skill by comparing the initial and current frames:“\n•\n\"\"The skill that Steve is currently executing is {SKILL_NAME}, and the intended outcome is {SKILL_DEFINITION}.

Illustrative examples of skill prediction instruction data with snapshot pairs.\nTemplate of Instructional Training Data. Similar to Liu et al. (2023), we formulate each instruc-\ntional instance as a multi-round conversation as shown in Figure 11, where Xhead message is a sentence\nto describe this assistant (e.g., “ You are in a chat between a curious human and an artificial intelli-\ngence assistant. You should serve as an assistant to give helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the\nhuman’s questions.”). The number of rounds relies on the input instruction content. And the input\nimages (denoted as < image >) will only be fed in the first round, while XC may contain visual\noutputs with two additional tokens < vis > and < \/vis >.\n15\nPreprint\nFigure 11. The unified template to generate input sequence for instructional tuning.\nA.2\nSKILL PLANNING BENCHMARK\nTo clarify this benchmark, we begin by offering comprehensive task setup details in Table 6. During\nthe evaluation phase, we relocate the agent to a random location at the initiation of every episode,\nwith distances of up to 500 units, ensuring that the agent spawns in an unfamiliar environment. Fur-\nthermore, for tasks that involve interacting with mobs, we enforce a maximum spawning distance of\n30 units for cows and sheep. Our approach to complete tasks is rooted in a hierarchical framework.\nSpecifically, our model exclusively generates high-level skill plans, delegating the actual skill exe-\ncution to pre-trained basic skill policies as introduced by Yuan et al. (2023). Notably, we introduce\na self-driven variant named ’Steve-Eye-auto,’ which serves not only as a planner but also replaces\nthe Minecraft rules to verify the successful execution of skills.\nTable 6. The setups of 24 tasks used in our skill planning evaluation, where “Initial Items” refers\nto the tools provided in the agent’s inventory at the beginning of each episode, and “Max Steps”\nrepresents the maximum episode duration.

To some extent, this choice holds greater significance since our ultimate objective is\nto deploy the agent in the real world. To achieve this goal, we expand the Virtual Home benchmark\nby introducing a more extensive range of environments (50+ rooms), human-interaction tasks (200+\nfor each room), as well as diverse categories of actions (20+) and objects (100+), as illustrated in\nFigure 14.

(a) LLM-based agent’s feedback is un-\ncontrollable due to the uncertainty of input textual\nprompt, while visual cues can benefit the agent to\ngenerate feedbacks; (b) a text-only driven agent of-\nten finds it difficult to produce intuitive feedback\nthat humans can easily understand.\nDeveloping embodied agents that can adapt\nto the open world has long been a sub-\nstantial challenge (Kolve et al., 2017; Savva\net al., 2019).\nRecently, the rapid progress\nof large language models (LLMs) (OpenAI,\n2022; Touvron et al., 2023a) has shown their\npotential to serve as a general-purpose assis-\ntant. Driven by these pre-trained LLMs, re-\ncently proposed agents (Yuan et al., 2023;\nWang et al., 2023a;b; Zhu et al., 2023) have\nmanaged to extract world knowledge and rea-\nsoning capabilities from LLMs, allowing them\nto become self-driven. Thereby these agents\nare capable of generating executable policies\nor plans for a wide range of skills and tasks in\nan open-ended world.\nWhile current attempts to integrate LLMs\nshow promise in developing a generic embod-\nied agent, these efforts primarily translate the\nentire world into text, which overlooks the\n†Corresponding author\n1\narXiv:2310.13255v2  [cs.CV]  7 Dec 2023\nPreprint\nmultifaceted richness of diverse visual reality\nand turns interacting with the environment into something akin to “a blindfolded text-based game.”\nConsequently, such text-only agents often face difficulties when it comes to effectively and intu-\nitively representing the world. Imagine a situation where you request your agent to shop for a pair\nof shoes. Would you prefer to send the agent a picture of the shoes or provide a lengthy description\nof the shoes to convey their appearance? Undoubtedly, you would opt for the former choice.\nIn fact, the agent’s reliance on text input\/output (I\/O) imposes significant limitations on its ability to\ninteract with the world. To illustrate this point, we consider Minecraft (Guss et al., 2019; Fan et al.,\n2022) as an ideal example. Minecraft, being an expansive sandbox game, offers a vast realm for\nembodied agents to explore, which requires the acquisition of various basic skills (e.g., crafting logs)\nand the ability to plan and execute diverse tasks. First, as shown in Figure 1 (a), the LLM-based agent\nproduces uncontrollable outputs. The success of the agent’s responses hinges heavily on careful\nprompt engineering (Huang et al., 2022b), ensuring that the LLM comprehends the environment\nand task objectives. Moreover, a universally applicable prompt that suits every LLM and task is an\nunattainable goal. Therefore, this prompting process is labor-intensive and contradicts our aim of\nenabling agents to act in a self-driven manner. Second, when compared to visual feedback, language\noften encounters difficulties in intuitively conveying specific world concepts (e.g., recipes) to users,\nas illustrated in Figure 1 (b), thereby unavoidably creating obstacles for robust human-computer\/AI\ninteraction (Preece et al., 1994; Fallman, 2003).\nUnlike LLMs, humans possess an innate ability to process and generate information through both\nvisual and text channels. This inherent gift significantly enhances our capability to interact with\nthe world. However, the coupling of LLM-based agents with multimodal I\/O has been relatively\nunderexplored in an open-ended environment. To fill this gap, we introduce Steve-Eye\n, a large\nmultimodal model that enables LLM-based embodied agents to engage with the open world via\nvisual-text interfaces. Steve-Eye excels at producing responses that demonstrate a comprehensive\ngrasp of the environment, common-sense reasoning, and executable skill plans. To achieve this,\nSteve-Eye is equipped with three indispensable functions: (1) multimodal perception; (2) founda-\ntional knowledge base; and (3) skill prediction and planning. In this paper, we choose Minecraft as\nour validation platform considering its vast sandbox world and the high degree of freedom. More\nenvironments can also be considered, e.g., Virtual Home (Puig et al., 2018), AI2THOR (Kolve\net al., 2017). Due to the space limit, we discuss the exploration of more generic environments in\nAppendix A.4 and leave it as our future work. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\nOpen-World Instruction Dataset.\nWe construct an extensive instruction dataset to train Steve-\nEye for the acquisition of three mentioned functions. The instruction data contains not only the\nagent’s per-step status and environmental features but also the essential knowledge for agents to act\nand plan. However, collecting such a dataset in an open world can be a costly endeavor, especially\nwhen aiming to gather fine-grained and diverse labels. As a result, previous studies (Fan et al.,\n2022) have often relied on readily available unsupervised data (e.g., video-subtitle pairs) for pre-\ntraining. In these approaches, the agent’s comprehension of its status and environment is implicitly\nlearned through self-supervised techniques, while its foundational knowledge is directly derived\nfrom general-purpose LLMs. In contrast, our work involves curating multimodal instructional data\nspecifically designed for open-ended embodied agents, by utilizing ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022).\nLarge Multimodal Model and Training.\nSteve-Eye combines a visual encoder which converts\nvisual inputs into a sequence of embeddings, along with a pre-trained LLM which empowers em-\nbodied agents to engage in skill or task reasoning in an open world. During the training process, we\nemploy a two-stage strategy similar to Liu et al. (2023). This strategy commences with the align-\nment of multimodal elements between the visual encoder and the large language model, followed\nby the instruction tuning through our constructed dataset.\nOpen-World Benchmarks.\nWe carry out extensive experiments to demonstrate that our pro-\nposed Steve-Eye outperforms LLM-based agents in open-world setups. Specifically, we develop the\nfollowing benchmarks to evaluate agent performance from a broad range of perspectives: (1) envi-\nronmental visual captioning (ENV-VC), which assesses an agent’s capacity to perceive and describe\nits surroundings effectively; (2) foundational knowledge question answering (FK-QA), which eval-\nuates the proficiency in mastering basic knowledge crucial for an agent’s decision-making; (3) skill\nprediction and planning (SPP), which quantifies an agent’s capability to act and plan strategically.\n2\nPreprint\n2\nRELATED WORK\n2.1\nOPEN-WORLD EMBODIED AGENTS WITH LLMS\nThe rapid progress of large language models (Brown et al., 2020; Raffel et al., 2020; Zhang et al.,\n2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022) has significantly boosted their capacity to encode a wide range of\nhuman behaviors within training data (Bommasani et al., 2021). When equipped with narrowly de-\nsigned prompts, LLM-based agents exhibit the capability to generate executable plans for tasks such\nas indoor robot manipulation. For instance, SayCan (Ahn et al., 2022) integrates skill affordances\nwith LLMs to yield actionable plans, while Palm-E (Driess et al., 2023) takes a step further by\nconstructing hierarchical agents capable of handling multimodal prompts. This approach has also\nproven its efficacy in open-world environments (Huang et al., 2022a; Li et al., 2022). In contrast\nto robot manipulation, agents in the wild require a heightened level of real-time situational aware-\nness and foundational knowledge to execute intricate skill plans across a diverse array of tasks. To\nsimulate human behaviors in such open worlds, Generative Agents (Park et al., 2023) store agents’\nexperiences and retrieve these memories to generate plans in a text-based sandbox game.\nIn recent years, the 3D sandbox Minecraft has received considerable attention owing to its remark-\nably flexible game mechanics to serve as a prominent open-world benchmark (e.g., MineRL (Guss\net al., 2019) and Minedojo (Fan et al., 2022)). DEPS (Wang et al., 2023b) introduces the descrip-\ntor, explainer, and selector for plan generation with the help of LLM. Plan4MC (Yuan et al., 2023)\nconstructs a skill graph and proposes a skill search algorithm to minimize planning errors. Voy-\nager (Wang et al., 2023a) proposes an LLM-powered lifelong learning agent that continually ex-\nplores the Minecraft world. Similar to (Park et al., 2023), GITM (Zhu et al., 2023) integrates LLMs\nwith text-based memory and knowledge to create generic agents in Minecraft. Among these studies,\nVoyager (Wang et al., 2023a) and GITM (Zhu et al., 2023) lean entirely on text descriptions of the\nenvironment to act and plan, while Plan4MC (Yuan et al., 2023) and DEPS (Wang et al., 2023b)\nhave visual-input skills but still rely on merely text for planning. None of them try to understand the\nrich visual observation provided natively by Minecraft. In contrast to these works, our work trains a\nlarge multimodal model to fill this gap.\n2.2\nLARGE MULTIMODAL MODELS (LMMS)\nIn comparison to LLMs, large multimodal models (LMMs) (Awadalla et al., 2023) encompass\na broad range of information beyond text modality, which can be categorized into two primary\nstreams. The first category (Gupta & Kembhavi, 2023; Huang et al., 2023a; Patil et al., 2023; Sur´ıs\net al., 2023) involves hinging on ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) or GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) to generate\nin-context responses without parameter tuning. However, these approaches heavily rely on the avail-\nability of an LLM’s API and the quality of the designed prompts. The second category comprises\nend-to-end pre-trained models. Within this category, models such as Huang et al. (2023b); Peng et al.\n(2023) are trained entirely from scratch. Conversely, some research explores efficient fine-tuning us-\ning pre-trained LLMs by incorporating lightweight modality encoders, such as Qformer (Li et al.,\n2023) or Perceiver (Alayrac et al., 2022). Recently, Liu et al. (2023) propose to explicitly instruction-\ntune a LLM using vision-language instruction data.\nIn this work, we propose Steve-Eye by building upon pre-trained LLMs, aiming to develop an open-\nworld agent powered by a large-scale model with versatile multimodal I\/O capabilities.\n3\nMETHODOLOGY\nIn this section, we first provide our instruction-following dataset to develop three key functions for\nthe agent’s open-world interaction in Section 3.1. We then propose our large multimodal agent\nSteve-Eye in Section 3.2, and clarify details of the training procedure in Section 3.3. We adopt\nMinecraft as our open-ended platform in this paper to collect data and validate the model, anticipat-\ning to explore a broader range of environments for Steve-Eye in future studies.\nTo empower an agent with the self-driven capacity to act and plan in an open world, we posit that the\nfollowing embodied functions are indispensable: (1) multimodal perception function which offers\na detailed description of the agent status and environmental features; (2) foundational knowledge\n3\nPreprint\nbase which imparts an understanding of how the world works and conveys crucial basic knowledge\nrelated to skills and tasks; (3) skill prediction and planning which is responsible for generating\nskill execution feedback (e.g., success or failure) and crafting high-level skill plans for handling\nmore complex and long-horizon tasks. We develop these functions by building the corresponding\ninstruction dataset to pre-train Steve-Eye as follows.\n3.1\nOPEN-WORLD INSTRUCTION-FOLLOWING DATASET\nMultimodal Perception Instructions.\nHuman players can perform actions in Minecraft mainly\nrelying on their visual perception, without any prior hints or imposed game judgments. In order to\nendow Steve-Eye with the same ability, it is required to provide it with comprehensive visual descrip-\ntions of the environment. To achieve this, we use Minedojo (Fan et al., 2022) to obtain Minecraft\nsnapshots which contain a wide array of details within the agent’s surroundings, including environ-\nmental features, the agent’s life and food status, inventory items, and equipment, as illustrated in\nFigure 2. In addition, we leverage MaskCLIP (Zhou et al., 2022) to identify the in-sight objects of\nthese snapshots without supervised annotations. During our data collection process, for each snap-\nshot I and its corresponding description XC, we initiate a three-step approach. Firstly, we prompt\nChatGPT to curate a list of 40 instructions as shown in Figure 6 in Appendix A.1.1. Then we enrich\nsnapshot details as dense caption to describe its content, with the assistance of ChatGPT. Finally,\nwe select an instruction XQ randomly from the list and combine it with the snapshot’s caption to\ncreate a single-round multimodal description pair (e.g., ### Human: XQ I\\n ### Embodied Agent:\nXC\\n.). By doing so, we collect 200K instructional pairs for multimodal perception learning.\n[Description] Steve is walking in the forest and\nhe can’t see the sky. There are trees in front of\nhim. He still has 20.0 life and 20.0 food. He is\nnow equipped with the iron pickaxe and the\ninventory contains 5 pickaxes, 6 ……\n•\nenvironment\n•\nlife and food\n•\nobject in sight\n•\ninventory and \nequipment\nFigure 2. Multimodal perception\nFoundational Knowledge Instructions.\nEmbodied agents\nrequire a foundation of essential knowledge to facilitate action-\ntaking and skill planning.\nIn Minecraft, such knowledge\nshould contain item recipes, details of item attributes, their as-\nsociated numerical value, etc. We access this vital information\nfrom Minecraft-Wiki (Fandom, 2023), which comprises an ex-\ntensive collection of over 9,000 HTML pages. To be specific,\nwe first obtain all item icons from Minecraft-Wiki and gener-\nate 200K icon inventory images, as illustrated in Figure 3 (a).\nEach icon image corresponds to a 4-row table with an associ-\nated caption adhering to a standardized template: “There is a\nMinecraft inventory with 4 rows. From left to right, they are\n...”. As shown in Figuire 7 in Appendix A.1.2, we curate a set of 20 distinct prompts designed to\nchallenge the model’s ability to recognize items. Subsequently, we further collect all recipe-related\ninformation from the Wiki as illustrated in Figure 3 (b), and design similar prompt templates to for-\nmulate 10,000 recipe-image instructional pairs. Lastly, we process the Wiki and utilize this corpus\nto produce 40,000 single-round question-answer pairs. In total, we collect a high-quality dataset\nwith 250K foundational knowledge instructions.\n(a) Item icons\n(b) recipes\nFigure 3. Icons and recipes\nSkill-related Interaction Instructions.\nThe environmen-\ntal description and foundational knowledge serve as prerequi-\nsites for an agent’s interaction within the open world. How-\never, a successful interaction requires more than these ele-\nments alone. It relies upon the mastery of basic skills, such\nas log, harvesting, and food preparation, as well as high-level\nskill planning abilities to tackle complex, long-horizon tasks,\nsuch as crafting an iron pickaxe. To facilitate this, we gather\ncorresponding training data for skill prediction and planning,\nwhich enables our model to provide correct feedback on both\nbasic skills and long-horizon tasks across a spectrum of agent\nor environmental conditions. Specifically, the data collection\nprocess involves two steps. First, we sample skill trajecto-\nries based on the pre-trained basic skill policies and collect\n200K snapshot pairs with corresponding statuses from these\ntrajectories. Each snapshot pair {I0, It} denotes the 0-th and\nt-th timestamp of the skill trajectory. Next, we employ Chat-\nGPT to generate question-answer pairs about diverse aspects of skill execution status. These ques-\n4\nPreprint\nHow to craft a wooden axe? \nAnswer me via a recipe image.\nWhat are the ingredients required \nto craft a detector rail?\nProvide a detailed description of \nthe given Minecraft image <image>. \n…\n…\n<image> \nMake a plan list to finish the task \nof <image> in Minecraft. \n<image> \nIron Ingot, Stone Pressure \nPlate, and Redstone Dust.\nFrom left to right, there are 1 \nshears in the inventory, which \nmeans he is equipped with 1 \nshears.

Steve-Eye excels in acquiring fundamental knowledge of the world it\nlives in, understanding the nuances of its surroundings, and generating executable plans to complete\na wide array of open-ended tasks. Furthermore, Steve-Eye responds to user instructions through\neither visual or text-based cues, enhancing the convenience and flexibility of human-AI interaction.\ntions delve into whether the agent completes the skill, encounters unexpected failures, or seeks\nexplanations for such failures. More details can be found in Appendix A.1.3. Second, we sam-\nple 40K task trajectories using the planner in Yuan et al. (2023), each of which can be denoted as\nT = {s1, s2, ...sT} representing the task is finished via a T-round planning procedure, where si is\nthe skill plan for i-th round. At each round i, we feed our model with its start snapshot and task\ninitialization, and curate instructional questions to inquire about si with reasonable explanation. In\nthis manner, we obtain 200K instructional pairs from task trajectories.\n3.2\nMODEL ARCHITECTURE\nFigure 4 illustrates the overall architecture of our proposed model. Steve-Eye, functioning as a\ngenerative model, connects an image-oriented tokenizer fv with the pre-trained LLM backbone Θ.\nWe adopt the image tokenizer, e.g., VQ-GAN (Esser et al., 2021), to encode the raw images I into\ntoken embeddings V = {v1, v2, ..., vn} ∈Rn×d, where n denotes the number of visual tokens and\nd is the dimensionality of each token. We further utilize a lightweight projection module fl with\na trainable projection matrix W. This module maps the visual tokens to the same space with text\nembeddings, yielding ˆV = {ˆv1, ˆv2, ..., ˆvn} ∈Rn× ˆd:\n  \\ hat  {\\ma t h cal {V}} = W \\mathcal {V}; \\hspace {0.3em} \\text {where} \\hspace {0.3em} \\mathcal {V} = f_v(I). \n(1)\nTo effectively process visual-language inputs and generate corresponding outputs, our model inte-\ngrates the visual codebook Cv into the pre-existing language vocabulary Cl. This integration leads\nto the formation of a unified multimodal codebook, denoted as Cm = Cv ∪Cl. Additionally, in\norder to mark the starting and ending points of visual elements in I\/O sequences, we introduce two\nspecial tokens, namely <vis> and <\/vis>. The LLM backbone Θ of our Steve-Eye is built upon a\ndecoder-only architecture with casual transformers. Our model employs an auto-regressive predic-\ntion mechanism, generating responses based on the provided multimodal input tokens. The resulting\nresponse is a mixed sequence of visual and textual tokens, represented as Y = {y1, y2, ..., ym}. For\neach embedding yi, we pass it through a linear layer fp followed by a softmax operation, mapping\nit into a probability distribution of the multimodal vocabulary. The final prediction for the i-th token\nzi is determined by selecting the token from the multimodal codebook with the highest score:\n  z _i = \\argmax ( \\text {softmax}(f_p(y_i))). \n(2)\n3.3\nTRAINING\nEach instruction-following instance can be formulated as a multi-round conversation {X 1\nQ, X 1\nC, ...,\nX N\nQ , X N\nC }, where each {X i\nQ, X i\nC} represents a question-answer interaction between a human and\n5\nPreprint\nthe embodied agent and N indicates the total number of rounds in the conversation. The entire\ninstructional dataset follows this unified template, as demonstrated in Figure 11 in Appendix A.1.3.\nTo efficiently train our model, we employ the negative log-likelihood objective over the prediction\ntokens with instruction tuning:\n  \\m a t\nh\nc\nal \n{L} (\\Theta )=-\\sum _{j=1}^{L} \\log P_{\\Theta }(y_j|\\mathcal {I}, \\hat {y}_{1:j-1}), \n(3)\nwhere y and ˆy respectively denote the input and target token sequences, with Θ representing the\nmodel parameters, and L representing the length of the target sequence. The input visual content\nI may represent an empty image depending on the input instruction. It is worth noting that we\nconstrain the loss computation to only consider the answer tokens XC. This constraint prevents\ntraining from becoming excessively straightforward and ensures that the model’s primary focus is\non learning to precisely generate coherent responses. Similar to Liu et al. (2023), we adopt a two-\nstage instruction-tuning strategy to train our model:\nTwo-Stage Instruction-Tuning. (1) Multimodal feature alignment: In the first stage, our pri-\nmary objective is to align visual features with the language token space. In order to strike a bal-\nance between efficient tuning and a comprehensive coverage of the world’s concepts, we curate our\nopen-ended instruction dataset to 600K snapshot-text pairs. These pairs are then transformed into\ninstruction-following data as described in Section 3.1. During the feature alignment stage, we main-\ntain the visual encoder and the LLM parameters in a frozen state, exclusively training the projection\nmodule. Additionally, this training phase involves fine-tuning token embeddings to accommodate\nthe newly introduced visual codebook and two special tokens <vis> and <\/vis>. (2) End-to-end\ninstruction tuning: In the second stage, we continue to keep the visual encoder frozen while concur-\nrently training the projection module and LLM. This second stage leverages the entire open-ended\ninstructions and contributes significantly to enhancing the model’s capability of comprehending and\neffectively responding to complex multimodal instructions.\n4\nEXPERIMENTS\n4.1\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nImplementation Details.\nIn this paper, we use the LLaMA-2 model (Touvron et al., 2023b)\nas the LLM backbone. Additionally, we use CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) as our visual encoder\nto achieve the best performance for non-visual generative tasks, and use VQ-GAN (Esser et al.,\n2021) as the default visual tokenizer for visual generation. The size of visual codebook Cv and\nlanguage vocabulary is 8192 and 32000, respectively. In addition, we add <vis> and <\/vis> to the\nfinal unified codebook, indicating the starting and ending points of visual content. Similar to Liu\net al. (2023), we construct 850K instruction-answer pairs for model training. Note that the model\nis trained to predict the agent’s answer, and thus only sequence\/tokens of answer will be used to\ncompute the loss in the auto-regressive model. We also adopt LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) to reduce the\ncomputational cost for efficient tuning. We choose MineDojo (Fan et al., 2022) as the Minecraft\nplatform to collect our instruction data and conduct experiments. Following Yuan et al. (2023),\nwe use the environments of programmatic tasks to train basic policies with RL. These policies are\ntrained to execute corresponding skills and keep fixed in all testing tasks.\nEvaluation Benchmarks.\nWe conduct experiments on three benchmarks to evaluate an agent’s\ninteraction ability in an open world. (1) Environmental visual captioning (ENV-VC): given a\nsnapshot, the model is asked to describe the agent’s current status and environmental features from\ndiverse aspects (e.g., life, food...). We evaluate the prediction’s accuracy of each aspect by ex-\ntracting corresponding answers from the output description to compare with the groundtruth. (2)\nFoundational knowledge question answering (FK-QA): to assess the model’s grasp of essential\nknowledge, we collect a set of 10,000 Minecraft-related questions from different sources, including\nthe Wiki pages, Wiki tables, and Minecraft recipes. The performance is measured by the model’s\nability to provide correct answers to these questions. (3) Skill prediction and planning (SPP): we\nutilize our proposed Steve-Eye to predict whether a skill has been successfully completed and assert\nits capability to generate executable high-level skill plans for long-horizon tasks.\n6\nPreprint\nTable 1.

These six questions pertain to the prediction of various aspects, including\ninventory items\n, equipment\n, objects in sight\n, life\n, food\n, and the visibility of sky\n.\nDuring the inference phase, Steve-Eye predicts answers based on these questions and the input\nsnapshot. Experimental results are presented in Table 1 and Table 2. As shown in Table 1, our\nvisual encoder, when combined with multimodal instruction tuning, significantly enables the ability\nof the text-only language model LLM (Llama-2-7b) to comprehend the contents of the snapshots\n(Steve-Eye-7b). Notably, Steve-Eye outperforms BLIP-2 by a substantial margin due to the im-\nproved reasoning ability enabled by the larger LLM. Furthermore, the visual encoder plays a crucial\nrole in facilitating multimodal understanding. Surprisingly, the model equipped with CLIP (Radford\net al., 2021) surpasses the performance of the model using MineCLIP (Fan et al., 2022), achieving\nover +48.9%, +21.0% and +19.9% improvements in inventory, equipment, and object-in-sight pre-\ndictions, respectively. We attribute this performance difference to the fact that MineCLIP does not\nprioritize fine-grained alignment during pre-training, despite being exposed to a diverse range of\nMinecraft videos. In summary, Steve-Eye’s ability to comprehend visual cues from its surroundings\nlays the foundation for subsequent interactions with the world.\nTo investigate the effictiveness of various types of instructional data for multimodal perception, we\ncarry out experimental comparisons with diverse data configurations in Table 2. First, our results\nshowcase a significant improvement in the model’s capacity to respond to instructional questions\nthrough instruction tuning, which leads to impressive gains of over +50% for inventory, equipment,\nand object-in-sight prediction. Furthermore, the inclusion of the multimodal perception dataset and\nicon images in the training data both contribute to a substantial improvement in the model’s overall\nperformance. Ultimately, the best results are achieved when combining all available data sources.\n4.3\nFOUDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE QUESTION ANSWERING (FK-QA)\nFollowing Team (2022), we establish a question database specialized to assess our model’s pro-\nficiency in generating responses pertaining to fundamental Minecraft knowledge. This evaluation\nis carried out through a validation dataset known as the FK-QA test set, which is further divided\ninto two distinct subsets: TEXT and IMG. In the FK-QA TEXT subset, we generate a collection\nof 10,000 question-answer pairs curated from various sources, including the Minecraft-Wiki pages,\nMinecraft-Wiki tables, and Minecraft recipes. Each category comprises 2,000, 5,000, and 3,000\npairs, respectively. Upon receiving a response from Steve-Eye, we feed both the generated response\n7\nPreprint\nTable 3. Comparisons on FK-QA test set of the foundational knowledge question answering bench-\nmark. The evaluation metrics consider both the scoring and accuracy dimensions simultaneously.\nScoring\nAccuracy\nWiki Page\nWiki Table\nRecipe\nTEXT All\nTEXT\nIMG\nLlama-2-7b\n6.90\n6.21\n7.10\n6.62\n37.01%\n-\nLlama-2-13b\n6.31 (-0.59)\n6.16 (-0.05)\n6.31 (-0.79)\n6.24 (-0.38)\n37.96%\n-\nLlama-2-70b\n6.91 (+0.01)\n6.97 (+0.76)\n7.23 (+0.13)\n7.04 (+0.42)\n38.27%\n-\ngpt-turbo-3.5\n7.26 (+0.36)\n7.15 (+0.94)\n7.97 (+0.87)\n7.42 (+0.80)\n41.78%\n-\nSteve-Eye-7b\n7.21 (+0.31)\n7.28 (+1.07)\n7.82 (+0.72)\n7.54 (+0.92)\n43.25%\n62.83%\nSteve-Eye-13b\n7.38 (+0.48)\n7.44 (+1.23)\n7.93 (+0.83)\n7.68 (+1.06)\n44.36%\n65.13%\nand the corresponding groundtruth answer to ChatGPT. ChatGPT will first examine the accuracy of\nthe response as a measure of answer correctness. To minimize variability in error, ChatGPT con-\nducts a further evaluation, considering the response’s accuracy, relevance, and level of detail. This\ncomprehensive evaluation yields an overall score on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, where a higher\nscore signifies superior overall performance. In the FK-QA IMG subset, we shift our focus to visual\ngeneration by employing 3,000 recipe images as groundtruth data. Here, our model is tasked with\ngenerating visual outputs for each item within the recipe inventory, following a specific order. The\nvisual output is considered correct only if every element of the recipe is accurately generated. We\nadopt this metric to assert our model’s ability to produce multimodal feedback.\nTable 3 presents both scoring and accuracy results. It’s worthy to note that Llama-2 exhibits consis-\ntent performance regardless of the model’s scale, with Llama-2-70b only marginally outperforming\nthe 7b-version by +1.26% in accuracy, meanwhile 13b-version performs even worse than 7b-version\non the scoring results. We hypothesize that this phenomenon can be attributed to distinct variations\nin difficulty levels encountered within our FK-QA test set. Llama-2 fails to answer correctly for the\nchallenging part regardless of its size due to essential knowledge missing. In contrast, Steve-Eye\noutperforms both Llama-2 and gpt-turbo-3.5, despite its considerably smaller scale. Furthermore,\nour model exhibits a more substantial improvement in responding to Recipe and Wiki Table ques-\ntions as compared to Wiki Page questions. This disparity can likely be attributed to the fact that\nWiki Page contains a large proportion of invalid questions (e.g., version, history), whereas Recipe\nand Wiki Table predominantly feature knowledge-related inquiries. Such result further validates the\neffectiveness of our approach in acquiring foundational knowledge. Unlike text-only LLMs, our\nmodel exhibits considerable ability to output visual contents, which achieves 65.13% accuracy on\nFK-QA IMG using the 13b-version. The multimodal generation ability enables Steve-Eye to better\nserve as an assistant for potential needed people such as beginners of this game. We show more\ndetails and cases in Appendix A.3.\n4.4\nSKILL PREDICTION AND PLANNING (SPP)\nSkill Prediction.\nSimilar to Section 3.1, we collect another 20K snapshot pairs in the form of\n{I0, It} from skill trajectories (referred to as Skill-Pred test). These pairs are input into our model\nto query the current execution status of the skill. The execution status can fall into one of three cate-\ngories: success, failure, and running, with “running” signifying that the skill is currently in progress.\nTable 4.\nRecall\/Accuracy results on Skill-Pred\ntest set for the skill prediction benchmark.\nrunning (%) success (%)\nfail (%)\nBLIP-2\n65.2\/58.8\n49.8\/54.3\n42.1\/51.8\nSteve-Eye-7b\n89.8\/82.5\n77.6\/81.4\n74.2\/79.9\nSteve-Eye-13b\n92.1\/84.2\n80.5\/83.1\n76.8\/81.5\nAs shown in Table 4, our model exhibits com-\nmendable performance in skill status predic-\ntion.\nHowever, the performance is still far\nfrom enough to completely replace the rule-\nbased game judgment adopted by the existing\nRL-based skill agents. These experiments indi-\ncate that, despite the excellent multimodal un-\nderstanding capabilities of our model in open-\nworld environments in previous experiments, it\nstill falls short in fine-grained reasoning tasks that involve consecutive frames to some extent.\nSkill Planning.\nFollowing Yuan et al. (2023), we carry out evaluation on 24 difficult tasks in\nMinecraft. These tasks can be categorized into three types: cutting trees to craft primary items (7),\nmining cobblestones to craft advanced items (7), and interacting with mobs to harvest food and ma-\nterials (10). Each task is tested for 30 episodes, where an episode refers to a multi-round interaction\n8\nPreprint\nTable 5. Comparisons on the skill planning benchmark. We test the mean success rates of all tasks,\nwhere each task is executed for 30 episodes using the same seeds for initialization.\nModel\nMineAgent\n0.00\n0.03\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.21\n0.0\n0.05\n0.0\ngpt assistant\n0.30\n0.17\n0.07\n0.00\n0.03\n0.00\n0.20\n0.00\n0.20\n0.03\n0.13\n0.00\n0.10\n0.00\nSteve-Eye-auto\n0.30\n0.27\n0.37\n0.23\n0.20\n0.17\n0.26\n0.07\n0.13\n0.17\n0.20\n0.33\n0.00\n0.13\nSteve-Eye\n0.40\n0.30\n0.43\n0.53\n0.33\n0.37\n0.43\n0.30\n0.43\n0.47\n0.47\n0.40\n0.13\n0.23\nModel\nMineAgent\n0.46\n0.50\n0.33\n0.35\n0.0\n0.0\n0.06\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\ngpt assistant\n0.57\n0.76\n0.43\n0.30\n0.00\n0.00\n0.37\n0.00\n0.03\n0.00\nSteve-Eye-auto\n0.70\n0.63\n0.40\n0.30\n0.17\n0\n0.37\n0.03\n0.07\n0.00\nSteve-Eye\n0.73\n0.67\n0.47\n0.33\n0.23\n0.07\n0.43\n0.10\n0.17\n0.07\nprocess. At each round, the model receives the environmental feedback from the last round, plans\na skill list based on the current status, and then picks up the top skill to execute. For each task\nepisode, we set a maximum step between [3000, 10000]. In our evaluation, we compare Steve-Eye\nagainst two baseline approaches: (1) MineAgent (Fan et al., 2022), which completes tasks without\ndecomposing them into basic skills, and uses PPO and self-imitation learning with CLIP reward,\nand (2) GPT Assistant, which employs ChatGPT as a high-level planner to generate skill plans by\nprompting itself with information from the environment and the agent’s status. The results in Ta-\nble 5 demonstrate that Steve-Eye significantly outperforms both baseline methods. Additionally, we\nconduct experiments in which Steve-Eye takes over the skill prediction function from the rule-based\ngame judgment in Minecraft. This self-driven variant is referred to as ‘Steve-Eye-auto.’ Since the\nmodel’s skill prediction is not always 100% accurate, Steve-Eye-auto does experience some perfor-\nmance degradation when compared to Steve-Eye. This degradation is more pronounced in longer,\ncomplex tasks (e.g.,\n,\n,\n) as opposed to short-term tasks (e.g.,\n,\n,\n). Nevertheless,\nSteve-Eye-auto still demonstrates significant performance improvements in most tasks, compared to\nthe baselines. For additional details about this benchmark, please refer to Appendix A.2.\nFor better visualization, we provide a qualitative example of Steve-Eye completing the task “crafting\nstone axe with wooden pickaxe” as shown in Figure 5.\nfind cobblestone\nharvest cobblestone\nfind trees\nharvest log\ncraft planks\ncraft and place table\ncraft stone axe\nbirthplace\nFigure 5. Snapshots of a qualitative example, illustrating how Steve-Eye completes the task of\n“crafting a stone axe with a wooden pickaxe.” Our model generates a skill plan at each interaction\nround and selects the top skill from the plan list for execution.\n5\nCONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we explore enabling a large multimodal model to serve as a generative embodied\nagent in open worlds. We achieve this goal by proposing Steve-Eye, which combines the text-only\nlanguage model with a visual encoder, allowing for a multimodal I\/O interface to interact with the\nenvironment. With the help of ChatGPT, we curate questions to generate 850K instruction-following\ndata to facilitate the agent’s multimodal perception fuction, foundational knowledge mastery, as well\nas the capability of skill prediction and planning. Experiments on three open-world benchmarks\nverify the advantages of our Steve-Eye over a wide range of perspectives.\n9\nPreprint\nREFERENCES\nMichael Ahn, Anthony Brohan, Noah Brown, Yevgen Chebotar, Omar Cortes, Byron David, Chelsea\nFinn, Chuyuan Fu, Keerthana Gopalakrishnan, Karol Hausman, et al.

Furthermore, we delve into the skill planning benchmark and its associ-\nated task setups in Appendix A.2. In Appendix A.3 we present qualitative cases that illustrate our\nmodel’s ability to provide intuitive visual feedback and serve as an intelligent chatbot with a multi-\nmodal input-output interface. Finally, we explore the potential applications of our model in diverse\nenvironments, such as Virtual Home (Puig et al., 2018).\nA.1\nDATASET\nA.1.1\nMULTIMODAL PERCEPTION INSTRUCTIONS\nThis dataset contains 200K instructional pairs. Figure 6 illustrates a partial listing of instructional\nquestions employed for describing the content of the Minecraft snapshots. These instructions convey\nsimilar meanings, albeit with slight variations in natural language.\n•\n\"Describe the following Minecraft image in detail\",\n•\n\"Provide a detailed description of the given Minecraft image\",\n•\n\"Give an elaborate explanation of the Minecraft game image you see\",\n•\n\"Share a comprehensive rundown of the presented Minecraft image\",\n•\n\"Offer a thorough analysis of the Minecraft frame\",\n•\n\"Explain the various aspects of the Minecraft image before you\",\n•\n\"Examine the Minecraft image closely and share its details\",\n•\n\"Write an exhaustive depiction of the given Minecraft image“\n•\n\"Clarify the contents of the displayed Minecraft image with great detail\",\n•\n\"Narrate the contents of the Minecraft image with precision\"\nFigure 6. 10 instruction examples for multimodal perception instructions.\nA.1.2\nFOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE INSTRUCTIONS\nThe dataset comprises 250K training instances, which is organized into three distinct subsets: 200K\nicon image instructions, 10K recipe image instructions, and 40K Minecraft-Wiki corpus instructions.\nFor the icon images, we generate questions aimed at prompting the model to recognize and describe\nitem icons within the inventory, as depicted in Figure 7. Similarly, we curate instructional questions\nfor recipe images as shown in Figure 8, with the objective of extracting information on completing\nspecific recipes. In addition, we preprocess the raw Minecraft-Wiki HTML pages by removing\nirrelevant information (e.g., reference links) and unresolved data, transforming the raw corpus into\na formatted, clean Markdown version. Leveraging the capabilities of ChatGPT, we employ this\npowerful language model to generate 10 questions, each with its corresponding answer, for every\npage of the cleaned Wiki corpus. This process yields a collection of 40K single-round question-\nanswer pairs, which can be utilized for instruction tuning.\n13\nPreprint\n•\n\"Provide a brief description of the given recipe image.\"\n•\n\"Offer a succinct explanation of the recipe picture presented.\"\n•\n\"Summarize the recipe content about icons of the image.\"\n•\n\"Give a short and clear explanation of the subsequent recipe image.\"\n•\n\"Share a concise interpretation of the recipe image provided.\"\n•\n\"Present a compact recipe description of the photo's key features.\"\n•\n\"Relay a brief, clear account of the recipe picture shown.\"\n•\n\"Render a clear and concise recipe summary of the photo.\"\n•\n\"Write a terse but informative recipe summary of the picture.\"\n•\n\"Create an icon narrative representing the recipe image presented.\"\nFigure 8. 10 instruction examples of recipe image for foundational knowledge instructions.\n•\n\"Clarify the contents of the displayed inventory image with great attention to detail.“\n•\n\"Characterize the inventory image with a meticulously detailed description.“\n•\n\"Break down the individual slot elements within the inventory image with precision.“\n•\n\"Take a step-by-step journey through the important details of the Minecraft inventory image.“\n•\n\"Paint a vivid and descriptive narrative of the Minecraft inventory image.“\n•\n\"Provide a precise narration of the contents within the Minecraft inventory image.“\n•\n\"Thoroughly analyze the Minecraft inventory image in a comprehensive and detailed manner.“\n•\n\"Illustrate the Minecraft inventory image through a descriptive and informative explanation.“\n•\n\"Examine the Minecraft inventory image closely and share its intricate details.“\n•\n\"Compose an exhaustive depiction of the given Minecraft inventory image.\"\nFigure 7. 10 instruction examples of icon images for foundational knowledge instructions.\nA.1.3\nSKILL-RELATED INTERACTION INSTRUCTIONS\nFor skill prediction, we utilize the skill policies trained by Yuan et al. (2023) to create a dataset\ncomprising 200K skill trajectories. In each trajectory, we extract timestamps from the initial and\nt-th points to generate a snapshot pair, denoted as {I0, It}. We then construct questions aimed at\ndetermining whether the agent successfully executed the skill or, in the case of failure, identifying\nthe underlying reasons for the unsuccessful attempt. Illustrative examples of these skill prediction\nquestions are provided in Figure 9. We also provide examples with snapshot pairs in Figure 10.\n14\nPreprint\n•\n\"\"Steve is demonstrating his proficiency in {SKILL_NAME}, with the objective of achieving {SKILL_DEFINITION}. We'll now assess \nboth the initial and current frames to determine if he has successfully executed the skill and the reasons behind it:\"\n•\n\"\"The skill Steve is performing is {SKILL_NAME}, and its intended outcome is to {SKILL_DEFINITION}. To determine whether Steve \nhas accomplished this skill, we need to analyze both the starting and current frames:“\n•\n\"\"Steve is currently engaged in executing {SKILL_NAME}, aiming to achieve {SKILL_DEFINITION}. In order to evaluate his success in \nperforming this skill, we'll examine both the initial frame and the current frame:“\n•\n\"\"The task at hand for Steve involves mastering {SKILL_NAME}, with the ultimate goal of accomplishing {SKILL_DEFINITION}. To \nascertain whether he has successfully completed this skill, we'll analyze both the starting and current frames:“\n•\n\"\"Steve is in the process of mastering the art of {SKILL_NAME}, with the specific objective of accomplishing {SKILL_DEFINITION}.\nWe will now evaluate whether Steve has successfully executed this skill by comparing the initial and current frames:“\n•\n\"\"The skill that Steve is currently executing is {SKILL_NAME}, and the intended outcome is {SKILL_DEFINITION}. To determine if \nSteve has effectively executed this skill, we'll assess both the initial frame and the current frame:“\n•\n\"\"Steve is currently performing the {SKILL_NAME} skill, with the aim of achieving {SKILL_DEFINITION}.

To determine \nwhether Steve has successfully executed this skill, we will analyze both the initial frame and the current frame:“\n•\n\"\"Steve is in the process of executing the {SKILL_NAME} skill, with the ultimate aim of accomplishing {SKILL_DEFINITION}. Our\nassessment will involve a comparison between the starting frame and the current frame to determine if he has succeeded and why:“\nFigure 9. 10 instruction examples for skill prediction instructions.\nQ: Steve is finding logs nearby, did he \ncomplete this skill?\nA: No.\nQ: Why does he fail?\nA: Because Steve has died.\nQ: Steve is finding sheep nearby, does \nhe fail?\nA: No. Steve found a sheep in sight.\nQ: Steve plans to craft a table, does he \nfinish this skill successfully?\nA: Yes he does.\nQ: Steve is asked to collect planks, what \nis the results?\nA: Steve collect planks successfully.\nQ: Steve collects wool in Minecraft, \nwhat is the consequence?\nA: Steve fails to finish the sill.\nQ: Please help me analyze the reasons \nfor the failure.\nA: Sure, there is no sheep in sight\nQ: Steve is mining cobblestone, does he \nfinish this skill?\nA: No.\nQ: How do you know that?\nA: No additional cobblestone shown in \nthe inventory\nFigure 10. Illustrative examples of skill prediction instruction data with snapshot pairs.\nTemplate of Instructional Training Data. Similar to Liu et al. (2023), we formulate each instruc-\ntional instance as a multi-round conversation as shown in Figure 11, where Xhead message is a sentence\nto describe this assistant (e.g., “ You are in a chat between a curious human and an artificial intelli-\ngence assistant. You should serve as an assistant to give helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the\nhuman’s questions.”). The number of rounds relies on the input instruction content. And the input\nimages (denoted as < image >) will only be fed in the first round, while XC may contain visual\noutputs with two additional tokens < vis > and < \/vis >.\n15\nPreprint\nFigure 11. The unified template to generate input sequence for instructional tuning.\nA.2\nSKILL PLANNING BENCHMARK\nTo clarify this benchmark, we begin by offering comprehensive task setup details in Table 6. During\nthe evaluation phase, we relocate the agent to a random location at the initiation of every episode,\nwith distances of up to 500 units, ensuring that the agent spawns in an unfamiliar environment. Fur-\nthermore, for tasks that involve interacting with mobs, we enforce a maximum spawning distance of\n30 units for cows and sheep. Our approach to complete tasks is rooted in a hierarchical framework.\nSpecifically, our model exclusively generates high-level skill plans, delegating the actual skill exe-\ncution to pre-trained basic skill policies as introduced by Yuan et al. (2023). Notably, we introduce\na self-driven variant named ’Steve-Eye-auto,’ which serves not only as a planner but also replaces\nthe Minecraft rules to verify the successful execution of skills.\nTable 6. The setups of 24 tasks used in our skill planning evaluation, where “Initial Items” refers\nto the tools provided in the agent’s inventory at the beginning of each episode, and “Max Steps”\nrepresents the maximum episode duration. Any episode exceeding this limit is classified as a task\nfailure. The tasks are originally developed by Yuan et al. (2023).\n(a) 7 tasks involving the process of “cutting trees to craft primary items”.\nTask Icon\nTask Name\nstick\ncrafting table nearby\nbowl\nchest\ntrap door\nsign\nwooden pickaxe\nInitial Items\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nMax Steps\n3000\n3000\n3000\n3000\n3000\n3000\n3000\n(b) 7 tasks involving the process of “mining cobblestones to craft advanced items”.\nTask Icon\nTask Name\nfurname nearby\nstone stairs\nstone slab\ncobblestone wall\nlever\ntorch\nstone pickaxe\nInitial Items\n*10\n*10\n*10\n*10\n*10\nMax Steps\n5000\n5000\n3000\n5000\n5000\n5000\n10000\n(c) 10 tasks involving the process of “interacting with mobs to harvest food and materials”.\nTask Icon\nTask Name\nmilk\nbucket\nwool\nbeef\nmutton\nbed\npainting\ncarpet\nitem\nframe\ncooked\nbeef\ncooked\nbutton\nInitial Items\n,\n*3\n,\n*2\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\nMax Steps\n3000\n3000\n3000\n3000\n10000\n10000\n3000\n10000\n10000\n10000\n16\nPreprint\nTable 7.

Nevertheless, it is evident that\nSteve-Eye can be applied to other open-world environments, such as Virtual Home (Puig et al., 2018)\nand AI2THOR (Kolve et al., 2017), with minimal manual effort using the same methodology in this\npaper. These alternative benchmarks, when compared to Minecraft, exhibit a closer alignment with\nthe real world. To some extent, this choice holds greater significance since our ultimate objective is\nto deploy the agent in the real world. To achieve this goal, we expand the Virtual Home benchmark\nby introducing a more extensive range of environments (50+ rooms), human-interaction tasks (200+\nfor each room), as well as diverse categories of actions (20+) and objects (100+), as illustrated in\nFigure 14. The corresponding validation and further exploration of open-ended embodied agents in\na real-world context will be the focus of our future work.\n19\n\n```\n\n#### 5. 学生问题\n问题1：介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」\n问题2：这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？\n问题3：这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？\n\n\n请输出论文总结\n### 输出格式（输出语言用中文）\n```\n## 💡 解答问题1 (...复述学生问题1...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (...复述学生问题2...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (...复述学生问题3...)\n...\n```\n","llm_summary_res":"## 🌟 论文解读 | Steve-Eye：为基于LLM的具身智能体赋予开放世界的视觉感知能力\n\n## 📌 背景痛点\/本文动机\n近年来，大型语言模型（LLMs）在赋予具身智能体与世界互动的能力方面取得了显著进展，这标志着通用机器人技术迈出了第一步。然而，这些研究往往忽略了开放世界的视觉丰富性，导致整个交互过程类似于“一个蒙着眼睛的基于文本的游戏”。因此，基于LLM的智能体在直观地理解周围环境和生成易于理解的响应方面经常遇到挑战。\n\n## 🚀 核心方法\n为了解决这一局限性，本文提出了Steve-Eye，这是一个端到端训练的大型多模态模型，旨在赋予基于LLM的具身智能体在开放世界中进行视觉感知的能力。Steve-Eye将LLM与视觉编码器相结合，使其能够处理视觉-文本输入并生成多模态反馈。此外，我们使用半自动策略收集了一个包含850K开放世界指令对的广泛数据集，使我们的模型能够涵盖智能体的三个基本功能：多模态感知、基础知识库和技能预测与规划。最后，我们开发了三个开放世界评估基准，然后从广泛的视角进行大量实验，以验证我们的模型在战略行动和规划方面的能力。\n\n## 📈 实验结果\n实验结果表明，Steve-Eye在开放世界场景中显著优于基于LLM的智能体。具体来说，我们在以下三个基准上进行了评估：\n1. 环境视觉描述（ENV-VC）：评估智能体感知和描述其周围环境的能力。\n2. 基础知识问答（FK-QA）：评估智能体掌握对决策至关重要的基本知识的熟练程度。\n3. 技能预测与规划（SPP）：量化智能体在战略行动和规划方面的能力。\n\n## 💬 可借鉴之处\nSteve-Eye的研究成果为开发能够在开放世界中有效互动的具身智能体提供了重要的启示。其多模态感知、基础知识库和技能预测与规划功能为智能体在复杂环境中进行自主行动和规划提供了强大的支持。此外，Steve-Eye的开放世界评估基准为评估具身智能体的性能提供了有价值的参考。","llm_summary_res_status":200,"order":13,"query_answer":"## 💡 解答问题1 (介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」)\n\n这篇论文提出了三个开放世界的评估基准来评估智能体在开放世界中的交互能力：\n\n1. **环境视觉描述（ENV-VC）**：评估智能体感知和描述其周围环境的能力。智能体需要根据给定的快照描述其当前状态和周围环境特征，例如生命值、食物、装备等。\n\n2. **基础知识问答（FK-QA）**：评估智能体掌握对决策至关重要的基本知识的熟练程度。智能体需要回答关于Minecraft中物品、配方等基本知识的问答。\n\n3. **技能预测与规划（SPP）**：量化智能体在战略行动和规划方面的能力。智能体需要预测技能的执行状态（成功、失败、进行中）并生成可执行的高层次技能计划。\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？)\n\n论文中没有明确说明benchmark所需的设备条件。但是，根据论文内容，我们可以推测：\n\n* **训练设备**：由于模型规模较大，训练过程需要高性能的GPU和足够的内存。论文中提到使用了LLaMA-2模型作为LLM主干，CLIP作为视觉编码器，VQ-GAN作为视觉分词器，因此训练设备至少需要支持这些模型的GPU。\n\n* **推理设备**：推理过程对设备的要求相对较低，但仍然需要一定的计算能力。论文中提到使用了LoRA技术来降低推理成本，因此推理设备可以相对简单。\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？)\n\n论文中没有明确说明benchmark是否包含结果奖励或过程奖励。但是，根据论文内容，我们可以推测：\n\n* **结果奖励**：ENV-VC和FK-QA基准通过评估智能体对环境描述和知识问答的准确性来提供结果奖励。\n\n* **过程奖励**：SPP基准通过评估智能体对技能执行状态的预测和技能计划的生成来提供过程奖励。\n\n由于这些奖励都是基于智能体的实际表现，因此不容易出现reward hacking现象。这为RL类模型在benchmark上取得优异成绩提供了良好的基础。","query_answer_status":200}

Our benchmark and models are open-source for\nfuture research on creative agents (https:\/\/github.com\/PKU-\nRL\/Creative-Agents).\n1. Introduction\nBuilding open-ended embodied agents has been a long-\nstanding goal of AI research.\nUnlike many existing AI\nagents that perform a fixed set of tasks specified with re-\n*Equal contribution\n†Correspondence to B: zongqing.lu@pku.edu.cn\nwards [1, 19], open-ended agents can perform diverse arbi-\ntrary tasks without such specification. Existing research pri-\nmarily focuses on learning instruction-following agents [4,\n11, 29] that can solve open-ended tasks given free-form\nlanguage instructions, achieving success in robotic do-\nmains [4, 11, 24] and open-world games [6, 29, 45]. How-\never, these agents can only follow clear instructions that rep-\nresent specific goals or behaviors. Creative tasks, where the\ninstructions describe abstract tasks and the agent is required\nto generate complicated, novel, and diverse solutions, bring\nnew challenges to intelligent agents.\nAs an example, in the open-world game Minecraft, ex-\nisting agents can follow simple and clear instructions like\n‘harvest a stone’ [52] and ‘build a snow golem, which stacks\n2 snow blocks and 1 pumpkin’ [7], but they cannot solve\ncreative tasks like ‘build a sandstone palace’. For the latter,\nthe agent can struggle to understand the target outcome of\nthe task implied in the abstract instruction and plan actions\nfor the long-horizon execution where hundreds of blocks\nshould be properly placed. However, empowered with the\nability of imagination, humans can first imagine the appear-\nance and functionality of the building, then plan for a proper\norder to build blocks and realize the imagined house in the\ngame. Such ability enhances humans with strong creativ-\nity, enabling humans to create novel and diverse outcomes.\nImagination also enriches the fuzzy instructions into refined\ntask outcomes grounded in the environment, making the\ntask description more explicit and executable.\nMotivated by this ability, we introduce a framework for\ncreative agents, empowering open-ended agents with imagi-\nnation to solve creative tasks. Figure 1 gives an overview of\nthe framework. Equipped with a text-conditioned imagina-\ntor, creative agents can imagine the details of the task out-\ncome abstracted in the language instruction. These imag-\ninations serve as a blueprint for the controller to interpret\nand act upon. We propose two variants of the imaginator,\nincluding a large language model (LLM) [5] generating text\nimaginations and a finetuned diffusion model [38] generat-\ning grounded visual imaginations. We also introduce two\nvariants of the controller that transform the imagination into\nexecutable plans. The first is a behavior-cloning controller\ntrained on an environment dataset and maps imaginations\n1\narXiv:2312.02519v1  [cs.AI]  5 Dec 2023\n“build a \nsandstone \npalace”\nGPT-4(V)\nCode Gen.\nBC\nController\nImaginator\nController\nCreative Agents\nCreative Task\nCreation\n“1.

Overview of creative agents for open-ended creative tasks. A creative agent consists of two components: an imaginator and a\ncontroller. Given a free-form language instruction describing the creative task, the imaginator first generates the imagination in the form of\ntext\/image by LLM with Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\/diffusion model, then the controller fulfills the imagination by executing actions in the\nenvironment, leveraging the code generation capability of vision-language model (VLM) or a behavior-cloning (BC) policy learned from\ndata. We implement three combinations of the imaginator and controller: ①CoT+GPT-4, ②Diffusion+GPT-4V, and ③Diffusion+BC.\nto actions. The second method leverages the strong abili-\nties in vision-language understanding [51] and code gener-\nation [44] of the large vision-language model (VLM) GPT-\n4V [34]. The VLM controller receives the imagination as\nthe task goal and generates code to perform actions in the\nenvironment.\nDesigning evaluation metrics for open-ended tasks re-\nmains underexplored.\nExisting methods either use some\nsurrogate metrics [44] which may not reflect the language\ninstruction, or use human evaluation [7] which is labori-\nous. Fan et al. [13] proposes to use the similarity of the\nCLIP [37] embedding between vision and language, which\nhowever can only provide some unknown correlation be-\ntween the instruction and task outcome. To address these\nlimitations, we propose novel evaluation metrics based on\nGPT-4V. Leveraging the analytical strength of GPT-4V, our\nmetrics offer an effective, general, and human-independent\nmeans of evaluation. We verify that such metrics are con-\nsistent with human evaluations. Our proposed metrics are\ncrucial for objectively measuring the creativity and effec-\ntiveness of solutions generated by open-ended agents.\nWe benchmark creative tasks with challenging building\ncreation in Minecraft1, following 20 diverse instructions.\nSeveral variants of creative agents demonstrate their abil-\nity to create diverse and visually appealing buildings in the\nsurvival mode of Minecraft, which has never been achieved\nin previous studies. We give a detailed experimental analy-\n1We select the open-world game Minecraft as the benchmark platform\nbecause it is convenient to build various imaginators and controllers and\nalso supports creation in the game. Specifically, we choose the survival\nmode of Minecraft, where it is difficult for the agent to construct buildings\nsince the agent has to move around and go up\/down to place the blocks\nwith diverse materials and colors, making the building process realistic. It\nis worth noting that our framework for creative agents is general and can\nalso be applied to other environments.\nsis of creative agents, discuss the strengths and weaknesses\nof each variant, and provide insights for improving creative\nagents in future work.\nOur main contributions are threefold:\n• We propose creative agents, the first framework that en-\ndows open-ended agents with the ability to perform cre-\native tasks through imagination. Our method builds the\nfirst instruction-following agent that can create diverse\nbuildings in the survival mode of Minecraft.\n• We establish novel evaluation metrics for creative tasks\nin open-ended environments, in which GPT-4V is used as\nthe evaluator.\n• By open-sourcing the datasets and models, our work sets\na new benchmark for future research in the field of open-\nended learning and creative AI agents.\n2. Preliminaries\n2.1. Open-Ended Tasks\nWe formalize the process of the agent interacting with the\nenvironment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) without\nreward, defined by a tuple M = (S, A, P, ρ) representing\nstates, actions, the transition function of the environment,\nand the initial state distribution, respectively. Starting from\nthe initial state, for each time step, the agent performs an\naction based on the state, then the environment transitions\nto the next state upon the action.\nCompared with traditional reinforcement learning tasks\ndefined with reward functions, open-ended tasks have nei-\nther fixed targets nor optimal solutions. We follow Fan et al.\n[13], formulating open-ended tasks as instruction-following\nproblems T = (L, M), where l ∈L is a free-form language\ninstruction.\nWe aim to acquire an instruction-following\nagent P(a|s, l) which can exhibit behaviors consistent with\n2\nthe instruction to perform the described task.\n2.2. Creative Agents with Imagination\nDue to the abstract nature of language, language instruc-\ntions cannot describe the full details of complicated tasks,\ndrawing high uncertainty on the task completion and requir-\ning the agent to possess creativity.\nThough many open-\nended agents [6, 11, 29] can follow clear instructions that\nrefer to some specific task goals, none of them can follow\nsuch uncertain instructions to perform complicated tasks.\nWe define creative tasks as a challenging case of open-\nended tasks, where language instructions lack information\nto describe the whole task and can refer to diverse, novel,\nand complicated outcomes in the environment. Such in-\nstructions bring uncertainty for the agent and require the\nability to imagine the details unspecified by the instruction.\nIn addition, a short instruction (e.g. ‘build a house’) may re-\nfer to a long-horizon complicated task, increasing the chal-\nlenge for the action planning and execution.\nTo tackle the challenge, we propose to decompose the\nagent into an imaginator and a controller:\nP(a|s, l) =\nX\ng\nI(g|l)π(a|s, g, l).\n(1)\nHere, g ∈G is an imagination of the task outcome, which\ncan be in the form of diverse modalities (e.g. text, image)\nand serves as a description of the target environment state\nof the task. The imaginator I converts the instruction into\nan imagined outcome, providing the controller π with a de-\ntailed task description. Therefore, we leave the uncertainty\nand creativity brought from creative tasks to the imaginator,\nproviding the controller with richer task information to re-\nduce its uncertainty. By disentangling these two models, we\ncan delve deeper into the design choices for each part and\ncombine them together to build creative agents.\n3. Generative Imagination\nGenerative models in natural language processing and com-\nputer vision provide techniques to build the imaginator in\neither text space or image space. In this section, we present\ntwo variants for implementing the imaginator.\n3.1. Language Models for Textual Imagination\nLarge language models (LLMs) have shown marvelous\nabilities in solving diverse tasks [9, 46] as well as high plas-\nticity with prompt engineering [5, 48]. To tackle the prob-\nlems in reasoning logically, Wei et al. [47] proposed Chain-\nof-Thought (CoT), aimed at enhancing the emergence abil-\nity of LLMs.\nFollowing the idea of zero-shot-CoT [28], we design\nan imaginator using GPT-4 [34] as the backbone, with zero-\nshot prompts for imagination in Minecraft building-creation\ndomain (please refer to Appendix B). Specifically, we pro-\nvide the initial text instruction to GPT-4 and ask five ques-\ntions relevant to the imagination, including the material\nused for the building, the approximate size, the significant\nfeatures of the architecture, etc. After GPT-4 generates an-\nswers to these questions indicating that the imagination pro-\ncess has been finished, we then ask the controller to exe-\ncute actions accordingly to construct the building (see Sec-\ntion 4).\n3.2. Diffusion Models for Visual Imagination\nDiffusion models have achieved breakthrough performance\nin generating diverse and high-quality images. Stable Dif-\nfusion [38] models data distribution as the stationary state\nof a diffusion process, learning to generate samples mir-\nroring the true data distribution by reversing this process.\nNoteworthy for its training stability, it addresses issues like\nmode collapse.\nTo better align with the human conception of “imagi-\nnation”, we use images to be the imagination space and\nleverage text-conditioned diffusion models to be the imag-\ninator. We finetune the Stable Diffusion [38] using a text-\nimage dataset to achieve a reasonable and diverse imagina-\ntion of textual input. The text-image pairs in the dataset\nare constructed by automatically annotating the Minecraft\nbuildings in CraftAssist [16] using the multimodal Emu\nmodel [42]. After finetuning, we obtain visually plausible\nand diverse imaginations that align with both the textual de-\nscriptions and the Minecraft world.\n4. Designing Controllers\nAfter the imaginator generates the imagination g, it is the\ncontroller to take actions in the environment, conditioned\non the current state, the imagination, and the language in-\nstruction. In the following, two variants of the controller\nare presented, including a behavior-cloning controller and a\ncontroller based on GPT-4(V).\n4.1. Behavior-Cloning Controller\nTo transform the imagination into a practical construction\nprocess, we introduce a behavior-cloning controller that\nfirst converts the image imagination into a blueprint and\nthen maps the blueprint into tangible actions.\nFor tasks related to constructing buildings in Minecraft,\nwe use voxel information as the basis for blueprints. To\nlearn a module generating voxel blueprints conditioned\non images, we adopt the methodology introduced by\nPix2Vox++ [50], utilizing the image-voxel dataset con-\nstructed through data augmentation from original construc-\ntions in CraftAssist [16] and ISM [14].\nThe module is\ntrained to optimize a combination of the voxel predic-\ntion loss and two regularization terms, including the occu-\npancy rate loss [36] and the total variation loss [39, 49].\n3\nSubsequently, for the construction process, we employ\nResNet3D-CNN[20] and train a behavior-cloning (BC) pol-\nicy on a collected voxel-action dataset. After that, the fi-\nnal construction is executed by the BC policy conditioned\non the voxel information through path-searching and block-\nplacing within the MineDojo simulator [13]. More details\nabout our methods and datasets are available in Appendix B.\n4.2. Vision-Language Models as Controller\nWe also adopt a generative vision-language model (VLM)\nto construct the controller, which can perceive both visual\nimaginations and textual imaginations. Utilizing its abili-\nties in task reasoning and code generation, given an envi-\nronment code interface that wraps actions, the VLM can\ngenerate executable code in the environment for task com-\npletion.\nSpecifically, we use GPT-4(V) which takes as input an\nimage generated by the diffusion imaginator or the textual\nimagination generated by the LLM with CoT. We ask GPT-\n4(V) to generate code that can call Mineflayer [35] APIs to\nexecute environment actions for building creation. Mine-\nflayer implements JavaScript APIs for diverse skill primi-\ntives in the Minecraft world. Following the prompt design\nin Voyager [44], we provide GPT-4(V) with API documen-\ntation to clarify the coding rules and a one-shot example of\ncode generation for in-context learning. More details about\nthe prompts are available in Appendix B.\nWith this controller, we implement creative agents in\nboth two modalities of imaginations.\n5. Experiments\n5.1. Building Creation in Minecraft\nInspired by the creative tasks in MineDojo [13], we set\nup an evaluation benchmark for constructing buildings in\nMinecraft, consisting of 20 diverse language instructions,\nsuch as “a huge Minecraft volcano built of ice” as illustrated\nin Figure 4. Following the text description, the agent takes\nactions to move and place blocks in the game simulator to\ncreate buildings. In the experiment, we aim to investigate\nwhether the agent can construct novel, diverse buildings by\njust following language instructions, which reflects the cre-\nativity of the agent. In the evaluation, we take screenshots\nof its creations in the game. More details can be found in\nAppendix A. We setup various metrics to evaluate the open-\nended building creation tasks and apply two evaluators, in-\ncluding human evaluators and a novel evaluator based on\nGPT-4V. Section 5.3 presents the evaluation details.\n5.2. Implementation\nWe implement several variants of creative agents using dif-\nferent combinations of imaginators and controllers (more\nCorrectness\nComplexity\nQuality\nFunctionality\nRobustness\n6.95\n4.90\n6.35\n4.15\n4.07\nVanilla GPT-4\nCoT+GPT-4\nDiffusion+GPT-4V\nDiffusion+BC\nFigure 2.\nComparison of all variants of creative agents in\nMinecraft building creation.

We simply\nreplace the textual imagination with the original task in-\nstruction and ask GPT-4 to perform code generation.\n• CoT+GPT-4. We implement this agent by adding a CoT-\nimagination on the basis of Vanilla GPT-4, which means\nwe use GPT-4 for both textual imagination and code gen-\neration (method ①in Figure 1).\n• Diffusion+GPT-4V2. We use a finetuned Stable Diffu-\nsion to generate images as imagination and use GPT-4V\nas the controller to generate codes based on the visual\nimagination (method ②in Figure 1).\n• Diffusion+BC. The finetuned Stable Diffusion is used as\nthe imaginator while the behavior-cloning controller is\nused to convert images into voxel blueprints and execute\nactions.(method ③in Figure 1).\n5.3. Evaluation Metrics\nBased on existing evaluation methods in open-ended learn-\ning [30] and content generation in Minecraft [40], we intro-\nduce a set of evaluation aspects, which are important criteria\nfor creative agents:\n• Correctness. Are the creations consistent with the lan-\nguage instruction?\n• Complexity.\nCan the agent create large and complex\nbuildings?\n2We use GPT-4V here to indicate the agent additionally takes an image\nimagination as input.\n4\nDiffusion+GPT-4V CoT+GPT-4\nDiffusion+BC\nVanilla GPT-4\n1000\n1100\n1200\n1300\n1400\n1500\n1600\nElo Rating\n1531.0\n1441.0\n1395.0\n1233.0\nElo Ratings of Different Agents\nVanilla GPT-4\nCoT+GPT-4\nDiffusion+GPT-4V\nDiffusion+BC\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\nAverage Score\n18.1\n21.2\n22.4\n19.8\n19.1\n21.1\n23.2\n17.8\nAverage Score of Different Agents\nGPT-4V\nHumans\nFigure 3.

Right:\nThe average overall score of each agent in all test tasks evaluated by GPT-4V and humans.\n• Quality. Do the creations have a good visual appearance\nfrom the perspective of aesthetics?\n• Functionality. Do the created buildings have the neces-\nsary functions and structures (such as windows and en-\ntrances)?\nTo quantitatively evaluate such metrics, recent work [7]\nrequires humans to perform evaluation, which however is\nlabor-intensive and may be susceptible to subject prefer-\nences. To tackle these issues, we leverage the strong ca-\npabilities of the recent VLMs in vision-language reasoning\nand vision question answering and propose two VLM-based\nevaluation methods.\nIn the first method, given a language instruction, we sam-\nple a pair of creation results from two methods and fill in a\ntemplate to ask the VLM which one is better overall based\non all evaluation metrics:\nYou are a critic with high aesthetic ability. I\nwill provide you a text instruction and two\nbuildings created by different agents\nfollowing this instruction in the game \"\nMinecraft\".\nPlease evaluate their overall performance\naccording to four aspects: $(\nEVALUATION_ASPECT 1˜4). Tell me which\nbuilding in the image is better (left or\nright).\nText: $(INSTRUCTION)\nImage of buildings: $(IMAGE1, IMAGE2)\nWe use the Elo Rating System [12] to measure the relative\nstrength of each agent.\nIn the second method, we fill in a template with the four\nevaluation metrics above to ask the VLM to directly score\nfor each building:\nYou are a critic with high aesthetic ability. I\nwill provide you a text instruction and a\ncreated building following this instruction\nin the game \"Minecraft\".\nAccording to four aspects: $(EVALUATION_ASPECT\n1˜4),\nplease evaluate the building with a score (out of\n10) on each aspect respectively, then give a\ntotal score.\nText: $(INSTRUCTION)\nImage of the building: $IMAGE\nTo verify the reliability of VLMs in evaluation, we also ask\nhumans to participate in both two evaluation methods and\ncompare the difference between VLM and human evalua-\ntions.\n5.4. Results and Analysis\nIn the first evaluation method, every two agents are com-\npared by GPT-4V for each test task. With all these com-\nparison results, we model the four agents into a four-player\nzero-sum game and apply the Elo Rating System to com-\npute the ratings, as shown in Figure 3 (left).\nAccording to the second evaluation method, we record\nratings of each single test over the four metrics (correctness,\ncomplexity, quality, and functionality), the sum of which is\nthe overall score. We calculate the standard deviation of the\noverall scores of all test tasks for each agent, which repre-\nsents Robustness, with a larger standard deviation standing\nfor weaker robustness. To align with the other four metrics\nfor better presentation, we properly transform the standard\ndeviation into a value such that a higher value indicates bet-\nter robustness. Note that better robustness does not neces-\nsarily mean better performance since it merely indicates the\nconsistency of the performance on all test tasks. The results\nare plotted as a polar chart shown in Figure 2. Furthermore,\nthe overall score averaged over all test tasks for each agent\nis shown in Figure 3 (right). Figure 4 shows examples of\nthe language description, the generated visual imagination,\nand the created building of each agent.\nAnalyzing the experimental results, we can draw the fol-\nlowing primal conclusions:\n• CoT for textual imagination can effectively enrich the\ndetailed features of the target buildings.\n5\nComparing CoT+GPT-4 with Vanilla GPT-4, the for-\nmer outperforms the latter in terms of all metrics ex-\ncept robustness in the polar chart by a large margin, and\nCoT+GPT-4 obtains a higher score in the Elo Rating re-\nsults than Vanilla GPT-4. We assign this due to the rich\ninformation brought by Chain-of-Thought, which plays a\nrole in self-reflection. Through this process, the LLM gets\na better understanding of the details of the task, including\nbut not limited to the materials used, the size of the build-\ning, the significant features, etc. Within the context of a\nconversation, when GPT-4 generates the code in the sec-\nond round, it can still perceive the extra information from\nthe first round, thus reaching a better representation of the\ntask goal.\n• For the controller, using VLM instead of LLM leads\nto a marginally better performance in most metrics.\nAs shown in Figure 2, Diffusion+GPT-4V weakly sur-\npasses CoT+GPT-4 in correctness, complexity, quality,\nand robustness. However, Diffusion+GPT-4V strikes a tie\nwith CoT+GPT-4 in functionality. In terms of functional-\nity, Diffusion+GPT-4V behaves no better than CoT+GPT-\n4, which can be owing to the weak ability of GPT-4V\nin 3D reconstruction. Empirically, the images passed to\nGPT-4V are usually a complete building generated by the\ndiffusion-based imaginator, without the sectional view to\nshow the internal structures. Therefore, sometimes GPT-\n4V tends to write code that leads to a solid house instead\nof a hollow one. According to the criteria of functionality,\nsolid houses can result in low ratings.\n• Diffsion+GPT-4V has the best performance overall,\nshowing a strong ability of anti-interference and ro-\nbustness.\nIn Figure 3, both the Elo Rating results and the average\nscore show that the three variants proposed in Figure 1\noutperform the baseline to varying degrees, among which\nDiffsion+GPT-4V ranks the first. Combining the previous\ntwo conclusions, Diffusion+GPT-4V has both the advan-\ntage in visual imagination and the strengths from CoT,\nthus having a better performance. Additionally, we are\nsurprised to find that Diffusion+GPT-4V overcomes the\nmisleading information of the diffusion-based imaginator.\nIn about half of the test tasks, the images generated by the\ndiffusion-based imaginator tend to have obvious noises in\nthe background to some extent. However, GPT-4V seems\nto have the ability of anti-interference, thus capturing the\nmajor essential factors of the images. In contrast, Dif-\nfusion+BC may be susceptible to such noises, leading to\nweaker robustness.\n• The human-rating results coincide with the VLM-\nrating results with a minor gap, indicating that evalu-\nating by vision-language models is reliable.\nWe list the average scores by both VLM and human evalu-\nTable 1. Consistency between VLM and human evaluations. Here,\n“agreement” refers to the proportion of cases where the pairwise\ncomparison between four variants of creative agents has the same\nnumerical relationship in both VLM and human evaluations.\nMetric\n1v1\nOverall\nscore\nCorrect.\nscore\nCompl.\nscore\nQual.\nscore\nFunc.\nscore\nAgreement 62.5%\n67%\n68%\n71%\n62%\n52%\nation in Figure 3 (right), from which we know the human-\nrating results are generally in line with the VLM-rating\nresults. In both evaluations, the first two in the ranking\nare the same - Diffusion+GPT-4V and CoT+GPT-4. The\nlast two are in the opposite order but within a small gap.\nOverall, both two evaluations agree that Diffusion+GPT-\n4V has the best performance.\n• The buildings created by agents are relatively simple,\nlimited by the code written by language models and\nthe trained policy of the behavior-cloning controller.\nIn the analysis of the final creations of different agents,\nwe find that the buildings are relatively simple. For those\nvariants with GPT-4(V) controllers, this may be limited\nby the code written by GPT-4(V). Due to limited APIs\nin Mineflayer, GPT-4(V) tends to generate simple code.\nFor instance, GPT-4(V) tends to use for-loops in a piece\nof code that corresponds to a wall in the building, re-\nsulting in the square shape of the building.\nAddition-\nally, Mineflayer uses a rule-based algorithm for path plan-\nning to place blocks in the Minecraft world, and the agent\nwill always destroy some blocks when not able to find\na proper path toward the goal. Therefore, there can be\nmany demolished walls in the final creations.\nOn the\nother hand, the trained policy of the behavior-cloning\ncontroller has several limitations. When reconstructing\nvoxels from the images generated by the diffusion-based\nimaginator, the Pix2Vox approach can only capture the\nRGB color for each voxel and choose the most similar\nblock in Minecraft, which is not very accurate. To make\nthings worse, the plausible structure of a common build-\ning is missed out during the reconstruction, which makes\nthe voxel look like “a mess”. Some blocks are even float-\ning in the voxel, so they cannot be placed correctly in the\nfinal execution. This also provides a reason why Diffu-\nsion+BC ranks the last in the human evaluation results.\n5.5. The VLM Evaluator vs. Human Evaluators\nIn human evaluation, for the first evaluation method (1v1\ncomparison), we use the majority vote among all humans\n(49 human evaluators in total) to represent human prefer-\nence for each pair of buildings. For the second evaluation\nmethod, the scoring data from each human is standardized\nin each of the four evaluation metrics and the overall score.\n6\n“A huge Minecraft volcano built of ice.”\n“A tall Minecraft tower with glass windows, \nmainly built of leaves.”\n“A big Minecraft house built of colorful \nwools.”\n“A slender Minecraft tower with crystal-\nclear windows, predominantly crafted from \nbirch logs.”\n“A yellow concrete Minecraft house with a \nroof and windows.”\n“A sandstone palace in Minecraft with \nintricate details and towering minarets.”\n“A mystical ice castle in Minecraft, sculpted \nfrom packed ice and frosted blocks, adorned \nwith icicle chandeliers and frosty spires.”\n“A medieval-inspired fortress in Minecraft \nbuilt from cobblestone and mossy stone \nbricks, complete with imposing towers and a \ndrawbridge.”\nDiffusion Image\nVanilla GPT-4\nCoT+GPT-4\nDiffusion+GPT-4V\nDiffusion+BC\nText Description\n“An enchanting Minecraft pagoda adorned \nwith bamboo and built primarily of jungle \nwood planks.”\n“A pyramid in Minecraft built of sandstone.”\nFigure 4. Examples of the language description, the generated visual imagination, and the created building of each variant of creative\nagents. Visual imagination generated by the diffusion model has great diversity, which is an important manifestation of creativity.\nThen we take the average score from all humans as the\nhuman evaluation score for each building created by each\nagent. To measure the consistency of human and VLM eval-\nuators, we use “agreement”, which refers to the proportion\nof cases where the pairwise comparison between four vari-\nants of creative agents has the same numerical relationship\nin both human and VLM evaluations under each evaluation\nmetric.\nThe agreements of human and VLM evaluations are\nlisted in Table 1.\nThe agreement in the overall score is\n67%, greater than two-thirds, indicating that the VLM eval-\nuation is consistent with human evaluation to some extent,\nthough each metric may have a slightly different agreement.\nMoreover, the agreement in 1v1 is 62.5%, relatively lower\nthan that in the overall score, but they are reasonably consis-\ntent. Together with human and VLM evaluations reaching a\nconsensus that Diffusion+GPT-4V has the best performance\nfollowed by CoT+GPT-4, as shown in Figure 3 (right), we\nbelieve the VLM evaluator can be a good choice for creative\ntasks.\n7\n6. Related Work\n6.1. Open-Ended Agents\nIn recent years, task learning in open-ended worlds has at-\ntracted increasing attention, among which Minecraft [25]\nhas become a marvelous test-bed for open-ended learn-\ning. MineRL [18] and MineDojo [13] implemented sim-\nulated environments and organized datasets of a relatively\nlarge scale, and the latter provides tasks for agent train-\ning in the open-ended domain.\nHowever, most previous\nwork [3, 29, 45, 52] mainly focused on unlocking numerous\nskills and tackling long-horizon tasks in Minecraft, which\nhowever are mostly predefined, lacking the open-ended na-\nture, not to mention creativity.\nThe IGLU Competition [27] was a giant leap to solving\ntasks according to instructions in natural language. Skryn-\nnik et al. [41] proposed a pipeline containing a T5-based\nlanguage module, a rule-based transfer module, and the\ndownstream policy module for execution. This agent could\nsolve simple tasks of stacking blocks in Gridworld [53], a\nMinecraft-like open-ended world. However, it depended on\ntoo many step-by-step instructions, thus showing little cre-\nativity. In general, there is a significant gap between previ-\nous work and the true “creative agents”.\n6.2. Generative Models\nIn recent years, many modern generative models have been\nproposed and are used to produce high-quality samples in\nvarious domains [8]. Text-generative models have aroused\nmuch attention due to their wide range of uses. Especially,\nlarge language models (LLMs) are playing more and more\nsignificant roles in decision-making, planning, and reason-\ning.\nAmong LLMs, a representative one is GPT-4 [34],\nwhose emergence has laid a solid foundation for further re-\nsearch. Accompanied by the appearance of LLMs, prompt\nengineering and tuning techniques [5, 48] have been widely\nstudied and applied, including Parameter-Efficient Fine-\nTuning (PEFT) [21] and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [47]. In\nour work, LLMs with CoT are adopted as textual imagina-\ntors, and we also construct the text-based controller with\nLLM code generation.\nIn the field of computer vision, image-generative mod-\nels are becoming increasingly important.\nProminent ap-\nproaches include variational autoencoders (VAEs) [26],\nGenerative\nAdversarial\nNetworks\n(GANs)\n[15],\nand\nflows [22], demonstrating success in capturing image dis-\ntributions and representations. Recently, diffusion models\n[23] and DALL-E 3 [33] are springing up, accelerating the\nresearch in visual generation. In our work, a finetuned Sta-\nble Diffusion [38] is used for visual imagination, represent-\ning a concrete description of the building-creation task.\nIn the Minecraft world, previous work [2, 17, 40] fo-\ncuses on Procedural Content Generation (PCG). However,\nthey usually generate a pre-defined type of buildings with\na lot of human prior knowledge. In our work, imagination\nfor creative agents is similar to content generation, but our\nimaginator can generate with free-form instructions, in dif-\nferent modalities, and requiring much less human prior.\n6.3. Evaluation for Open-Ended Tasks\nRecent work has gathered many evaluation methods for\nopen-ended tasks. Voyager [44], STEVE-1 [29], and DIP-\nRL [32] use travel distance and collected items as surro-\ngate metrics to evaluate. GROOT [7] and BASALT compe-\ntition [31] use human evaluation, which is relatively labor-\nintensive and may be susceptible to subject preferences. Re-\ncent work [10, 13] proposes to use the CLIP-like model to\ncompute alignment between the behaviors and instructions.\nWe propose a novel evaluation method using VLMs, which\ncan either directly rate the performance in various aspects\nor conduct pairwise comparisons.\nIn terms of evaluation aspects, previous studies have pro-\nposed a variety of metrics. MCU [30] took evaluations from\nthe perspective of planning complexity, time consumption,\nnovelty, and creativity. GDMC Competition [40] required\nhumans as judges, rating the generated contents from adapt-\nability, functionality, evocative narrative, as well as visual\naesthetics. Team et al. [43] evaluated the results in both task\ncoverage and relative performance. Inspired by these stud-\nies, we adopt the evaluation aspects in correctness, com-\nplexity, quality, functionality, and robustness.\n7. Conclusion and Limitations\nIn this paper, we propose creative agents, which is the first\nframework that can handle creative tasks in an open-ended\nworld. Using this framework, we implement various em-\nbodied agents through different combinations of imagina-\ntors and controllers. Additionally, we tap into the potential\nof Vision-Language Models (VLMs), utilizing VLMs for\nevaluation as judges. By comparing the rating results from\nVLM and humans, we illustrate the reliability of VLM eval-\nuation.\nIn the meanwhile, we find a few limitations of these cre-\native agents, to be investigated in further work. First, there\nis much room for improving the BC controller, especially\nfor the performance of Pix2Vox module. Another limitation\nlies in the simplicity of the building created by the agents,\nwhich means the capabilities of these agents are limited.\nHow to enhance the creativity of agents can be a challeng-\ning problem.\nIn the end, we declare that creative agents is an initial\nattempt in this field, aimed at raising the awareness of build-\ning intelligent agents with creativity. We hope this work can\nbe of inspiration for further research.\n8","pdf_path":"tools\/arxiv_tools\/asset\/pdf\/\/Creative Agents: Empowering Agents with Imagination for Creative Tasks.pdf","query_prompt":"### 任务\n你是一个人工智能领域的专家，你能够快速阅读arxiv上的各种AI前沿论文和相关博客，进而完美地回答学生的问题。\n现在请你阅读以下论文及博客，并回答学生的问题。\n\n### 论文信息\n###  1. 论文标题\n```\nCreative Agents: Empowering Agents with Imagination for Creative Tasks\n```\n#### 2. 论文摘要\n```\nWe study building embodied agents for open-ended creative tasks.

Introduction\nBuilding open-ended embodied agents has been a long-\nstanding goal of AI research.\nUnlike many existing AI\nagents that perform a fixed set of tasks specified with re-\n*Equal contribution\n†Correspondence to B: zongqing.lu@pku.edu.cn\nwards [1, 19], open-ended agents can perform diverse arbi-\ntrary tasks without such specification. Existing research pri-\nmarily focuses on learning instruction-following agents [4,\n11, 29] that can solve open-ended tasks given free-form\nlanguage instructions, achieving success in robotic do-\nmains [4, 11, 24] and open-world games [6, 29, 45]. How-\never, these agents can only follow clear instructions that rep-\nresent specific goals or behaviors. Creative tasks, where the\ninstructions describe abstract tasks and the agent is required\nto generate complicated, novel, and diverse solutions, bring\nnew challenges to intelligent agents.\nAs an example, in the open-world game Minecraft, ex-\nisting agents can follow simple and clear instructions like\n‘harvest a stone’ [52] and ‘build a snow golem, which stacks\n2 snow blocks and 1 pumpkin’ [7], but they cannot solve\ncreative tasks like ‘build a sandstone palace’. For the latter,\nthe agent can struggle to understand the target outcome of\nthe task implied in the abstract instruction and plan actions\nfor the long-horizon execution where hundreds of blocks\nshould be properly placed. However, empowered with the\nability of imagination, humans can first imagine the appear-\nance and functionality of the building, then plan for a proper\norder to build blocks and realize the imagined house in the\ngame. Such ability enhances humans with strong creativ-\nity, enabling humans to create novel and diverse outcomes.\nImagination also enriches the fuzzy instructions into refined\ntask outcomes grounded in the environment, making the\ntask description more explicit and executable.\nMotivated by this ability, we introduce a framework for\ncreative agents, empowering open-ended agents with imagi-\nnation to solve creative tasks. Figure 1 gives an overview of\nthe framework. Equipped with a text-conditioned imagina-\ntor, creative agents can imagine the details of the task out-\ncome abstracted in the language instruction. These imag-\ninations serve as a blueprint for the controller to interpret\nand act upon. We propose two variants of the imaginator,\nincluding a large language model (LLM) [5] generating text\nimaginations and a finetuned diffusion model [38] generat-\ning grounded visual imaginations. We also introduce two\nvariants of the controller that transform the imagination into\nexecutable plans. The first is a behavior-cloning controller\ntrained on an environment dataset and maps imaginations\n1\narXiv:2312.02519v1  [cs.AI]  5 Dec 2023\n“build a \nsandstone \npalace”\nGPT-4(V)\nCode Gen.\nBC\nController\nImaginator\nController\nCreative Agents\nCreative Task\nCreation\n“1.

Overview of creative agents for open-ended creative tasks. A creative agent consists of two components: an imaginator and a\ncontroller. Given a free-form language instruction describing the creative task, the imaginator first generates the imagination in the form of\ntext\/image by LLM with Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\/diffusion model, then the controller fulfills the imagination by executing actions in the\nenvironment, leveraging the code generation capability of vision-language model (VLM) or a behavior-cloning (BC) policy learned from\ndata. We implement three combinations of the imaginator and controller: ①CoT+GPT-4, ②Diffusion+GPT-4V, and ③Diffusion+BC.\nto actions. The second method leverages the strong abili-\nties in vision-language understanding [51] and code gener-\nation [44] of the large vision-language model (VLM) GPT-\n4V [34]. The VLM controller receives the imagination as\nthe task goal and generates code to perform actions in the\nenvironment.\nDesigning evaluation metrics for open-ended tasks re-\nmains underexplored.\nExisting methods either use some\nsurrogate metrics [44] which may not reflect the language\ninstruction, or use human evaluation [7] which is labori-\nous. Fan et al. [13] proposes to use the similarity of the\nCLIP [37] embedding between vision and language, which\nhowever can only provide some unknown correlation be-\ntween the instruction and task outcome. To address these\nlimitations, we propose novel evaluation metrics based on\nGPT-4V. Leveraging the analytical strength of GPT-4V, our\nmetrics offer an effective, general, and human-independent\nmeans of evaluation. We verify that such metrics are con-\nsistent with human evaluations. Our proposed metrics are\ncrucial for objectively measuring the creativity and effec-\ntiveness of solutions generated by open-ended agents.\nWe benchmark creative tasks with challenging building\ncreation in Minecraft1, following 20 diverse instructions.\nSeveral variants of creative agents demonstrate their abil-\nity to create diverse and visually appealing buildings in the\nsurvival mode of Minecraft, which has never been achieved\nin previous studies. We give a detailed experimental analy-\n1We select the open-world game Minecraft as the benchmark platform\nbecause it is convenient to build various imaginators and controllers and\nalso supports creation in the game. Specifically, we choose the survival\nmode of Minecraft, where it is difficult for the agent to construct buildings\nsince the agent has to move around and go up\/down to place the blocks\nwith diverse materials and colors, making the building process realistic. It\nis worth noting that our framework for creative agents is general and can\nalso be applied to other environments.\nsis of creative agents, discuss the strengths and weaknesses\nof each variant, and provide insights for improving creative\nagents in future work.\nOur main contributions are threefold:\n• We propose creative agents, the first framework that en-\ndows open-ended agents with the ability to perform cre-\native tasks through imagination. Our method builds the\nfirst instruction-following agent that can create diverse\nbuildings in the survival mode of Minecraft.\n• We establish novel evaluation metrics for creative tasks\nin open-ended environments, in which GPT-4V is used as\nthe evaluator.\n• By open-sourcing the datasets and models, our work sets\na new benchmark for future research in the field of open-\nended learning and creative AI agents.\n2. Preliminaries\n2.1. Open-Ended Tasks\nWe formalize the process of the agent interacting with the\nenvironment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) without\nreward, defined by a tuple M = (S, A, P, ρ) representing\nstates, actions, the transition function of the environment,\nand the initial state distribution, respectively. Starting from\nthe initial state, for each time step, the agent performs an\naction based on the state, then the environment transitions\nto the next state upon the action.\nCompared with traditional reinforcement learning tasks\ndefined with reward functions, open-ended tasks have nei-\nther fixed targets nor optimal solutions. We follow Fan et al.\n[13], formulating open-ended tasks as instruction-following\nproblems T = (L, M), where l ∈L is a free-form language\ninstruction.\nWe aim to acquire an instruction-following\nagent P(a|s, l) which can exhibit behaviors consistent with\n2\nthe instruction to perform the described task.\n2.2. Creative Agents with Imagination\nDue to the abstract nature of language, language instruc-\ntions cannot describe the full details of complicated tasks,\ndrawing high uncertainty on the task completion and requir-\ning the agent to possess creativity.\nThough many open-\nended agents [6, 11, 29] can follow clear instructions that\nrefer to some specific task goals, none of them can follow\nsuch uncertain instructions to perform complicated tasks.\nWe define creative tasks as a challenging case of open-\nended tasks, where language instructions lack information\nto describe the whole task and can refer to diverse, novel,\nand complicated outcomes in the environment. Such in-\nstructions bring uncertainty for the agent and require the\nability to imagine the details unspecified by the instruction.\nIn addition, a short instruction (e.g. ‘build a house’) may re-\nfer to a long-horizon complicated task, increasing the chal-\nlenge for the action planning and execution.\nTo tackle the challenge, we propose to decompose the\nagent into an imaginator and a controller:\nP(a|s, l) =\nX\ng\nI(g|l)π(a|s, g, l).\n(1)\nHere, g ∈G is an imagination of the task outcome, which\ncan be in the form of diverse modalities (e.g. text, image)\nand serves as a description of the target environment state\nof the task. The imaginator I converts the instruction into\nan imagined outcome, providing the controller π with a de-\ntailed task description. Therefore, we leave the uncertainty\nand creativity brought from creative tasks to the imaginator,\nproviding the controller with richer task information to re-\nduce its uncertainty. By disentangling these two models, we\ncan delve deeper into the design choices for each part and\ncombine them together to build creative agents.\n3. Generative Imagination\nGenerative models in natural language processing and com-\nputer vision provide techniques to build the imaginator in\neither text space or image space. In this section, we present\ntwo variants for implementing the imaginator.\n3.1. Language Models for Textual Imagination\nLarge language models (LLMs) have shown marvelous\nabilities in solving diverse tasks [9, 46] as well as high plas-\nticity with prompt engineering [5, 48]. To tackle the prob-\nlems in reasoning logically, Wei et al. [47] proposed Chain-\nof-Thought (CoT), aimed at enhancing the emergence abil-\nity of LLMs.\nFollowing the idea of zero-shot-CoT [28], we design\nan imaginator using GPT-4 [34] as the backbone, with zero-\nshot prompts for imagination in Minecraft building-creation\ndomain (please refer to Appendix B). Specifically, we pro-\nvide the initial text instruction to GPT-4 and ask five ques-\ntions relevant to the imagination, including the material\nused for the building, the approximate size, the significant\nfeatures of the architecture, etc. After GPT-4 generates an-\nswers to these questions indicating that the imagination pro-\ncess has been finished, we then ask the controller to exe-\ncute actions accordingly to construct the building (see Sec-\ntion 4).\n3.2. Diffusion Models for Visual Imagination\nDiffusion models have achieved breakthrough performance\nin generating diverse and high-quality images. Stable Dif-\nfusion [38] models data distribution as the stationary state\nof a diffusion process, learning to generate samples mir-\nroring the true data distribution by reversing this process.\nNoteworthy for its training stability, it addresses issues like\nmode collapse.\nTo better align with the human conception of “imagi-\nnation”, we use images to be the imagination space and\nleverage text-conditioned diffusion models to be the imag-\ninator. We finetune the Stable Diffusion [38] using a text-\nimage dataset to achieve a reasonable and diverse imagina-\ntion of textual input. The text-image pairs in the dataset\nare constructed by automatically annotating the Minecraft\nbuildings in CraftAssist [16] using the multimodal Emu\nmodel [42]. After finetuning, we obtain visually plausible\nand diverse imaginations that align with both the textual de-\nscriptions and the Minecraft world.\n4. Designing Controllers\nAfter the imaginator generates the imagination g, it is the\ncontroller to take actions in the environment, conditioned\non the current state, the imagination, and the language in-\nstruction. In the following, two variants of the controller\nare presented, including a behavior-cloning controller and a\ncontroller based on GPT-4(V).\n4.1. Behavior-Cloning Controller\nTo transform the imagination into a practical construction\nprocess, we introduce a behavior-cloning controller that\nfirst converts the image imagination into a blueprint and\nthen maps the blueprint into tangible actions.\nFor tasks related to constructing buildings in Minecraft,\nwe use voxel information as the basis for blueprints. To\nlearn a module generating voxel blueprints conditioned\non images, we adopt the methodology introduced by\nPix2Vox++ [50], utilizing the image-voxel dataset con-\nstructed through data augmentation from original construc-\ntions in CraftAssist [16] and ISM [14].\nThe module is\ntrained to optimize a combination of the voxel predic-\ntion loss and two regularization terms, including the occu-\npancy rate loss [36] and the total variation loss [39, 49].\n3\nSubsequently, for the construction process, we employ\nResNet3D-CNN[20] and train a behavior-cloning (BC) pol-\nicy on a collected voxel-action dataset. After that, the fi-\nnal construction is executed by the BC policy conditioned\non the voxel information through path-searching and block-\nplacing within the MineDojo simulator [13]. More details\nabout our methods and datasets are available in Appendix B.\n4.2. Vision-Language Models as Controller\nWe also adopt a generative vision-language model (VLM)\nto construct the controller, which can perceive both visual\nimaginations and textual imaginations. Utilizing its abili-\nties in task reasoning and code generation, given an envi-\nronment code interface that wraps actions, the VLM can\ngenerate executable code in the environment for task com-\npletion.\nSpecifically, we use GPT-4(V) which takes as input an\nimage generated by the diffusion imaginator or the textual\nimagination generated by the LLM with CoT. We ask GPT-\n4(V) to generate code that can call Mineflayer [35] APIs to\nexecute environment actions for building creation. Mine-\nflayer implements JavaScript APIs for diverse skill primi-\ntives in the Minecraft world. Following the prompt design\nin Voyager [44], we provide GPT-4(V) with API documen-\ntation to clarify the coding rules and a one-shot example of\ncode generation for in-context learning. More details about\nthe prompts are available in Appendix B.\nWith this controller, we implement creative agents in\nboth two modalities of imaginations.\n5. Experiments\n5.1. Building Creation in Minecraft\nInspired by the creative tasks in MineDojo [13], we set\nup an evaluation benchmark for constructing buildings in\nMinecraft, consisting of 20 diverse language instructions,\nsuch as “a huge Minecraft volcano built of ice” as illustrated\nin Figure 4. Following the text description, the agent takes\nactions to move and place blocks in the game simulator to\ncreate buildings. In the experiment, we aim to investigate\nwhether the agent can construct novel, diverse buildings by\njust following language instructions, which reflects the cre-\nativity of the agent. In the evaluation, we take screenshots\nof its creations in the game. More details can be found in\nAppendix A. We setup various metrics to evaluate the open-\nended building creation tasks and apply two evaluators, in-\ncluding human evaluators and a novel evaluator based on\nGPT-4V. Section 5.3 presents the evaluation details.\n5.2.

We simply\nreplace the textual imagination with the original task in-\nstruction and ask GPT-4 to perform code generation.\n• CoT+GPT-4. We implement this agent by adding a CoT-\nimagination on the basis of Vanilla GPT-4, which means\nwe use GPT-4 for both textual imagination and code gen-\neration (method ①in Figure 1).\n• Diffusion+GPT-4V2. We use a finetuned Stable Diffu-\nsion to generate images as imagination and use GPT-4V\nas the controller to generate codes based on the visual\nimagination (method ②in Figure 1).\n• Diffusion+BC. The finetuned Stable Diffusion is used as\nthe imaginator while the behavior-cloning controller is\nused to convert images into voxel blueprints and execute\nactions.(method ③in Figure 1).\n5.3. Evaluation Metrics\nBased on existing evaluation methods in open-ended learn-\ning [30] and content generation in Minecraft [40], we intro-\nduce a set of evaluation aspects, which are important criteria\nfor creative agents:\n• Correctness. Are the creations consistent with the lan-\nguage instruction?\n• Complexity.\nCan the agent create large and complex\nbuildings?\n2We use GPT-4V here to indicate the agent additionally takes an image\nimagination as input.\n4\nDiffusion+GPT-4V CoT+GPT-4\nDiffusion+BC\nVanilla GPT-4\n1000\n1100\n1200\n1300\n1400\n1500\n1600\nElo Rating\n1531.0\n1441.0\n1395.0\n1233.0\nElo Ratings of Different Agents\nVanilla GPT-4\nCoT+GPT-4\nDiffusion+GPT-4V\nDiffusion+BC\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\nAverage Score\n18.1\n21.2\n22.4\n19.8\n19.1\n21.1\n23.2\n17.8\nAverage Score of Different Agents\nGPT-4V\nHumans\nFigure 3.

Right:\nThe average overall score of each agent in all test tasks evaluated by GPT-4V and humans.\n• Quality. Do the creations have a good visual appearance\nfrom the perspective of aesthetics?\n• Functionality. Do the created buildings have the neces-\nsary functions and structures (such as windows and en-\ntrances)?\nTo quantitatively evaluate such metrics, recent work [7]\nrequires humans to perform evaluation, which however is\nlabor-intensive and may be susceptible to subject prefer-\nences. To tackle these issues, we leverage the strong ca-\npabilities of the recent VLMs in vision-language reasoning\nand vision question answering and propose two VLM-based\nevaluation methods.\nIn the first method, given a language instruction, we sam-\nple a pair of creation results from two methods and fill in a\ntemplate to ask the VLM which one is better overall based\non all evaluation metrics:\nYou are a critic with high aesthetic ability. I\nwill provide you a text instruction and two\nbuildings created by different agents\nfollowing this instruction in the game \"\nMinecraft\".\nPlease evaluate their overall performance\naccording to four aspects: $(\nEVALUATION_ASPECT 1˜4). Tell me which\nbuilding in the image is better (left or\nright).\nText: $(INSTRUCTION)\nImage of buildings: $(IMAGE1, IMAGE2)\nWe use the Elo Rating System [12] to measure the relative\nstrength of each agent.\nIn the second method, we fill in a template with the four\nevaluation metrics above to ask the VLM to directly score\nfor each building:\nYou are a critic with high aesthetic ability. I\nwill provide you a text instruction and a\ncreated building following this instruction\nin the game \"Minecraft\".\nAccording to four aspects: $(EVALUATION_ASPECT\n1˜4),\nplease evaluate the building with a score (out of\n10) on each aspect respectively, then give a\ntotal score.\nText: $(INSTRUCTION)\nImage of the building: $IMAGE\nTo verify the reliability of VLMs in evaluation, we also ask\nhumans to participate in both two evaluation methods and\ncompare the difference between VLM and human evalua-\ntions.\n5.4. Results and Analysis\nIn the first evaluation method, every two agents are com-\npared by GPT-4V for each test task. With all these com-\nparison results, we model the four agents into a four-player\nzero-sum game and apply the Elo Rating System to com-\npute the ratings, as shown in Figure 3 (left).\nAccording to the second evaluation method, we record\nratings of each single test over the four metrics (correctness,\ncomplexity, quality, and functionality), the sum of which is\nthe overall score. We calculate the standard deviation of the\noverall scores of all test tasks for each agent, which repre-\nsents Robustness, with a larger standard deviation standing\nfor weaker robustness. To align with the other four metrics\nfor better presentation, we properly transform the standard\ndeviation into a value such that a higher value indicates bet-\nter robustness. Note that better robustness does not neces-\nsarily mean better performance since it merely indicates the\nconsistency of the performance on all test tasks. The results\nare plotted as a polar chart shown in Figure 2. Furthermore,\nthe overall score averaged over all test tasks for each agent\nis shown in Figure 3 (right). Figure 4 shows examples of\nthe language description, the generated visual imagination,\nand the created building of each agent.\nAnalyzing the experimental results, we can draw the fol-\nlowing primal conclusions:\n• CoT for textual imagination can effectively enrich the\ndetailed features of the target buildings.\n5\nComparing CoT+GPT-4 with Vanilla GPT-4, the for-\nmer outperforms the latter in terms of all metrics ex-\ncept robustness in the polar chart by a large margin, and\nCoT+GPT-4 obtains a higher score in the Elo Rating re-\nsults than Vanilla GPT-4. We assign this due to the rich\ninformation brought by Chain-of-Thought, which plays a\nrole in self-reflection. Through this process, the LLM gets\na better understanding of the details of the task, including\nbut not limited to the materials used, the size of the build-\ning, the significant features, etc. Within the context of a\nconversation, when GPT-4 generates the code in the sec-\nond round, it can still perceive the extra information from\nthe first round, thus reaching a better representation of the\ntask goal.\n• For the controller, using VLM instead of LLM leads\nto a marginally better performance in most metrics.\nAs shown in Figure 2, Diffusion+GPT-4V weakly sur-\npasses CoT+GPT-4 in correctness, complexity, quality,\nand robustness. However, Diffusion+GPT-4V strikes a tie\nwith CoT+GPT-4 in functionality. In terms of functional-\nity, Diffusion+GPT-4V behaves no better than CoT+GPT-\n4, which can be owing to the weak ability of GPT-4V\nin 3D reconstruction. Empirically, the images passed to\nGPT-4V are usually a complete building generated by the\ndiffusion-based imaginator, without the sectional view to\nshow the internal structures. Therefore, sometimes GPT-\n4V tends to write code that leads to a solid house instead\nof a hollow one. According to the criteria of functionality,\nsolid houses can result in low ratings.\n• Diffsion+GPT-4V has the best performance overall,\nshowing a strong ability of anti-interference and ro-\nbustness.\nIn Figure 3, both the Elo Rating results and the average\nscore show that the three variants proposed in Figure 1\noutperform the baseline to varying degrees, among which\nDiffsion+GPT-4V ranks the first. Combining the previous\ntwo conclusions, Diffusion+GPT-4V has both the advan-\ntage in visual imagination and the strengths from CoT,\nthus having a better performance. Additionally, we are\nsurprised to find that Diffusion+GPT-4V overcomes the\nmisleading information of the diffusion-based imaginator.\nIn about half of the test tasks, the images generated by the\ndiffusion-based imaginator tend to have obvious noises in\nthe background to some extent. However, GPT-4V seems\nto have the ability of anti-interference, thus capturing the\nmajor essential factors of the images. In contrast, Dif-\nfusion+BC may be susceptible to such noises, leading to\nweaker robustness.\n• The human-rating results coincide with the VLM-\nrating results with a minor gap, indicating that evalu-\nating by vision-language models is reliable.\nWe list the average scores by both VLM and human evalu-\nTable 1.

In both evaluations, the first two in the ranking\nare the same - Diffusion+GPT-4V and CoT+GPT-4. The\nlast two are in the opposite order but within a small gap.\nOverall, both two evaluations agree that Diffusion+GPT-\n4V has the best performance.\n• The buildings created by agents are relatively simple,\nlimited by the code written by language models and\nthe trained policy of the behavior-cloning controller.\nIn the analysis of the final creations of different agents,\nwe find that the buildings are relatively simple. For those\nvariants with GPT-4(V) controllers, this may be limited\nby the code written by GPT-4(V). Due to limited APIs\nin Mineflayer, GPT-4(V) tends to generate simple code.\nFor instance, GPT-4(V) tends to use for-loops in a piece\nof code that corresponds to a wall in the building, re-\nsulting in the square shape of the building.\nAddition-\nally, Mineflayer uses a rule-based algorithm for path plan-\nning to place blocks in the Minecraft world, and the agent\nwill always destroy some blocks when not able to find\na proper path toward the goal. Therefore, there can be\nmany demolished walls in the final creations.\nOn the\nother hand, the trained policy of the behavior-cloning\ncontroller has several limitations. When reconstructing\nvoxels from the images generated by the diffusion-based\nimaginator, the Pix2Vox approach can only capture the\nRGB color for each voxel and choose the most similar\nblock in Minecraft, which is not very accurate. To make\nthings worse, the plausible structure of a common build-\ning is missed out during the reconstruction, which makes\nthe voxel look like “a mess”. Some blocks are even float-\ning in the voxel, so they cannot be placed correctly in the\nfinal execution. This also provides a reason why Diffu-\nsion+BC ranks the last in the human evaluation results.\n5.5. The VLM Evaluator vs. Human Evaluators\nIn human evaluation, for the first evaluation method (1v1\ncomparison), we use the majority vote among all humans\n(49 human evaluators in total) to represent human prefer-\nence for each pair of buildings. For the second evaluation\nmethod, the scoring data from each human is standardized\nin each of the four evaluation metrics and the overall score.\n6\n“A huge Minecraft volcano built of ice.”\n“A tall Minecraft tower with glass windows, \nmainly built of leaves.”\n“A big Minecraft house built of colorful \nwools.”\n“A slender Minecraft tower with crystal-\nclear windows, predominantly crafted from \nbirch logs.”\n“A yellow concrete Minecraft house with a \nroof and windows.”\n“A sandstone palace in Minecraft with \nintricate details and towering minarets.”\n“A mystical ice castle in Minecraft, sculpted \nfrom packed ice and frosted blocks, adorned \nwith icicle chandeliers and frosty spires.”\n“A medieval-inspired fortress in Minecraft \nbuilt from cobblestone and mossy stone \nbricks, complete with imposing towers and a \ndrawbridge.”\nDiffusion Image\nVanilla GPT-4\nCoT+GPT-4\nDiffusion+GPT-4V\nDiffusion+BC\nText Description\n“An enchanting Minecraft pagoda adorned \nwith bamboo and built primarily of jungle \nwood planks.”\n“A pyramid in Minecraft built of sandstone.”\nFigure 4. Examples of the language description, the generated visual imagination, and the created building of each variant of creative\nagents. Visual imagination generated by the diffusion model has great diversity, which is an important manifestation of creativity.\nThen we take the average score from all humans as the\nhuman evaluation score for each building created by each\nagent. To measure the consistency of human and VLM eval-\nuators, we use “agreement”, which refers to the proportion\nof cases where the pairwise comparison between four vari-\nants of creative agents has the same numerical relationship\nin both human and VLM evaluations under each evaluation\nmetric.\nThe agreements of human and VLM evaluations are\nlisted in Table 1.\nThe agreement in the overall score is\n67%, greater than two-thirds, indicating that the VLM eval-\nuation is consistent with human evaluation to some extent,\nthough each metric may have a slightly different agreement.\nMoreover, the agreement in 1v1 is 62.5%, relatively lower\nthan that in the overall score, but they are reasonably consis-\ntent. Together with human and VLM evaluations reaching a\nconsensus that Diffusion+GPT-4V has the best performance\nfollowed by CoT+GPT-4, as shown in Figure 3 (right), we\nbelieve the VLM evaluator can be a good choice for creative\ntasks.\n7\n6. Related Work\n6.1. Open-Ended Agents\nIn recent years, task learning in open-ended worlds has at-\ntracted increasing attention, among which Minecraft [25]\nhas become a marvelous test-bed for open-ended learn-\ning. MineRL [18] and MineDojo [13] implemented sim-\nulated environments and organized datasets of a relatively\nlarge scale, and the latter provides tasks for agent train-\ning in the open-ended domain.\nHowever, most previous\nwork [3, 29, 45, 52] mainly focused on unlocking numerous\nskills and tackling long-horizon tasks in Minecraft, which\nhowever are mostly predefined, lacking the open-ended na-\nture, not to mention creativity.\nThe IGLU Competition [27] was a giant leap to solving\ntasks according to instructions in natural language. Skryn-\nnik et al. [41] proposed a pipeline containing a T5-based\nlanguage module, a rule-based transfer module, and the\ndownstream policy module for execution. This agent could\nsolve simple tasks of stacking blocks in Gridworld [53], a\nMinecraft-like open-ended world. However, it depended on\ntoo many step-by-step instructions, thus showing little cre-\nativity. In general, there is a significant gap between previ-\nous work and the true “creative agents”.\n6.2. Generative Models\nIn recent years, many modern generative models have been\nproposed and are used to produce high-quality samples in\nvarious domains [8]. Text-generative models have aroused\nmuch attention due to their wide range of uses. Especially,\nlarge language models (LLMs) are playing more and more\nsignificant roles in decision-making, planning, and reason-\ning.\nAmong LLMs, a representative one is GPT-4 [34],\nwhose emergence has laid a solid foundation for further re-\nsearch. Accompanied by the appearance of LLMs, prompt\nengineering and tuning techniques [5, 48] have been widely\nstudied and applied, including Parameter-Efficient Fine-\nTuning (PEFT) [21] and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [47]. In\nour work, LLMs with CoT are adopted as textual imagina-\ntors, and we also construct the text-based controller with\nLLM code generation.\nIn the field of computer vision, image-generative mod-\nels are becoming increasingly important.\nProminent ap-\nproaches include variational autoencoders (VAEs) [26],\nGenerative\nAdversarial\nNetworks\n(GANs)\n[15],\nand\nflows [22], demonstrating success in capturing image dis-\ntributions and representations. Recently, diffusion models\n[23] and DALL-E 3 [33] are springing up, accelerating the\nresearch in visual generation. In our work, a finetuned Sta-\nble Diffusion [38] is used for visual imagination, represent-\ning a concrete description of the building-creation task.\nIn the Minecraft world, previous work [2, 17, 40] fo-\ncuses on Procedural Content Generation (PCG). However,\nthey usually generate a pre-defined type of buildings with\na lot of human prior knowledge. In our work, imagination\nfor creative agents is similar to content generation, but our\nimaginator can generate with free-form instructions, in dif-\nferent modalities, and requiring much less human prior.\n6.3. Evaluation for Open-Ended Tasks\nRecent work has gathered many evaluation methods for\nopen-ended tasks. Voyager [44], STEVE-1 [29], and DIP-\nRL [32] use travel distance and collected items as surro-\ngate metrics to evaluate. GROOT [7] and BASALT compe-\ntition [31] use human evaluation, which is relatively labor-\nintensive and may be susceptible to subject preferences. Re-\ncent work [10, 13] proposes to use the CLIP-like model to\ncompute alignment between the behaviors and instructions.\nWe propose a novel evaluation method using VLMs, which\ncan either directly rate the performance in various aspects\nor conduct pairwise comparisons.\nIn terms of evaluation aspects, previous studies have pro-\nposed a variety of metrics. MCU [30] took evaluations from\nthe perspective of planning complexity, time consumption,\nnovelty, and creativity. GDMC Competition [40] required\nhumans as judges, rating the generated contents from adapt-\nability, functionality, evocative narrative, as well as visual\naesthetics. Team et al. [43] evaluated the results in both task\ncoverage and relative performance. Inspired by these stud-\nies, we adopt the evaluation aspects in correctness, com-\nplexity, quality, functionality, and robustness.\n7. Conclusion and Limitations\nIn this paper, we propose creative agents, which is the first\nframework that can handle creative tasks in an open-ended\nworld. Using this framework, we implement various em-\nbodied agents through different combinations of imagina-\ntors and controllers. Additionally, we tap into the potential\nof Vision-Language Models (VLMs), utilizing VLMs for\nevaluation as judges. By comparing the rating results from\nVLM and humans, we illustrate the reliability of VLM eval-\nuation.\nIn the meanwhile, we find a few limitations of these cre-\native agents, to be investigated in further work. First, there\nis much room for improving the BC controller, especially\nfor the performance of Pix2Vox module. Another limitation\nlies in the simplicity of the building created by the agents,\nwhich means the capabilities of these agents are limited.\nHow to enhance the creativity of agents can be a challeng-\ning problem.\nIn the end, we declare that creative agents is an initial\nattempt in this field, aimed at raising the awareness of build-\ning intelligent agents with creativity. We hope this work can\nbe of inspiration for further research.\n8\n```\n\n#### 5. 学生问题\n问题1：介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」\n问题2：这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？\n问题3：这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？\n\n\n请输出论文总结\n### 输出格式（输出语言用中文）\n```\n## 💡 解答问题1 (...复述学生问题1...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (...复述学生问题2...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (...复述学生问题3...)\n...\n```\n","llm_summary_res":"## 🌟 论文解读 | 创意智能体：赋予智能体想象力以完成创意任务\n\n## 📌 背景痛点\/本文动机\n现有的智能体大多只能执行预定义的任务，缺乏处理开放性任务的能力，尤其是那些需要创造力的任务。例如，在Minecraft游戏中，现有的智能体可以执行简单的指令，如“收集石头”或“建造一个雪人”，但无法完成更复杂的创意任务，如“建造一个砂岩宫殿”。这是因为它们无法将抽象的语言指令转换为具体的任务目标，并执行长期规划。\n\n## 🚀 核心方法\n本文提出了“创意智能体”的概念，通过赋予智能体想象力来处理开放性创意任务。创意智能体由两个主要部分组成：想象器和控制器。\n\n💡 创新点1：想象器\n想象器负责根据语言指令生成任务结果的详细想象。本文提出了两种实现想象器的方法：\n- **文本想象**：使用大型语言模型（LLM）如GPT-4，通过Chain-of-Thought（CoT）技术生成文本想象。\n- **视觉想象**：使用扩散模型如Stable Diffusion，生成与文本描述相符的视觉想象。\n\n💡 创新点2：控制器\n控制器负责将想象转换为可执行的计划。本文提出了两种实现控制器的方法：\n- **行为克隆控制器**：从环境中学习行为克隆策略，将图像想象转换为建筑蓝图，并执行相应的动作。\n- **基于GPT-4(V)的控制器**：利用GPT-4(V)的视觉语言理解和代码生成能力，直接生成可执行代码来完成任务。\n\n## 📈 实验结果\n本文在Minecraft游戏中进行了实验，结果表明，创意智能体能够根据自由形式的语言指令创建多样化和视觉上吸引人的建筑。其中，使用扩散模型进行视觉想象，并结合GPT-4(V)进行控制的智能体表现最佳。\n\n## 💬 可借鉴之处\n本文提出的创意智能体框架为开放性学习和创意AI智能体研究提供了新的思路和方法。未来可以进一步探索如何提高行为克隆控制器的性能，以及如何增强智能体的创造力。","llm_summary_res_status":200,"order":14,"query_answer":"## 💡 解答问题1 (介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」)\n\n这篇论文提出的benchmark是Minecraft游戏中的建筑创建任务。在这个benchmark中，智能体需要根据自由形式的语言指令创建多样化和视觉上吸引人的建筑。论文中使用了20个不同的语言指令来测试智能体的创造力，例如“建造一个砂岩宫殿”或“建造一个冰制的巨大火山”。\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？)\n\n论文中没有明确说明这个benchmark需要什么设备条件。但是，由于Minecraft是一个图形密集型的游戏，因此运行这个benchmark可能需要一台性能较好的计算机。此外，由于论文中使用了大型语言模型和扩散模型，因此训练和推理这些模型可能需要大量的计算资源，例如GPU和内存。\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？)\n\n这个benchmark的环境没有提供结果奖励或过程奖励。因此，RL类模型在这个benchmark上可能难以大放异彩。这是因为RL类模型通常需要明确的奖励信号来学习如何完成任务。","query_answer_status":200}

From sandbox games such as Smallville [40] to virtual environments [4, 32, 18],\nresearchers and practitioners have been building open-world simulators that can carry multi-agent\nbehaviors and navigate complex human relationships for decades. Especially with the advent of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), numerous multi-agent\nsimulators based on these technologies have been at the forefront in various fields, from fundamental\nresearch to practical applications, such as watch-and-help (WAH) task [65], Smallville [40] and\nOvercook games [18]. However, conventional multi-agent open-world simulators, valuable for\nexploring collective behavior, suffer from limitations (detailed comparison in Table 1). Firstly, they\nstruggle with large-scale scenarios due to the enormous resource consumption required for large-\nscale agents. Secondly, they are often under the assumption of perfect information and limitless\ncapabilities. These idealized worlds diverge sharply from the messy reality of human interaction.\n∗Equal contribution. The order of authors was determined randomly.\nBCorresponding author.\nPreprint. Under review.\narXiv:2403.19267v2  [cs.CL]  23 May 2024\nFigure 1: A panoramic view of one scene in MineLand, consisting of multiple AI agents. Subfigure\n3&6 show interactions demonstrating cooperation and competition among several agents. Subfigure\n5&2&4 showcases the scenarios where the limited senses, physical needs, and multitasking mecha-\nnism reflect. In Subfigure 1, an agent is performing a creative task named Exploration. Two agents in\nthe left cave of Subfigure 5 cooperate to finish a programmatic mining task, while agents in Subfigure\n3 are carrying out building construction, which is a hybrid task.\nThis gap between existing simulators and the real world hinders the ecological validity and richness\nof social interaction [21].\nTo bridge this gap, we propose MineLand (Section 2), a multi-agent Minecraft simulator, as shown\nin Figure 1, by introducing three key features: large-scale scalability, limited multimodal senses,\nand physical needs. First and foremost, the essence of the MineLand’s features is the ability to\nhandle the maximum number of agents. Compared to two-agent WAH, single-agent MineDojo [16]\nand twenty-five-agent Smallville [40], our MineLand enables the utilization of sixty-four or even\nmore agents on the mainstream consumer desktop PC. Secondly, our simulator operates under the\nhuman-like assumption [21] that agents possess only limited multimodal senses: partially observable\nenvironments, eco-centric perspective, and limited visual and auditory senses. This mirrors real-\nlife social interactions, where visibility and audibility can be affected by factors such as distance,\nterrain, and environment. These limitations restrict information access, forcing agents to actively\ncommunicate to compensate for sensory deficiencies. Thirdly, we integrate realistic physical needs\ninto agents. Agents require fundamental physical needs, such as food, sustenance, and resource\nmanagement, which adds a time-based aspect to their daily routine procedures. This necessitates\ncollaboration and competition for resources, mirroring the complex interplay of cooperation and\nself-interest observed in human societies [15, 1]. By incorporating these three features, our simulator\nfosters the emergence of dynamic and ecologically valid multi-agent interactions1.\nAs an open-world multi-agent simulator, MineLand is an excellent platform for benchmarking multi-\nagent capabilities (Section 3), hence we crowd-sourced datasets to fully evaluate the potential of\nLLM- or VLM-based multi-agents. For previously existing tasks, programmatic tasks (e.g., harvest,\ntech tree, combat tasks) and creative tasks (e.g., survival tasks), we offer a significantly expanded task\nquantity. Specifically, we crowd-sourced 4499 programmatic tasks and 1536 creative tasks, which\nis 2 times compared to MineDojo. Interestingly, we introduce a novel “hybrid task” category that\ncombines the features of programmatic tasks and creative tasks. Construction and Stage Performance\ntasks exemplify this new category, bringing the total to 18 hybrid tasks. Additionally, the simulator\n1Ecological validity refers to interactions between agents within a simulated environment that closely\nresemble real-world human interactions. For example, actions are situated, adaptive, and environmentally\nconstrained.\n2\nTable 1: Part of the comparison with related popular platforms or projects.

Alex allows for simultaneously executing intricate coordination\nand scheduling with multiple tasks. With this AI agent framework, we have obtained the following\nintriguing findings: (1) Our simulator shows the feature of large-scale scalability (supporting 64\nagents, x8 times than before, (§5.1), limited multimodal senses (§J) and physical needs (§K). By\nincorporating these three features, our simulator fosters social dynamics (§5.2&§O). (2) Our bench-\nmark and datasets are challenging (§5.3&§5.4). (3) Our agents work together more effectively, with a\nreduced workload per agent (§5.5), and the multitasking mechanism for agents is beneficial (§5.6).\nIn summary, our contributions are three-fold: the simulator, benchmark, and AI agent. With these\ncontributions, we push the boundaries of multi-agent simulation by bridging the gap between virtual\nagents and large-scale real-world humans. This not only advances understanding of AI multi-agents\nbut also holds potential for applications in human dynamics, social psychology, robotics, and game\ndesign. We anticipate that this work will serve as a useful foundation for the community to create\nnew algorithms and make progress in the field of embodied AI multi-agent systems.\n2\nMineLand Simulator\nConventional multi-agent open-world simulators suffer from the gap between virtual agents and\nlarge-scale real-world humans. To bring this gap, we propose MineLand with three key features:\nlarge-scale scalability, limited multimodal senses, and physical needs. This section describes the\ndesign and implementation of this simulator, focusing on the architecture, observation space, state\nspace, action space and communication. During introducing the design, we will highlight techniques\nthat bring the three key features and omit the parts similar to other Minecraft simulators.\n2.1\nArchitecture\nMineLand, inspired by Malmo [27], Mineflayer [43], MineDojo [16] and Voyager [57], is a Minecraft\nsimulator where players2 can explore, and interact with each other as well as the environments. The\narchitecture as shown in Figure 2 consists of three main modules (Details in Section C.1): the Bot\nModule, the Environment Module, and the Bridge Module.\nWhat technology has caused the feature of large-scale scalability?\nExisting Minecraft simulators\n(e.g., Malmo, MineRL, MineDojo) necessitate running a Minecraft game client for each player. This\nclient-based approach comes with a notable drawback - it incurs substantial resource costs and\n2In this work, we use the term “player” to refer to both human players and AI agents. When we mention\n“agent”, we specifically mean AI agents. Humans have the option to access the game either through VR or using\na keyboard.\n3\nFigure 2: Illustration of the architecture of MineLand.\nmost machines cannot handle running large-scale Minecraft game clients concurrently. In contrast,\nMineLand adopts a different approach. It simplifies each Minecraft client into a single thread,\noptimizing performance overhead caused by multiple clients. With MineLand, adding one more\nagent only requires one more thread. Based on this new technique, MineLand supports 64 or more\nagents on a mainstream consumer desktop PC, which is a substantial improvement compared to other\nMinecraft platforms that can only support up to 2 agents. We conducted relevant experiments in\nSection 5.1.\n2.2\nObservation Space\nThe observation space is designed to be compatible with almost all APIs of the popular MineDojo\nframework. MineLand provides sensor information for players: tactile information (information\nabout the blocks surrounding the agent, which represent the objects that the agent can touch), auditory\ninformation, and visual information (RGB video from the first-person perspective of the agent). These\nthree modalities (namely, touch, vision, and hearing) together provide the agents with multimodal\nsenses. Note that this information is all raw perceptual information.3\nWhat technology has caused the feature of limited multimodal senses?\nWe refer to the mech-\nanisms of human vision and hearing, and impose limitations on the sensor perception of players,\nincluding distance attenuation, environmental obstructions, and directional constraints, to model the\nlimited senses.\n2.3\nState Space\nPrevious simulators focus on task-oriented activities, thus the state space focuses on the inventory\nand equipment. We use a state space that blends task-oriented activities with the rhythms of daily life.\nWhat technology has caused the feature of physical needs?\nBasic physical needs are the foun-\ndation that leads to daily life behavior. For the rhythms of daily life, we define the states of agents\nfor themselves: physical needs like oxygen and hunger. Blending the rhythms of daily life with\ntask-oriented activities is what makes this simulator stand out. Imagine agents waking up in their\nvirtual Minecraft homes, engaging in daily routines like cooking to satisfy physical food needs, but\nalso having defined jobs (e.g., lumberjack, farmer) that involve specific task-oriented activities. This\ncreates a natural flow between daily life and goal-driven behavior, providing a more realistic and\nnuanced environment for studying agent interactions and complex social dynamics.\n2.4\nAction Space\nThe simulator offers a unique action space encompassing both low-level and high-level actions.\nFor the low-level actions, MineLand includes basic actions like walking, running, jumping, and\ninteracting with objects. The low-level actions are the same as the traditional action space in gym-\nstyle API. We also support Reinforcement Learning based on low-level actions (For more details\nabout experiments of Reinforcement Learning method, please refer to Section I. High-level actions,\n3Besides the raw perceptual information, MineLand also provides the events encountered by the agent, such\nas injury, death, and others. Injury events can also be regarded as tactile information, but they are presented in\nthe form of events for simplicity.\n4\nFigure 3: Illustration of Tasks. We have expanded the number of programmatic tasks and creative\ntasks by 2 times, compared to MineDojo. Additionally, we have introduced novel hybrid tasks that\ncombine the features of programmatic tasks and creative tasks. Customizing the number of players is\nsupported. For multi-agents, we provide two modes: cooperative mode and competitive mode.\nlike dodging obstacles and manipulating tools, are suitable for complex tasks that consist of several\nlow-level actions and require longer computation times. The high-level actions are implemented in\nthe form of code, following Voyager [57]. Imagine agents navigating the world, dodging obstacles,\nand manipulating tools. These complex tasks generate an action sequence, allowing the simulator to\ncontinue executing the low-level actions, skip some steps earlier, or be interrupted by some special\nevent.\n2.5\nCommunication\nDiversity\nDiverse communication strategies can lead to the emergence of more realistic behaviors\nwithin the simulated environment. We design three communication strategies including auditory\ninformation, body language (via visual perception), and sharing information in text media.\nWhat communication technology has caused the feature of large-scale scalability?\nFor multi-\nagent simulators, an efficient communication mechanism is crucial, especially in situations with\nlarge-scale scalability. Traditional communication methods, like centralized broadcasting to all\nagents, can become computationally expensive and slow down the simulation with a large number of\nagents. Here we design a distance-constrained constrained communication mechanism. If an agent\nwants to communicate with other agents, it chats through Minecraft’s message bar. Only when the\ndistance between other agents and the sending agent is less than a certain threshold, will other agents\nreceive messages. Similarly, communications via auditory information and body language are limited\nby distance.\nHow is the interrupt mechanism implemented?\nMost importantly, the new message is allowed to\ninterrupt the executing code and execute this message directly before the previous code has ended.\nWe term this as the interrupt mechanism. With this mechanism, even if an agent is working on a\n5-minute extension (such as mining), it is still feasible for other agents to communicate with this\nworking agent at any time. This interrupt mechanism was not supported in the previous work, such as\nVoyager [57]. Next, we will introduce how to implement it. For a high-level action, the execution\nof the code is divided into several steps, with each step lasting 50-200 milliseconds4. Before taking\na step, the agent is provided with the running states of the previous code, either running, ready, or\nexceptions. After completing a step, the agent, based on the running states, can choose to either\nswitch to a new action code or continue executing the previous code. This function of choosing is\nimplemented by an automatic gate control system with two gates: New and Resume. New means the\nagent wants to switch to a new code in the following steps. Resume indicates that the agent wants to\ncontinue executing the previous code. In this way, the agent can complete a code that needs to be\nexecuted for a long period, or be interrupted at an appropriate time. You may refer Section E.4 for an\nexample.\n450 milliseconds is the minimum time unit in Minecraft. We refer to this minimum time unit as a “tick”.\n5\n3\nMineLand Benchmark Suite and Dataset\nMineLand, as a large-scale multi-agent simulator, push the boundaries of multi-agent capabilities by\nenabling them to tackle complex human-like planning tasks within diverse environments. However,\nevaluating these advanced planning abilities necessitates sophisticated benchmarks. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a new benchmark suit, MineLand benchmark. MineLand benchmark\nsurpasses existing benchmarks by offering significantly more tasks (doubling programmatic and\ncreative tasks compared to MineDojo) and introducing a novel “hybrid task” category that combines\nthe features of programmatic and creative tasks (including Construction Tasks and Stage Performance\nTasks). Additionally, this benchmark allows for flexible player numbers and exploration through\ncooperative and competitive modes. Competitive mode can be used to measure the differences in\ncapabilities between different AI agents, as well as to develop adversarial learning algorithms. Refer\nto Section D for more details.\n3.1\nProgrammatic Task\nWe follow MineDojo [16] for the design of programmatic tasks. Each Task T is defined as a 5-tuple:\nT = (G, G, I, fsuc, S). G refers to the task goal that needs to be completed. G is guidance. I is\nthe initial condition of the task. fsuc is the Success Criterion. S is a set of parameters that could be\ncustomized. Different from MineDojo, these parameters include the number of agents, cooperative\nmode, competitive mode, etc. In total, MineLand has 4499 programmatic tasks.\n3.2\nCreative Task\nCreative tasks is defined by a 4-tuple: T = (G, G, I, S). There are 1536 creative tasks in total, and is\ncompatible with tasks in MineDojo.\n3.3\nHybrid Task\nHybrid tasks do not have a unique ground truth but have several references5. We represent the hybrid\ntask as T = (G, G, I, D, fscore, S). where D denotes the references. Unlike programmatic tasks,\nbecause Hybrid tasks do not have a ground truth, MineLand will return a score of fscore based on D.\nThe higher the score, the better the task is completed. We design two types of tasks: Construction\nand Stage Performance, for hybrid tasks.\nConstruction Tasks Given a blueprint for a building or scene, the Construction Task aims to\nbuild these buildings or scenes based on the blueprint. The blueprint, either pictures in real life or\nMinecraft-style pictures, is the reference D.\nEvaluation Metrics. MineLand gives a score based on whether the constructed buildings meet the\nblueprint’s expectations. We calculate the task scores through the VLM-based evaluations and human\nevaluation, which both use the same criteria (refer to Section Q for more details). The evaluation\nscores range from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating that the agents’ constructions more closely\nresemble the intended blueprint.\nStage Performance Tasks Given a script of a drama consisting of several behaviors, which may be a\nsingle action or an emotional expression, the Stage Performance Task aims to perform the script with\nagents as actors.\nEvaluation Metrics. We leverage two complementary evaluation metrics: an LCS (Longest Common\nSubsequence)-based metric and human evaluation. The LCS-based metric consists of two distinct\nscores: the keypoint score and the appropriateness score. We present the formulas for adding up these\ntwo scores:\nfkey + fappro = |LCS(SEQAgent, SEQ∗)|\n|SEQ∗|\n+ |LCS(SEQAgent, SEQ∗)|\n|SEQAgent|\n(1)\nwhere SEQAgent represents the action sequence generated by the agent, while SEQ∗is the ground\ntruth. LCS(A, B) denotes the LCS between A and B. |A| is the length of sequence A. The\n5Hybrid tasks resemble translation tasks in that, while a single unique translation may not exist, multiple\nreference translations can guide the process. Here references could be key rules, constraints, and key evaluation\nindicators, etc.\n6\nkeypoint score emphasizes the completeness of the enacted behaviors, ensuring all crucial actions\nand expressions are performed. The appropriateness score goes beyond completeness to evaluate\nthe overall coherence and naturalness of the performance, considering how well the behaviors flow\ntogether and align with the script’s dramatic intent. The human evaluation score is an integer between\n1 and 5, with higher scores indicating better performance. It provides a comprehensive assessment\nof the agents’ ability to not only execute actions accurately but also to deliver them naturally and\nengagingly. Details of the human evaluation criteria can be found in Section R.\nFigure 4: Illustration of the architecture of Alex.\n4\nAlex Agent\nTo truly demonstrate the challenge of this benchmark, we propose Alex6, a VLM-based agent\nas shown in Figure 4. Conventional LLM-powered AI agents depend on LLM to operate as its\nbrain, which is backed by several vital components that perform various essential functions. These\ncomponents, such as the memory component, planning component, and acting component, have been\nthoroughly studied recently. To cater to our specific requirements, we have improved these three\ncomponents (refer to Section E for more details), replaced LLM with VLM and introduced one new\ncomponent: the multitasking component. Additionally, Alex exhibits different personality traits\npredefined in the system prompt.\nMultitasking Component\nPeople often switch attention between tasks, for example cooking while\ntalking. The ability to communicate smoothly with other players while working on a task-oriented\naction is crucial in multi-agent scenarios. Therefore, we develop the mechanism of multitasking ability\nto enhance the agent’s attention control and working memory abilities inspired by the Multitasking\ntheory from the Cognition field [53]. Specifically, for attention control, the interrupt mechanism\neffectively controls attention among multiple tasks. For working memory, Alex maintains and\nprocesses information in the Memory Library. When another agent says hello to the working agent,\nthis involves saving and restoring internal states when frequent and high-speed switching between\ncommunication activities and goal-driven working actions to avoid forgetting ongoing tasks. With\nthe multitasking mechanism, Alex allows for simultaneously simulating and executing intricate\ncoordination and scheduling with multiple tasks.\n5\nExperiments\n5.1\nExperiments of Simulators Performance\nWe evaluate the number of agents that MineLand can support and compare MineLand with other\npopular Minecraft simulators. We utilize a mainstream consumer desktop PC equipped with an\nIntel i5-12400F CPU and 64GB of memory. Performance Monitor is employed to monitor the\nprocess. Our findings reveal that MineLand is capable of supporting 32 agents simultaneously while\n6Alex is the protagonist in the sandbox game Minecraft, one of the default skins for players and a character in\nthe game: https:\/\/www.minecraft.net\/zh-hans. To pay tribute, we named our proposed AI agent Alex.\n7\nproviding visual displays. When visual display is disabled, the number of concurrently running agents\nincreases to ×4 times. Furthermore, as depicted in Table 2, when MineLand and Malmo both run\n8 agents, MineLand’s CPU and memory usage are approximately 1\/3 that of Malmo’s (specifically,\n35.6% and 38.0%, respectively). It is worth noting that Malmo serves as the foundation for most\npopular Minecraft Platforms (e.g., MineDojo\/MineRL\/MarLÖ [42]), thus highlighting MineLand’s\nsuperior performance compared to the vast majority of existing Minecraft Platforms. Consequently,\nMineLand proves to be highly suitable for multi-agent environments.\n5.2\nExperiments of Social Dynamics\nIn the “unlocking tools” task with two agents (Table 3), two agents in the collaborative mode work\ntogether effectively, with a reduced workload per agent and higher communication expenses. On the\nother hand, two competitive agents worked independently and necessitated fewer code iterations. The\nprimary reason is that, in competitive relationships, agents tend to achieve more in a single iteration\nto expedite progress and outperform their opponents. However, this results in less thorough planning\nand more code errors. Consequently, multiple agents in competitive relationships require fewer code\niterations but make more mistakes.\nWe also observe that personality plays a significant role in determining the behavior of agents in\nmulti-agent societies [25]. We assigned the personality traits of high extraversion and agreeableness\nto both agents. Under this condition, the agents tended to establish collaboration and engage in\nmutual communication (co-op >8 out of 10 times). This result is consistent with human behavior [13].\nWhen no personality was set for the agents, they worked independently (co-op 0 out of 10 times). For\nmore experiments of simulating sociological phenomena with >10 agents, please refer to Section O.\nTable 2:\nPart of the comparison table of per-\nformance of Minecraft simulators.\nThe full ta-\nble is in Table 9.\nMineLandw\/o vision means\nMineLand without vision.

While Alex demonstrates a promising capability in selecting appropriate\nmaterials for both tasks, its overall construction abilities are currently limited. We posit two key\nreasons for these limitations: complex task planning and high-precision manipulation. For the\nfirst reason, construction tasks are inherently time-consuming and require sophisticated planning\nabilities. For instance, building auxiliary structures to facilitate the main construction process is\ncrucial for achieving significant height. However, Alex cannot currently plan and construct such\nauxiliary structures, hindering its ability to construct tall structures. The second reason is the high-\nprecision manipulation. The construction tasks necessitate high-precision manipulation, such as\nadding decorative details. Alex primarily utilizes high-level actions and lacks the necessary APIs to\nexecute these fine-grained manipulations effectively. These results show the challenge of this task.\n5.4\nExperiments of Stage Performance Tasks\nWe evaluate our un-finetuned Alex on four example stage performance tasks (Table 5). We found\nthat in single-agent tasks, the agent typically exhibits high scores across all three evaluation metrics.\nHowever, in multi-agent tasks, the keypoint score tends to be higher than the appropriate score\n8\nbecause the agent can understand the script and fulfill the key requirements. In contrast, the human\nevaluation scores are usually relatively lower because agents often engage in unnecessary dialogue in\nscripts that require collaboration, resulting in lower scores.\nTable 4: Human evaluation score\nand VLM-based (gpt-4o) evalua-\ntion score of Alex agent on two\nconstruction tasks.

We observed that agents in a cooperative relationship required more code\niterations to finish the task, primarily because most of these iterations were dedicated to establishing\nand maintaining communication, as well as task allocation. For example, when one agent says in a\nchat that he needs two sticks, another agent will ask for getting together near the table, and then give\nthe sticks to him. However, the actual workload for each agent is reduced without considering the\nchat cost. Compared to agents working independently, the code iteration cost of agents cooperating is\nreduced by 20% per agent.\n5.6\nExperiments of Multitasking\nTo validate the impact of multitasking support in the simulator7, we conduct the obsidian mining\ntask, which takes over 8 minutes and requires multiple steps to complete. In the beginning, the agent\nis mining and encounters chat or hurt events within 8 minutes. Chat event: Another agent nearby\ninitiates a conversation with Alex. This is a low-priority event, and Alex can choose whether to\nrespond to the agent nearby. Hurt event: The agent gets hurts. For example, a zombie attacks the\nagent. This is a high-priority event, requiring Alex to stop its current task and address this event first.\nWe expect the two types of events to activate the multitasking component and the agent processes the\nmining and the special event simultaneously. Results are in Table 6. In all ten runs, we count the\nnumber of successfully handling multitasks. For the hurt event, if the agent fights back due to this\nhurt event, it is considered successful. For the chat event, if the agent responds due to the chat event,\nit is considered successful. Results reveal that Alexw\/o mt can’t process events timely, resulting in\nAlex being killed by the zombie. In contrast, Alex with a multitasking component is capable of\nmanaging multiple events (e.g., mining while chatting), autonomously determining their priority, and\naddressing the higher-priority events first. Hence, multitasking is an essential mechanism.\nTable 6: Comparison between Alex and Alexw\/o mt (Alex without the multitasking component).\nAgent\nHurt event\nChat event\nAlex\n8\/10\n2\/10\nAlexw\/o mt\n0\/10\n0\/10\n7This multitasking functionality is achieved through the synergistic interplay of two keys: the multitasking\ncomponent in Alex and the interrupt mechanism in MineLand.\n9\n6\nConclusion\nTraditional multi-agent simulators struggle with large-scale scenarios and often assume perfect\ninformation and unrealistic agent capabilities.

From sandbox games such as Smallville [40] to virtual environments [4, 32, 18],\nresearchers and practitioners have been building open-world simulators that can carry multi-agent\nbehaviors and navigate complex human relationships for decades. Especially with the advent of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), numerous multi-agent\nsimulators based on these technologies have been at the forefront in various fields, from fundamental\nresearch to practical applications, such as watch-and-help (WAH) task [65], Smallville [40] and\nOvercook games [18]. However, conventional multi-agent open-world simulators, valuable for\nexploring collective behavior, suffer from limitations (detailed comparison in Table 1). Firstly, they\nstruggle with large-scale scenarios due to the enormous resource consumption required for large-\nscale agents. Secondly, they are often under the assumption of perfect information and limitless\ncapabilities. These idealized worlds diverge sharply from the messy reality of human interaction.\n∗Equal contribution. The order of authors was determined randomly.\nBCorresponding author.\nPreprint. Under review.\narXiv:2403.19267v2  [cs.CL]  23 May 2024\nFigure 1: A panoramic view of one scene in MineLand, consisting of multiple AI agents. Subfigure\n3&6 show interactions demonstrating cooperation and competition among several agents. Subfigure\n5&2&4 showcases the scenarios where the limited senses, physical needs, and multitasking mecha-\nnism reflect. In Subfigure 1, an agent is performing a creative task named Exploration. Two agents in\nthe left cave of Subfigure 5 cooperate to finish a programmatic mining task, while agents in Subfigure\n3 are carrying out building construction, which is a hybrid task.\nThis gap between existing simulators and the real world hinders the ecological validity and richness\nof social interaction [21].\nTo bridge this gap, we propose MineLand (Section 2), a multi-agent Minecraft simulator, as shown\nin Figure 1, by introducing three key features: large-scale scalability, limited multimodal senses,\nand physical needs. First and foremost, the essence of the MineLand’s features is the ability to\nhandle the maximum number of agents. Compared to two-agent WAH, single-agent MineDojo [16]\nand twenty-five-agent Smallville [40], our MineLand enables the utilization of sixty-four or even\nmore agents on the mainstream consumer desktop PC. Secondly, our simulator operates under the\nhuman-like assumption [21] that agents possess only limited multimodal senses: partially observable\nenvironments, eco-centric perspective, and limited visual and auditory senses. This mirrors real-\nlife social interactions, where visibility and audibility can be affected by factors such as distance,\nterrain, and environment. These limitations restrict information access, forcing agents to actively\ncommunicate to compensate for sensory deficiencies. Thirdly, we integrate realistic physical needs\ninto agents. Agents require fundamental physical needs, such as food, sustenance, and resource\nmanagement, which adds a time-based aspect to their daily routine procedures. This necessitates\ncollaboration and competition for resources, mirroring the complex interplay of cooperation and\nself-interest observed in human societies [15, 1]. By incorporating these three features, our simulator\nfosters the emergence of dynamic and ecologically valid multi-agent interactions1.\nAs an open-world multi-agent simulator, MineLand is an excellent platform for benchmarking multi-\nagent capabilities (Section 3), hence we crowd-sourced datasets to fully evaluate the potential of\nLLM- or VLM-based multi-agents. For previously existing tasks, programmatic tasks (e.g., harvest,\ntech tree, combat tasks) and creative tasks (e.g., survival tasks), we offer a significantly expanded task\nquantity. Specifically, we crowd-sourced 4499 programmatic tasks and 1536 creative tasks, which\nis 2 times compared to MineDojo. Interestingly, we introduce a novel “hybrid task” category that\ncombines the features of programmatic tasks and creative tasks. Construction and Stage Performance\ntasks exemplify this new category, bringing the total to 18 hybrid tasks. Additionally, the simulator\n1Ecological validity refers to interactions between agents within a simulated environment that closely\nresemble real-world human interactions. For example, actions are situated, adaptive, and environmentally\nconstrained.\n2\nTable 1: Part of the comparison with related popular platforms or projects.

Alex allows for simultaneously executing intricate coordination\nand scheduling with multiple tasks. With this AI agent framework, we have obtained the following\nintriguing findings: (1) Our simulator shows the feature of large-scale scalability (supporting 64\nagents, x8 times than before, (§5.1), limited multimodal senses (§J) and physical needs (§K). By\nincorporating these three features, our simulator fosters social dynamics (§5.2&§O). (2) Our bench-\nmark and datasets are challenging (§5.3&§5.4). (3) Our agents work together more effectively, with a\nreduced workload per agent (§5.5), and the multitasking mechanism for agents is beneficial (§5.6).\nIn summary, our contributions are three-fold: the simulator, benchmark, and AI agent. With these\ncontributions, we push the boundaries of multi-agent simulation by bridging the gap between virtual\nagents and large-scale real-world humans. This not only advances understanding of AI multi-agents\nbut also holds potential for applications in human dynamics, social psychology, robotics, and game\ndesign. We anticipate that this work will serve as a useful foundation for the community to create\nnew algorithms and make progress in the field of embodied AI multi-agent systems.\n2\nMineLand Simulator\nConventional multi-agent open-world simulators suffer from the gap between virtual agents and\nlarge-scale real-world humans. To bring this gap, we propose MineLand with three key features:\nlarge-scale scalability, limited multimodal senses, and physical needs. This section describes the\ndesign and implementation of this simulator, focusing on the architecture, observation space, state\nspace, action space and communication. During introducing the design, we will highlight techniques\nthat bring the three key features and omit the parts similar to other Minecraft simulators.\n2.1\nArchitecture\nMineLand, inspired by Malmo [27], Mineflayer [43], MineDojo [16] and Voyager [57], is a Minecraft\nsimulator where players2 can explore, and interact with each other as well as the environments. The\narchitecture as shown in Figure 2 consists of three main modules (Details in Section C.1): the Bot\nModule, the Environment Module, and the Bridge Module.\nWhat technology has caused the feature of large-scale scalability?\nExisting Minecraft simulators\n(e.g., Malmo, MineRL, MineDojo) necessitate running a Minecraft game client for each player. This\nclient-based approach comes with a notable drawback - it incurs substantial resource costs and\n2In this work, we use the term “player” to refer to both human players and AI agents. When we mention\n“agent”, we specifically mean AI agents. Humans have the option to access the game either through VR or using\na keyboard.\n3\nFigure 2: Illustration of the architecture of MineLand.\nmost machines cannot handle running large-scale Minecraft game clients concurrently. In contrast,\nMineLand adopts a different approach. It simplifies each Minecraft client into a single thread,\noptimizing performance overhead caused by multiple clients. With MineLand, adding one more\nagent only requires one more thread. Based on this new technique, MineLand supports 64 or more\nagents on a mainstream consumer desktop PC, which is a substantial improvement compared to other\nMinecraft platforms that can only support up to 2 agents. We conducted relevant experiments in\nSection 5.1.\n2.2\nObservation Space\nThe observation space is designed to be compatible with almost all APIs of the popular MineDojo\nframework. MineLand provides sensor information for players: tactile information (information\nabout the blocks surrounding the agent, which represent the objects that the agent can touch), auditory\ninformation, and visual information (RGB video from the first-person perspective of the agent). These\nthree modalities (namely, touch, vision, and hearing) together provide the agents with multimodal\nsenses. Note that this information is all raw perceptual information.3\nWhat technology has caused the feature of limited multimodal senses?\nWe refer to the mech-\nanisms of human vision and hearing, and impose limitations on the sensor perception of players,\nincluding distance attenuation, environmental obstructions, and directional constraints, to model the\nlimited senses.\n2.3\nState Space\nPrevious simulators focus on task-oriented activities, thus the state space focuses on the inventory\nand equipment. We use a state space that blends task-oriented activities with the rhythms of daily life.\nWhat technology has caused the feature of physical needs?\nBasic physical needs are the foun-\ndation that leads to daily life behavior. For the rhythms of daily life, we define the states of agents\nfor themselves: physical needs like oxygen and hunger. Blending the rhythms of daily life with\ntask-oriented activities is what makes this simulator stand out. Imagine agents waking up in their\nvirtual Minecraft homes, engaging in daily routines like cooking to satisfy physical food needs, but\nalso having defined jobs (e.g., lumberjack, farmer) that involve specific task-oriented activities. This\ncreates a natural flow between daily life and goal-driven behavior, providing a more realistic and\nnuanced environment for studying agent interactions and complex social dynamics.\n2.4\nAction Space\nThe simulator offers a unique action space encompassing both low-level and high-level actions.\nFor the low-level actions, MineLand includes basic actions like walking, running, jumping, and\ninteracting with objects. The low-level actions are the same as the traditional action space in gym-\nstyle API. We also support Reinforcement Learning based on low-level actions (For more details\nabout experiments of Reinforcement Learning method, please refer to Section I. High-level actions,\n3Besides the raw perceptual information, MineLand also provides the events encountered by the agent, such\nas injury, death, and others. Injury events can also be regarded as tactile information, but they are presented in\nthe form of events for simplicity.\n4\nFigure 3: Illustration of Tasks. We have expanded the number of programmatic tasks and creative\ntasks by 2 times, compared to MineDojo. Additionally, we have introduced novel hybrid tasks that\ncombine the features of programmatic tasks and creative tasks. Customizing the number of players is\nsupported. For multi-agents, we provide two modes: cooperative mode and competitive mode.\nlike dodging obstacles and manipulating tools, are suitable for complex tasks that consist of several\nlow-level actions and require longer computation times. The high-level actions are implemented in\nthe form of code, following Voyager [57]. Imagine agents navigating the world, dodging obstacles,\nand manipulating tools. These complex tasks generate an action sequence, allowing the simulator to\ncontinue executing the low-level actions, skip some steps earlier, or be interrupted by some special\nevent.\n2.5\nCommunication\nDiversity\nDiverse communication strategies can lead to the emergence of more realistic behaviors\nwithin the simulated environment. We design three communication strategies including auditory\ninformation, body language (via visual perception), and sharing information in text media.\nWhat communication technology has caused the feature of large-scale scalability?\nFor multi-\nagent simulators, an efficient communication mechanism is crucial, especially in situations with\nlarge-scale scalability. Traditional communication methods, like centralized broadcasting to all\nagents, can become computationally expensive and slow down the simulation with a large number of\nagents. Here we design a distance-constrained constrained communication mechanism. If an agent\nwants to communicate with other agents, it chats through Minecraft’s message bar. Only when the\ndistance between other agents and the sending agent is less than a certain threshold, will other agents\nreceive messages. Similarly, communications via auditory information and body language are limited\nby distance.\nHow is the interrupt mechanism implemented?\nMost importantly, the new message is allowed to\ninterrupt the executing code and execute this message directly before the previous code has ended.\nWe term this as the interrupt mechanism. With this mechanism, even if an agent is working on a\n5-minute extension (such as mining), it is still feasible for other agents to communicate with this\nworking agent at any time. This interrupt mechanism was not supported in the previous work, such as\nVoyager [57]. Next, we will introduce how to implement it. For a high-level action, the execution\nof the code is divided into several steps, with each step lasting 50-200 milliseconds4. Before taking\na step, the agent is provided with the running states of the previous code, either running, ready, or\nexceptions. After completing a step, the agent, based on the running states, can choose to either\nswitch to a new action code or continue executing the previous code. This function of choosing is\nimplemented by an automatic gate control system with two gates: New and Resume. New means the\nagent wants to switch to a new code in the following steps. Resume indicates that the agent wants to\ncontinue executing the previous code. In this way, the agent can complete a code that needs to be\nexecuted for a long period, or be interrupted at an appropriate time. You may refer Section E.4 for an\nexample.\n450 milliseconds is the minimum time unit in Minecraft. We refer to this minimum time unit as a “tick”.\n5\n3\nMineLand Benchmark Suite and Dataset\nMineLand, as a large-scale multi-agent simulator, push the boundaries of multi-agent capabilities by\nenabling them to tackle complex human-like planning tasks within diverse environments. However,\nevaluating these advanced planning abilities necessitates sophisticated benchmarks. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a new benchmark suit, MineLand benchmark. MineLand benchmark\nsurpasses existing benchmarks by offering significantly more tasks (doubling programmatic and\ncreative tasks compared to MineDojo) and introducing a novel “hybrid task” category that combines\nthe features of programmatic and creative tasks (including Construction Tasks and Stage Performance\nTasks). Additionally, this benchmark allows for flexible player numbers and exploration through\ncooperative and competitive modes. Competitive mode can be used to measure the differences in\ncapabilities between different AI agents, as well as to develop adversarial learning algorithms. Refer\nto Section D for more details.\n3.1\nProgrammatic Task\nWe follow MineDojo [16] for the design of programmatic tasks. Each Task T is defined as a 5-tuple:\nT = (G, G, I, fsuc, S). G refers to the task goal that needs to be completed. G is guidance. I is\nthe initial condition of the task. fsuc is the Success Criterion. S is a set of parameters that could be\ncustomized. Different from MineDojo, these parameters include the number of agents, cooperative\nmode, competitive mode, etc. In total, MineLand has 4499 programmatic tasks.\n3.2\nCreative Task\nCreative tasks is defined by a 4-tuple: T = (G, G, I, S). There are 1536 creative tasks in total, and is\ncompatible with tasks in MineDojo.\n3.3\nHybrid Task\nHybrid tasks do not have a unique ground truth but have several references5. We represent the hybrid\ntask as T = (G, G, I, D, fscore, S). where D denotes the references. Unlike programmatic tasks,\nbecause Hybrid tasks do not have a ground truth, MineLand will return a score of fscore based on D.\nThe higher the score, the better the task is completed. We design two types of tasks: Construction\nand Stage Performance, for hybrid tasks.\nConstruction Tasks Given a blueprint for a building or scene, the Construction Task aims to\nbuild these buildings or scenes based on the blueprint. The blueprint, either pictures in real life or\nMinecraft-style pictures, is the reference D.\nEvaluation Metrics. MineLand gives a score based on whether the constructed buildings meet the\nblueprint’s expectations. We calculate the task scores through the VLM-based evaluations and human\nevaluation, which both use the same criteria (refer to Section Q for more details). The evaluation\nscores range from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating that the agents’ constructions more closely\nresemble the intended blueprint.\nStage Performance Tasks Given a script of a drama consisting of several behaviors, which may be a\nsingle action or an emotional expression, the Stage Performance Task aims to perform the script with\nagents as actors.\nEvaluation Metrics. We leverage two complementary evaluation metrics: an LCS (Longest Common\nSubsequence)-based metric and human evaluation. The LCS-based metric consists of two distinct\nscores: the keypoint score and the appropriateness score. We present the formulas for adding up these\ntwo scores:\nfkey + fappro = |LCS(SEQAgent, SEQ∗)|\n|SEQ∗|\n+ |LCS(SEQAgent, SEQ∗)|\n|SEQAgent|\n(1)\nwhere SEQAgent represents the action sequence generated by the agent, while SEQ∗is the ground\ntruth. LCS(A, B) denotes the LCS between A and B. |A| is the length of sequence A. The\n5Hybrid tasks resemble translation tasks in that, while a single unique translation may not exist, multiple\nreference translations can guide the process. Here references could be key rules, constraints, and key evaluation\nindicators, etc.\n6\nkeypoint score emphasizes the completeness of the enacted behaviors, ensuring all crucial actions\nand expressions are performed. The appropriateness score goes beyond completeness to evaluate\nthe overall coherence and naturalness of the performance, considering how well the behaviors flow\ntogether and align with the script’s dramatic intent. The human evaluation score is an integer between\n1 and 5, with higher scores indicating better performance. It provides a comprehensive assessment\nof the agents’ ability to not only execute actions accurately but also to deliver them naturally and\nengagingly. Details of the human evaluation criteria can be found in Section R.\nFigure 4: Illustration of the architecture of Alex.\n4\nAlex Agent\nTo truly demonstrate the challenge of this benchmark, we propose Alex6, a VLM-based agent\nas shown in Figure 4. Conventional LLM-powered AI agents depend on LLM to operate as its\nbrain, which is backed by several vital components that perform various essential functions. These\ncomponents, such as the memory component, planning component, and acting component, have been\nthoroughly studied recently. To cater to our specific requirements, we have improved these three\ncomponents (refer to Section E for more details), replaced LLM with VLM and introduced one new\ncomponent: the multitasking component. Additionally, Alex exhibits different personality traits\npredefined in the system prompt.\nMultitasking Component\nPeople often switch attention between tasks, for example cooking while\ntalking. The ability to communicate smoothly with other players while working on a task-oriented\naction is crucial in multi-agent scenarios. Therefore, we develop the mechanism of multitasking ability\nto enhance the agent’s attention control and working memory abilities inspired by the Multitasking\ntheory from the Cognition field [53]. Specifically, for attention control, the interrupt mechanism\neffectively controls attention among multiple tasks. For working memory, Alex maintains and\nprocesses information in the Memory Library. When another agent says hello to the working agent,\nthis involves saving and restoring internal states when frequent and high-speed switching between\ncommunication activities and goal-driven working actions to avoid forgetting ongoing tasks. With\nthe multitasking mechanism, Alex allows for simultaneously simulating and executing intricate\ncoordination and scheduling with multiple tasks.\n5\nExperiments\n5.1\nExperiments of Simulators Performance\nWe evaluate the number of agents that MineLand can support and compare MineLand with other\npopular Minecraft simulators. We utilize a mainstream consumer desktop PC equipped with an\nIntel i5-12400F CPU and 64GB of memory. Performance Monitor is employed to monitor the\nprocess. Our findings reveal that MineLand is capable of supporting 32 agents simultaneously while\n6Alex is the protagonist in the sandbox game Minecraft, one of the default skins for players and a character in\nthe game: https:\/\/www.minecraft.net\/zh-hans. To pay tribute, we named our proposed AI agent Alex.\n7\nproviding visual displays. When visual display is disabled, the number of concurrently running agents\nincreases to ×4 times. Furthermore, as depicted in Table 2, when MineLand and Malmo both run\n8 agents, MineLand’s CPU and memory usage are approximately 1\/3 that of Malmo’s (specifically,\n35.6% and 38.0%, respectively). It is worth noting that Malmo serves as the foundation for most\npopular Minecraft Platforms (e.g., MineDojo\/MineRL\/MarLÖ [42]), thus highlighting MineLand’s\nsuperior performance compared to the vast majority of existing Minecraft Platforms. Consequently,\nMineLand proves to be highly suitable for multi-agent environments.\n5.2\nExperiments of Social Dynamics\nIn the “unlocking tools” task with two agents (Table 3), two agents in the collaborative mode work\ntogether effectively, with a reduced workload per agent and higher communication expenses. On the\nother hand, two competitive agents worked independently and necessitated fewer code iterations. The\nprimary reason is that, in competitive relationships, agents tend to achieve more in a single iteration\nto expedite progress and outperform their opponents. However, this results in less thorough planning\nand more code errors. Consequently, multiple agents in competitive relationships require fewer code\niterations but make more mistakes.\nWe also observe that personality plays a significant role in determining the behavior of agents in\nmulti-agent societies [25]. We assigned the personality traits of high extraversion and agreeableness\nto both agents. Under this condition, the agents tended to establish collaboration and engage in\nmutual communication (co-op >8 out of 10 times). This result is consistent with human behavior [13].\nWhen no personality was set for the agents, they worked independently (co-op 0 out of 10 times). For\nmore experiments of simulating sociological phenomena with >10 agents, please refer to Section O.\nTable 2:\nPart of the comparison table of per-\nformance of Minecraft simulators.\nThe full ta-\nble is in Table 9.\nMineLandw\/o vision means\nMineLand without vision.

While Alex demonstrates a promising capability in selecting appropriate\nmaterials for both tasks, its overall construction abilities are currently limited. We posit two key\nreasons for these limitations: complex task planning and high-precision manipulation. For the\nfirst reason, construction tasks are inherently time-consuming and require sophisticated planning\nabilities. For instance, building auxiliary structures to facilitate the main construction process is\ncrucial for achieving significant height. However, Alex cannot currently plan and construct such\nauxiliary structures, hindering its ability to construct tall structures. The second reason is the high-\nprecision manipulation. The construction tasks necessitate high-precision manipulation, such as\nadding decorative details. Alex primarily utilizes high-level actions and lacks the necessary APIs to\nexecute these fine-grained manipulations effectively. These results show the challenge of this task.\n5.4\nExperiments of Stage Performance Tasks\nWe evaluate our un-finetuned Alex on four example stage performance tasks (Table 5). We found\nthat in single-agent tasks, the agent typically exhibits high scores across all three evaluation metrics.\nHowever, in multi-agent tasks, the keypoint score tends to be higher than the appropriate score\n8\nbecause the agent can understand the script and fulfill the key requirements. In contrast, the human\nevaluation scores are usually relatively lower because agents often engage in unnecessary dialogue in\nscripts that require collaboration, resulting in lower scores.\nTable 4: Human evaluation score\nand VLM-based (gpt-4o) evalua-\ntion score of Alex agent on two\nconstruction tasks.

The number in parentheses\nfollowing the script name represents the number of agents in\nthat script.

We observed that agents in a cooperative relationship required more code\niterations to finish the task, primarily because most of these iterations were dedicated to establishing\nand maintaining communication, as well as task allocation. For example, when one agent says in a\nchat that he needs two sticks, another agent will ask for getting together near the table, and then give\nthe sticks to him. However, the actual workload for each agent is reduced without considering the\nchat cost. Compared to agents working independently, the code iteration cost of agents cooperating is\nreduced by 20% per agent.\n5.6\nExperiments of Multitasking\nTo validate the impact of multitasking support in the simulator7, we conduct the obsidian mining\ntask, which takes over 8 minutes and requires multiple steps to complete. In the beginning, the agent\nis mining and encounters chat or hurt events within 8 minutes. Chat event: Another agent nearby\ninitiates a conversation with Alex. This is a low-priority event, and Alex can choose whether to\nrespond to the agent nearby. Hurt event: The agent gets hurts. For example, a zombie attacks the\nagent. This is a high-priority event, requiring Alex to stop its current task and address this event first.\nWe expect the two types of events to activate the multitasking component and the agent processes the\nmining and the special event simultaneously. Results are in Table 6. In all ten runs, we count the\nnumber of successfully handling multitasks. For the hurt event, if the agent fights back due to this\nhurt event, it is considered successful. For the chat event, if the agent responds due to the chat event,\nit is considered successful. Results reveal that Alexw\/o mt can’t process events timely, resulting in\nAlex being killed by the zombie. In contrast, Alex with a multitasking component is capable of\nmanaging multiple events (e.g., mining while chatting), autonomously determining their priority, and\naddressing the higher-priority events first. Hence, multitasking is an essential mechanism.\nTable 6: Comparison between Alex and Alexw\/o mt (Alex without the multitasking component).\nAgent\nHurt event\nChat event\nAlex\n8\/10\n2\/10\nAlexw\/o mt\n0\/10\n0\/10\n7This multitasking functionality is achieved through the synergistic interplay of two keys: the multitasking\ncomponent in Alex and the interrupt mechanism in MineLand.\n9\n6\nConclusion\nTraditional multi-agent simulators struggle with large-scale scenarios and often assume perfect\ninformation and unrealistic agent capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce MineLand,\na novel Minecraft-based simulator supporting 64 or more agents with limited senses and physical\nneeds. This forces agents to actively communicate and collaborate, fostering more ecologically valid\ninteractions. The advantage carries potential broader impacts across various domains as discussed in\nSection B.\n```\n\n#### 5. 学生问题\n问题1：介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」\n问题2：这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？\n问题3：这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？\n\n\n请输出论文总结\n### 输出格式（输出语言用中文）\n```\n## 💡 解答问题1 (...复述学生问题1...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (...复述学生问题2...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (...复述学生问题3...)\n...\n```\n","llm_summary_res":"## 🌟 论文解读 | MineLand：模拟大规模多智能体交互的Minecraft模拟器\n\n## 📌 背景痛点\/本文动机\n传统的多智能体模拟器在处理大规模场景时面临资源消耗过大的问题，并且通常假设智能体拥有完美信息和无限能力，这与现实世界中的人类交互存在较大差距。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了MineLand，一个基于Minecraft的多智能体模拟器，旨在模拟更接近现实世界的多智能体交互。\n\n## 🚀 核心方法\n💡 创新点1：大规模可扩展性\nMineLand通过将每个Minecraft客户端简化为单个线程，优化了性能开销，从而支持64个或更多智能体在主流消费级桌面PC上运行。\n\n💡 创新点2：有限的模态感知\nMineLand模拟了人类的视觉和听觉机制，对智能体的感知能力施加了限制，包括距离衰减、环境遮挡和方向约束，使其更接近现实世界。\n\n💡 创新点3：物理需求\nMineLand将真实的物理需求（如食物、氧气和饥饿）集成到智能体中，使其需要管理资源并与其他智能体竞争或合作，以维持生存。\n\n💡 创新点4：多任务处理框架Alex\nMineLand引入了基于多任务理论的AI智能体框架Alex，允许智能体同时执行复杂的协调和调度，以处理多个任务。\n\n## 📈 实验结果\n实验结果表明，MineLand在支持大规模智能体、有限的模态感知和物理需求方面表现出色。此外，Alex框架能够有效地处理多任务，并在合作模式下提高效率。\n\n## 💬 可借鉴之处\nMineLand为研究多智能体交互提供了一个强大的平台，其创新的设计和功能可以应用于人类动力学、社会心理学、机器人技术和游戏设计等领域。此外，Alex框架的多任务处理机制为开发更智能的AI智能体提供了新的思路。","llm_summary_res_status":200,"order":15,"query_answer":"## 💡 解答问题1 (介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」)\n\n这篇论文提出的benchmark是MineLand Benchmark Suite，它是一个用于评估多智能体在MineLand模拟器中能力的基准测试套件。MineLand Benchmark Suite提供了大量的任务，包括程序性任务、创造性任务和混合任务。程序性任务和创造性任务的数量分别是MineDojo的两倍，而混合任务是一个新的类别，它结合了程序性任务和创造性任务的特点。此外，MineLand Benchmark Suite还支持灵活的玩家数量和探索模式，包括合作模式和竞争模式。\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？)\n\nMineLand Benchmark Suite的设备条件取决于任务的规模和复杂性。对于大多数任务，一个主流的消费级桌面PC就足够了。例如，在实验中，MineLand在配备Intel i5-12400F CPU和64GB内存的PC上运行了32个智能体。然而，对于更复杂的任务，可能需要更强大的硬件，例如更多的CPU核心、更多的内存或GPU。至于模型训练和推理，论文中没有明确说明使用了什么设备，但可以推测，由于MineLand Benchmark Suite支持大规模的多智能体交互，因此可能需要使用高性能的计算集群或云服务来进行模型训练和推理。\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？)\n\nMineLand Benchmark Suite的环境设计考虑了奖励机制的合理性和鲁棒性，以避免reward hacking。例如，在创造性任务中，MineLand使用VLM-based evaluations和human evaluation两种评估方法来计算任务得分，这样可以更全面地评估智能体的表现。此外，在混合任务中，MineLand引入了LCS-based metric和human evaluation两种评估指标，以评估智能体的行为完整性和表演的自然性。这些评估方法可以有效地防止reward hacking，并支持RL类模型在MineLand Benchmark Suite上取得优异的性能。","query_answer_status":200}

Although they are trained in large text\ncorpora, their superior problem-solving capacity is not limited to canonical language processing\ndomains. LLMs already demonstrate the potential to tackle complex tasks that were previously\npresumed exclusive to domain-specific algorithms or human experts, ranging from mathematical\nreasoning (Imani et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2022) to answering questions of pro-\nfessional law (Blair-Stanek et al., 2023; Choi et al., 2023; Nay, 2022) and medicine (Nov et al.,\n2023; Yang et al., 2023; Jeblick et al., 2022). More recently, some research has shown the possi-\nbility of using LLMs to generate complex plans for robots and game AI (Liang et al., 2022; Wang\net al., 2023b;a; Yao et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023), marking an important milestone for LLMs as\ngeneralist intelligent agents.\nIn this work, we would like to further investigate the planning capacity of LLMs. Specifically, we\nare interested in planning in a multi-agent system (Stone & Veloso, 2000), i.e.multi-agent plan-\nning. Compared to planning for a single agent, which has been extensively studied by previous\nresearch (Wang et al., 2023b;a), multi-agent planning imposes much higher problem-solving com-\nplexity due to the exponentially growing action space (w.r.t. number of agents). The planner has\nto simultaneously control multiple agents, avoid possible conflicts, and coordinate them into com-\npleting a shared goal that requires sophisticated collaborations. To understand to which extent can\nLLMs obtain multi-agent planning skills, we first establish a new benchmark, CUISINEWORLD as\nillustrated in Figure 1.\nTo incorporate agent AI into video games, we main design an infrastructure - MINDAGENT - in-\nspired by multi-agent task allocation optimization theories to facilitate LLM multi-agent planning\ncapabilities. Our infrastructure enables LLMs to perform complex coordination and scheduling\nwith multiple different agents. We conduct comprehensive evaluations with recently introduced\nLLMs playing our game with our infrastructure, including GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA. Through\nthe proposed MINDAGENT interactive multi-agent planning framework for LLMs, we make the fol-\nlowing key observations: 1) zero shot multi-agent planning: Without bells and whistles, powerful\npretrained LLMs like GPT-4 are capable of scheduling multiple agents (ranging from 2 to 4) into\ncompleting dishes, and even collaborate with human players, by merely reading simple game in-\nstructions and recipes; 2) planning with advanced prompting: We are able to significantly boost\ntheir multi-agent planning performances by leveraging the emergent in-context learning capabil-\nity (Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2021): adding very few expert demonstrations even from dif-\nferent game levels to the prompt, explaining the rationale of certain actions as in Chain-of-Thought\nprompting (Wei et al., 2022), and providing on-the-fly feedback to the LLMs during planning; 3)\ngeneralist potentials: LLMs exhibits great potentials of being generalist multi-agent planner as it\nhas strong generalization to coordinate more agents with examples of fewer agents, and adaptation\nto new game domains like Minecraft.\nWhile compared to canonical domain-specific automated planning systems, multi-agent planning\nwith LLMs can still be bottlenecked by challenging computation cost, context length limitation,\nnon-optimal plans, etc., it has the potential of improving from data without fine-tuning (via in-\ncontext learning), seamlessly adapting to planning problems from different domains and offering\nmore flexible interfaces. We hope our findings on LLMs for general-purpose scheduling and coor-\ndination can help shed some light on how such skills can be obtained by learning from large text\ncorpora, and facilitate the emergence of better LLM planners.\nTo summarize, our key contributions are as follows:\n• We establish a new gaming scenario and related benchmark based on a multi-agent virtual kitchen\nenvironment, CUISINEWORLD. It adopts a minimal text-based game format and supports various\nplanning task structures and difficulties, making it an ideal test bed for the emergent multi-agent\nplanning (scheduling and coordination) capacity of LLMs.\n• We introduce MINDAGENT, an infrastructure for interactive multi-agent planning with LLMs,\nwhich demonstrates the in-context learning multi-agent planning capacity of LLMs and brings\nseveral prompting techniques that help facilitate their planning ability, including providing few-\nshot demonstrations, planning rationals, and environmental feedback.\n2\n• We conduct extensive evaluations with multiple LLMs and prompting settings on our benchmark.\nExperimental results confirm their potential on being generalist multi-agent planners in terms of\ngeneralizing to more agents.\n• We deploy our system into real-world gaming scenarios and demonstrate its capabilities in human-\nAI interactions.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nMulti-Agent Coordination. The field of multi-agent collaborations boasts a comprehensive body\nof literature. Traditionally, such collaborations have been modeled using MDP\/POMDP (Lowe et al.,\n2017; Rashid et al., 2020; Jain et al., 2019) frameworks.\nHowever, there has been a recent shift towards utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for these\ncollaborations. For instance, Zhang et al. (2023b) delved into how large language models might\ncommunicate and cooperate in a watch-and-help (WAH) task. Meanwhile, Zhang et al. (2023a)\ninvestigated a two-agent collaboration game inspired by the simpler dynamics of the two-agent\nOvercooked-style game. Notably, their research chiefly concentrated on the task success rate, with\nmost studies typically anchored to a singular task objective. In contrast, we emphasize the impor-\ntance of collaboration efficiency in scenarios encompassing multiple task objectives. Further, our\nresearch uniquely focuses on evaluating the collaborative efficiency of more than two agents. Ad-\nditionally, while other works like Park et al. (2023) simulate each agent individually, we employ a\ncentralized system. This approach not only significantly reduces the number of API calls but also\nreduces context length, making it more appropriate for gaming applications.\nPlanning with LLMs. There exists a number of works that leverage LLMs to perform task planning\n(Huang et al., 2022a; Wang et al., 2023a; Yao et al., 2023). They leverage the LLMs’ internet-scale\ndomain knowledge and emergent zero-shot planning abilities to perform complex task planning and\nreasoning. Recent works in robotics also leverage LLMs to perform task planning, they decompose\na natural language instruction into a sequence of subtasks, either in natural language form or in\npython code (Ahn et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022b; Liang et al., 2022). Then they use a low-level\ncontroller to execute these subtasks. Additionally, (Huang et al., 2022b; Liang et al., 2022; Wang\net al., 2023b) also incorporate environment feedback to improve task performance.\nBenchmarks using Games.\nNumerous games have been developed to study task planning Baker\net al. (2022); Carroll et al. (2019), yet only a handful delve into multi-agent collaborations. Even\nwithin this limited subset, the focus predominantly remains on two-agent interactions where re-\nsponsibilities are not evenly distributed. As evidenced by (Wan et al., 2022; Puig et al., 2020), it’s\ncommon for one player to assume a dominant role while the other provides support. In contrast, our\npaper assumes equal responsibilities across agents, and we expand our investigation to encompass\ncollaborations involving more than just two agents, even with human players. While some previous\nstudies have ventured into multi-task settings, none have delved into scenarios where agents must\ncomplete multiple distinct tasks using competing resources within a single episode. Furthermore,\nour game presents tasks with varied levels of difficulty.\nAdditionally, our work distinguishes itself from Carroll et al. (2019). Contrary to their settings, our\ngame settings feature a diverse array of tools and task objectives, thereby generating an exponentially\nlarger task space. A comparison between our work and other related games is shown in Table 1.\n3\nTHE NEW GAMING CUISINEWORLD DESIGN AND BENCHMARK\nWe introduce CUISINEWORLD as a novel and flexible game for multi-agent scheduling and coor-\ndination in a virtual kitchen environment. In this game, a multi-agent system needs to overlook\nmultiple agents and coordinate them, with the goal of completing as many dish orders as possible.\nIt is equipped with a textual interface since our focus is evaluating LLM-based planning agents.\nOur modularized design separates tasks and game engines, allowing more tasks (type of dishes) and\ndomains (how to implement the “kitchen”: text-based engine, Unity, Minecraft, etc.) to be included.\n3\nBenchmark\nMulti-task\nObject\nInteraction\nTool\nUse\nMaximum\nAgents\nCollabo-\nration\nHuman\nin-the-loop\nProcedural\nLevel Generation\nALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2020)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n1\n✗\n✗\n✗\nWAH (Puig et al., 2020)\n✓\n✓\n✗\n2\n✓\n✓\n✗\nTextWorld (Cˆot´e et al., 2019)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n1\n✗\n✗\n✓\nGenerative Agents (Park et al., 2023)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n25\n✗\n✗\n✓\nEMATP (Liu et al., 2022)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n2\n✓\n✗\n✗\nOvercooked-AI (Carroll et al., 2019)\n✗\n✓\n✓\n2\n✓\n✓\n✗\nHandMeThat (Wan et al., 2022)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n2\n✓\n✗\n✗\nDialFRED (Gao et al., 2022)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n2\n✓∗\n✗\n✗\nTEACH (Padmakumar et al., 2022)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n2\n✓∗\n✗\n✗\nCerealBar (Suhr et al., 2019)\n✗\n✗\n✗\n2\n✓\n✗\n✗\nLIGHT (Urbanek et al., 2019)\n✓\n✗\n✗\n1369\n✗\n✓\n✓\nDiplomacy (Bakhtin et al., 2022)\n✗\n✗\n✗\n7\n✓\n✓\n✗\nCUISINEWORLD (Ours)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n4+\n✓\n✓\n✓\nTable 1: Comparsion between CUISINEWORLD and other related benchmarks. Multi-task: The benchmark\ncontains multiple different tasks. Object Interaction: Agents have to manipulate or engage with different\nitems or environmental elements to achieve certain goals with irreversible actions. Tool Use: Completing tasks\nnecessitates the use of specific tools by the agents. Maximum Agents: This denotes the upper limit of agents\nthat can be present in a single experiment. Collaboration: Many tasks mandate teamwork and collaboration\nbetween different agents. Human in-the-loop: The framework allows humans to join the game and collaborate\nactively with the agents. Procedural Level Generation: There’s flexibility in adding new tasks, making the\ngame dynamic and adaptable.\n∗: Notably, even though multiple agents can be present, the second agent is\nlimited to communicating with the first agent. The second agent cannot interact with the environment in an\nactive gaming capacity.\nType\nArguments\nDescription\ngoto\nagent\nlocation\nMove agent to\nlocation\nget\nagent\nlocation\n(item)\nagent obtain item\nfrom location\nput\nagent\nlocation\nagent put everything\nit holds to location\nactivate\nagent\nlocation\nagent turn on\nlocation\nnoop\nagent\nnot dispatching agent\nTable 2: Action space in CUISINEWORLD.\nNum. of\ntools\nNum. of\nings.\nNum. of\nsteps\nMax. mix\nsize\n8\n6\n8\n6\n14\n15\n11\n15\n8\n7\n10\n7\n3\n5\n4\n5\n1\n2\n3\n4\nFigure 2:\nDish distribution over the number of\ntools and ingredients (ings.)\ninvolved, cooking\nsteps, and maximum mixture size as in the recipe.\n3.1\nTASK DEFINITION\nWe follow prior works (Yao et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2023) to interactively evaluate\nLLMs as planning agents. Overall, the interactive evaluation can be formulated as a Markov\nDecision Process (S, A, T , R, G), with state space S, action space A, (effectively indicating all the\npossible schedules that can be made at a single time step), transition dynamics T , reward function R\nand task instruction space G. Note that, although there are multiple agents inside CUISINEWORLD\nthat can be coordinated, as we mentioned above, we adopt a centralized planning scheme and thereby\nformulate our game as a single-agent and fully-observable decision-making problem. An illustration\nof the state & action space and the possible tasks of our game can be found in Figure 1.\nState Space S. In CUISINEWORLD virtual kitchen, there are two types of entity: location and\nagent. For each entity, the game will provide a set of descriptions, the aggregated descriptions\nof all entities will be the state returned by our game. A location can be storage, where you\ncould obtain ingredients and dispense waste, a serving table, where you should put the completed\ndish on, or a cooking tool, e.g. pan, blender. We offer up to two descriptions for each location:\ninside(location, items), indicating what items (some ingredients, completed dishes, etc.)\nare now inside the location; and occupy(location), suggesting location is now being used\n4\nand cannot be touched, e.g. an activated blender. A agent is an entity that can be dispatched\nto complete the task, and we provide up to three descriptions for each agent: at(location,\nagent), indicating now agent is at location; hold(agent, items), suggesting what\nitems agent is holding; and finally occupy(agent), implying agent is now operating a tool,\ne.g. chopping some fruits, and will not respond to any dispatching command.\nAction Space A. An action in CUISINEWORLD is a list of dispatching commands. Given N\nagent entities, a total of N commands need to be generated. The agent provides the follow-\ning commands (also illustrated in Table 2): 1) goto(agent, location), to let agent move\nto location; 2) get(agent, location, item), to let agent get a specific item from\nlocation; 3) put(agent, location), to put whatever agent is holding into location;\n4) activate(agent, location), to let agent turn on location if it is a cooking tool,\ne.g. blender; 5) noop(agent), to have agent perform no actions in this round of dispatching.\nWe will provide more detailed illustrations and rules about the action space in appendix. Note\nthat, to avoid the possible confusion of multiple agents being dispatched to operate with the same\nlocation, the dispatcher also needs to properly order the dispatching commands as they will be\nexecuted sequentially.\nTasks and Reward.\nA task in CUISINEWORLD is a dish order, ranging from the most basic\ntunaSashimi, which can be made by simply chopping some tuna meat, to sophisticated dishes\nlike porkPasta that requires various cooking tools. In a game episode with maximum steps of T,\nevery τint steps (we name this task interval), a new task or dish order will be added to the active task\nlist. A task will be viewed as completed and removed from the active task list when a matched dish\nhas been put on the serving table. On the contrary, a task will be deemed to have failed and removed\nfrom the list when it reaches its lifetime τlft. Lifetime depends on the complexity of the dish and\ndetails can be found in appendix. Along with the tasks, the game provides rewards & penalties or\nfeedback on certain occasions, e.g. when a task is just completed, some infeasible commands are\ndispatched, etc. Due to the space limit, we defer details on tasks to Appendix B..\n3.2\nIMPLEMENTING CUISINEWORLD\nThe implementation of CUISINEWORLD mostly follows the spirit of Overcooked!, a renowned video\ngame. Therefore we refer to many of its game mechanisms while simplifying some of them, e.g. we\nskip low-level control and assume all agent have access to all location at any time (detailed\ncomparisons between CUISINEWORLD and the original video game can be found in appendix).\nSpecifically, we crawled the rules and recipes from the community-contributed wiki1, streamlined\nthem and made necessary modifications, ending up with the basic version of CUISINEWORLD com-\nprising 10 types of location (serving table, storage, and 8 different cooking tools), 27 types of\ningredients, and 33 unique dishes. We group the dishes based on their difficulty to make (primarily\nthe number of cooking tools involved) and design 12 game levels, which are further categorized\ninto 4 classes: entry, simple, intermediate and advanced, with 3 levels each. Note that the recipes,\ndishes, and levels can be easily extended to allow more challenging tasks.\n3.3\nEVALUATION METRIC\nCollaboration Score (CoS). We would like to evaluate to which extent the dispatcher (played by an\nLLM) can coordinate multiple agents into completing dish orders, across different scenarios. Similar\nto the original Overcooked! game, we are particularly interested in this question: Can the dispatcher\nstill coordinate the agents into efficient collaborations with smaller τint, i.e. more dish orders are\nflooding in? Our hypothesis is, an ideal dispatcher should be capable of coordinating agents until\nthere are way more tasks than the system can handle. Therefore, we introduce collaboration score\nCoS, defined as below:\nCoS = 1\nM\nM\nX\ni=1\n#completed task\n\u0002\nτint,(i)\n\u0003\n#completed task\n\u0002\nτint,(i)\n\u0003\n+ #failed task\n\u0002\nτint,(i)\n\u0003,\n(1)\nwhere M is the total amount of τint we evaluate. Effectively, CoS is the average task completion rate\nacross different τint conditions. In our default setting, we use M = 5. While the actual values of τint\n1https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1769729191\n5\nFigure 3: Our overview of our MINDAGENT architecture. Planning Skill & Tool Use: The game environment\nrequires diverse planning skills and tool use to complete tasks. It emits related game information. This module\nalso converts relevant game data into a structured text format so the LLMs can process it. LLM: The main\nworkhorse of our infrastructure makes decisions, which is a dispatcher for the multi-agent system. Memory\nHistory: A storage utility that stores relevant information. Action Module, extract actions from text inputs and\nconvert them into domain-specific language. Validate DSLs so they don’t cause errors when executing.\ndepend on the game level, we ensure they elicit a wide range of difficulty including both extremely\nrelaxed and intense scenarios.\nIn a word, CuisineWorld is a game that emulates a virtual kitchen, where several robots are com-\nmanded to use various cooking tools and ingredients to prepare as many dish orders as possible in a\nlimited period of time. To facilitate collaboration, new orders will keep flooding in while the exist-\ning ones should be completed before expiration. Therefore, LLMs need to properly coordinate these\nrobots to maximize overall productivity. CUISINEWORLD also offers game levels with a wide range\nof planning difficulty: dishes with different complexity (number of ingredients and tools involved),\nnumber of agents, order frequency and lifetime, etc, making it an ideal test bed for LLM-based\nmulti-agent planning.\n4\nMINDAGENT: INFRASTRUCTURE FOR GAMING AI\n4.1\nINFRASTRUCTURE\nOur first foray into the challenging CUISINEWORLD benchmark is an interactive multi-agent plan-\nning framework for LLMs: MINDAGENT It adopts a minimalist design for the purpose of demon-\nstrating the emergent capacity of LLMs in scheduling and coordination, while also bringing in ex-\nploratory prompting techniques that facilitate better planning and shed some light on future ap-\nproaches. Our infrastructure follows in-context learning. We will outline the key techniques below:\nTo facilitate in-context learning, our MINDAGENT infrastructure is composed of three primary com-\nponents: the prompt, current state, and memory.\nWithin the prompt component, there are four distinct sub-components: recipes, general instructions,\ninference knowledge, and a one-shot demo.\nRecipes. outline the hierarchical procedure for preparing various dishes at the given level. They\nspecify the necessary ingredients for each intermediate or final product, the appropriate tools re-\nquired, and the expected outcome post-cooking.\n6\nInstructions. detail the foundational rules of CUISINEWORLD. These instructions delineate the\narray of actions agents can undertake within the game and enumerate the characteristics of every tool\navailable in the current kitchen scenario. Moreover, they inform agents about the base ingredients\nretrievable from storage, as well as all potential intermediate products they can procure. Agents are\nalso explicitly advised to remain cautious about feedback from the environment.\nInference Knowledge. houses insights and helpful hints for the agent. When utilized appropriately,\nthese hints can guide agents to sidestep potential errors and enhance their collaborative efficiency.\nOne-shot Demo. presents a step-by-step demonstration of the preparation of a distinct dish, differ-\nent from other dishes at the current level. This demonstration spans several time steps, each of which\nis incorporated as part of the prompt. The demonstration illustrates the major procedures for cook-\ning one dish in CUISINEWORLD, including obtaining ingredients, putting ingredients into different\ntools, transporting intermediate ingredients, and delivering the final dish to the serving table.\nCurrent State. provides a snapshot of the prevailing observations from the environment. It en-\ncompasses information such as the agents’ locations, the objects currently in the agents’ possession,\nthe tools that are accessible within the environment, the ingredients present within each tool, and\nthe tools that are actively in use. Moreover, it includes optional feedback from the environment,\ntriggered when the agents’ actions contravene the environment rules— for instance, when assigning\ntwo distinct actions to the same agent.\nMemory History. archives the interaction history with the environment. Specifically, it chronicles\nthe state of the environment and the state of the agents at every time step.\nIn addition to the prompt modules, additional modules are implemented to help interface between\nLLMs and CUISINEWORLD.\nAction Extraction. employs a regular expression matching procedure to distill agent actions from\nthe LLM’s textual output. This module is indispensable because, on occasion, the LLM’s output is\nnot clean. The output contains information reflecting its internal thought processes. At times, the\nLLM might even issue apologies for prior missteps in reaction to environment feedback.\nAction Validation. utilizes a look-ahead checking mechanism. This module parses the proposed\nactions, assessing their feasibility. Should an action be deemed inexecutable, an error message is\npromptly returned.\n4.2\nINFRASTRUCTURE MECHANISM\nAssuming a multi-agent system with a total of N agents, the system must complete a sequence of P\ndifferent tasks. Each task has Mp different sub-tasks. Furthermore, the number and types of tasks\nare unknown at the beginning of the episode. The environment will sample a task for the agents to\nfinish for a given interval. Then the agents need to complete the designated task along with other\ntasks in the task queue. In addition, each task has an expiration time. After the expiration time, the\ntask will be marked as a failure. The objective of the multi-agent system is to finish as many tasks\nas possible and fail as fewer tasks as possible within a given time frame.\nWe aim to find valid and optimal task planning, scheduling, and allocations. We define qpim and\ncpim as quality and cost, respectively, for allocating agent i to work on the sub-task m for the p th\ntask in the episode. Then the combined utility for the sub-task is:\nupim =\n\u001aqpim −cpim,\nif agent i can execute sub-task m for the p th task in the episode\n−∞.\notherwise\nWe define the assignment of sub-task m to agent i as\nvpim =\n\u001a1,\nagent i is assigned to sub-task m for the p th task in the episode\n0.\notherwise\nThe goal is to maximize the utility of the episode under a time constraint. Define the execution\ntime for task m by agent i for the p th task in the episode as τpim, and the maximum time allowed\nto execute the task as Tmax, we can express the task decomposition and assignment problem as\nfollows:\n7\narg max\nv\nP\nX\np=1\nN\nX\ni=1\nMp\nX\nm=1\nupimvpim\n(2)\nSubject to:\nP\np\nP\ni\nP\nm τpimvpim\n≤Tmax\nP\ni vpim\n≤1\n∀m ∈M, ∀p ∈P\nvpim\n∈{0, 1}\n∀i ∈N, ∀m ∈M, ∀p ∈P\nAs pointed out by (Korsah et al., 2013), this problem cannot be solved in polynomial time. In this\nwork, we tackle this problem by using large-language models.\nOur prompt design choices try to help LLM system solve Equation 2. In practice, we reformu-\nlate Equation 2 with qualities or rewards expressed in natural languages as environment feedback.\nFor example, when the agent successfully collects an item, the environment emits a signal “collect\nfinish.” When the dispatcher assigns a different task to the same agent, the environment will emit a\nsignal “agent ids cannot be the same.” As rewards are not immediately observable, we borrow sprites\nfrom temporal difference learning. We accumulate state-action history into memory history. Due\nto context length limits, it’s infeasible to fit the entire history into the context window. We select a\nfixed horizon history as a part of the prompt to guide the model performance. We further express\nthe constraints of the system in natural language formats and repeat important constraints multiple\ntimes if necessary.\n5\nEXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS\nOverview. We conduct extensive experiments in CUISINEWORLD. We first introduce the exper-\niment settings and present an analysis of empirical results in CUISINEWORLD. Our experiments\nfocus on addressing the following research questions:\nQ1: How efficiently can the model dispatch multiple agents?\nQ2: Can the model dispatch agents for dynamic, on-the-fly goals across different tasks?\nQ3: How do various components of the input prompt influence the model’s performance?\nQ4: How do other LLMs perform compared to GPT-4?\nQ5: To what extent can the existing methods collaborate with human users?\nQ6: What’s the human perception of collaborating with numerous intelligent agents?\n5.1\nLLM SETTINGS\nWe perform experiments on CUISINEWORLD through OpenAI APIs and anthropic APIs. All GPT-\n4 experiments are using gpt-4-0613 model, and all chat-GPT experiments are using gpt-3.5-turbo-\n0613. For Llama 2 experiments, we use hugging face inference endpoints Llama-2-70b-chat-hf. We\nset the temperature for all experiments to 0.1 following (Wang et al., 2023a). We report the average\nresults over three episodes.\n5.2\nEXPERIMENT SETTING I: LLMS DISPATCH MULTI-AGENTS (NPC)\nCollaboration Efficiency (Q1, Q2). Figure 4 and Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5 reports the system\nperformance under different settings. In particular, Table 3 reports the multi-agent collaboration\nresults among two agents. Table 4 reports the multi-agent collaboration results among three agents,\nand Table 5 reports the multi-agent collaboration results among four agents. Figure 4 displays the\ncollaboration efficiency curve.\nAs shown in Figure 4, across different task levels, more agents generally lead to better collaboration\nefficiencies. As the collaboration efficiency curve is generally higher with more agents.\nComputing CoS by levels also reveals that more agents will lead to better collaboration efficiencies.\nAs shown in the tables, the CoS score is the highest when there are two agents in two cases.

The CoS score is the highest\nwhen there are four agents in three cases. The results also confirm that more agents will lead to\nhigher collaboration efficiencies.\nFindings. First, we observe that the system performance is generally better when there are more\nagents, indicating that LLM dispatcher can coordinate more agents to execute tasks more efficiently.\nSecond, we observe that the system performance degrades with more agents in less demanding\nconditions, indicating that LLM dispatcher struggles when there are fewer tasks.\n5.3\nEXPERIMENT SETTING II: HUMAN AND MULTI-NPCS WITH LLMS\n5.3.1\nHUMAN DATA COLLECTION\nHuman Testing of Study Protocol. Before starting the experiment, a webpage introduction to\nthe game is handed to the players. It contains rules and the basic controls of the game. Then we\nrandomly assign the playing order. Participants can drop out of the testing at any time as they wise;\nin that case, their data will be discarded. The human evaluation interface is shown in Appendix D.\nMeasurement. In the background, we collect the number of failed and successful tasks during the\nparticipant’s interaction with the game system. In addition, we record the entire action history of\nplayers and intelligent agents. Therefore, we can replay action histories for further analysis. After\neach episode, the participants must complete a survey about their engagement with the system on a\n5-point likert chart.\nOur objective measure is intended to evaluate the human AI teaming performance, and the subjective\nmeasure is designed to evaluate users’ perceptions of the system.\n5.3.2\nEXPERIMENT II SETTING\nWe conducted a user study in our gaming environment that tries to answer Q5, Q6.\n9\n2-agent\nvery simple\nsimple\nintermediate\nadvanced\nAvg.\nlevel 0\nlevel 1\nlevel 7\nlevel 2\nlevel 4\nlevel 8\nlevel 3\nlevel 9\nlevel 10\nlevel 5\nlevel 11\nlevel 12\nGPT4 τint,(1)\n18\/54\n18\/56\n12\/31\n14\/34\n12\/30\n3\/30\n10\/26\n7\/20\n7\/23\n6\/23\n6\/21\n10\/36\n0.318\nGPT4 τint,(2)\n18\/31\n17\/34\n10\/23\n13\/26\n12\/22\n9\/22\n10\/17\n8\/11\n6\/12\n5\/13\n4\/14\n8\/21\n0.486\nGPT4 τint,(3)\n18\/25\n19\/25\n10\/17\n16\/18\n11\/18\n6\/16\n11\/13\n6\/8\n7\/10\n8\/10\n9\/9\n8\/17\n0.709\nGPT4 τint,(4)\n18\/18\n18\/19\n12\/12\n11\/14\n11\/12\n7\/11\n12\/12\n8\/8\n9\/9\n6\/7\n8\/9\n11\/12\n0.912\nGPT4 τint,(5)\n18\/18\n17\/17\n12\/12\n11\/13\n11\/13\n9\/9\n11\/11\n4\/5\n7\/7\n8\/8\n8\/8\n9\/12\n0.937\nCoS\n0.727\n0.706\n0.682\n0.687\n0.664\n0.504\n0.764\n0.725\n0.701\n0.661\n0.692\n0.559\n0.673\nTable 3: 2 agents performance on different tasks\n3-agent\nvery simple\nsimple\nintermediate\nadvanced\nAverage\nlevel 0\nlevel 1\nlevel 7\nlevel 2\nlevel 4\nlevel 8\nlevel 3\nlevel 9\nlevel 10\nlevel 5\nlevel 11\nlevel 12\nGPT4 τint,(1)\n21\/55\n24\/55\n16\/33\n17\/33\n9\/28\n6\/32\n12\/25\n5\/20\n8\/21\n7\/22\n7\/22\n9\/26\n0.368\nGPT4 τint,(2)\n20\/31\n25\/33\n11\/22\n4\/24\n13\/24\n7\/21\n14\/20\n9\/12\n9\/13\n7\/14\n8\/14\n10\/23\n0.549\nGPT4 τint,(3)\n22\/25\n21\/26\n17\/17\n11\/20\n9\/17\n4\/15\n13\/14\n8\/8\n12\/12\n7\/7\n9\/10\n10\/16\n0.791\nGPT4 τint,(4)\n22\/22\n20\/21\n14\/14\n9\/13\n7\/10\n6\/10\n10\/10\n6\/7\n10\/10\n5\/8\n7\/8\n11\/13\n0.846\nGPT4 τint,(5)\n20\/20\n15\/16\n11\/12\n10\/14\n10\/11\n8\/9\n12\/12\n6\/6\n8\/8\n5\/5\n8\/8\n6\/10\n0.914\nCoS\n0.781\n0.778\n0.780\n0.528\n0.600\n0.455\n0.822\n0.771\n0.815\n0.689\n0.733\n0.570\n0.694\nTable 4: 3 agents performance on different tasks\n4-agent\nvery simple\nsimple\nintermediate\nadvanced\nAverage\nlevel 0\nlevel 1\nlevel 7\nlevel 2\nlevel 4\nlevel 8\nlevel 3\nlevel 9\nlevel 10\nlevel 5\nlevel 11\nlevel 12\nGPT4 τint,(1)\n22\/54\n18\/55\n17\/34\n13\/34\n8\/28\n9\/33\n16\/27\n5\/20\n8\/23\n5\/22\n8\/22\n8\/35\n0.349\nGPT4 τint,(2)\n24\/32\n21\/33\n14\/24\n14\/25\n12\/24\n11\/22\n16\/19\n7\/12\n9\/15\n7\/14\n6\/12\n12\/23\n0.590\nGPT4 τint,(3)\n23\/25\n23\/26\n13\/18\n11\/19\n10\/17\n11\/17\n15\/17\n8\/9\n11\/11\n7\/8\n10\/11\n9\/17\n0.785\nGPT4 τint,(4)\n22\/22\n21\/22\n14\/14\n7\/15\n10\/13\n10\/12\n12\/13\n9\/9\n10\/10\n6\/7\n8\/8\n9\/13\n0.875\nGPT4 τint,(5)\n14\/18\n20\/20\n14\/14\n7\/13\n9\/11\n7\/8\n12\/12\n5\/5\n7\/7\n6\/6\n3\/5\n7\/10\n0.859\nCoS\n0.771\n0.761\n0.761\n0.505\n0.592\n0.626\n0.848\n0.744\n0.790\n0.692\n0.675\n0.534\n0.692\nTable 5: 4 agents performance on different tasks\nThe user study evaluates the LLM dispatcher’s capabilities of collaborating with humans, where\nparticipants are collaborating with 1,2,3 agents or working alone on the virtual cooking tasks. We\nconsider the most general setting, where the LLM works on the unseen task, level 3.\n5.3.3\nEXPERIMENT II DESIGN\nHypotheses. The user study tests the following hypotheses:\n• H1: Task productivity. Participants have higher productivity if collaborating with AI agents.\n• H2: Task productivity with more agents. Participants have higher productivity if collaborating\nwith more AI agents.\n• H3: Perception of the robot. Participants would have higher perceived task efficiency and have\nmore fun playing the game due to collaboration.\nManipulated Variables. We use a within-subject design for our experiment. In particular, every\nuser tries to finish the task by himself or collaborates with different numbers of robots with varying\ndegrees of competency. We randomize the order of the treatment to mitigate practice effects, fatigue\neffects, and carryover effects.\n• Single agent: Participants work on the task by themselves.\n• LLM powered multi-agent system: Participants collaborate with the multi-agent system pow-\nered by LLM.\n• Random agent: Random agents execute random actions from a pool of valid actions. Participants\ncollaborate with random agents.\nMain Results. We recruited 12 subjects for our study. Among them, there are two females and 10\nmales.\nWe use ANOVA to test the effects of different experimental conditions on collaboration performance\nand subjective perception of the AI agents. Tukey HSD tests are conducted on all possible pairs of\nexperimental conditions.\n10\n(a) Collaboration score We can\ntell that the collaboration score is\nhigher if more agents are collab-\norating with human players, even\nthough the difference is not signif-\nicant.\n(b) Perceived Enjoyment Humans\nenjoy the game more if they col-\nlaborate with the right number of\nagents\n(c) Perceived more fun due to col-\nlaboration. Players enjoy the game\nmore because of collaborating with\ncompetent agents.\n(d) Perceived Assisting. There is\nno significant difference in terms\nof human perceptions of helpful-\nness when collaborating with more\nagents, even though the task suc-\ncess rate is higher.\n(e)\nPerceived\ndependability.\nWhen collaborating with more\nagents,\nplayers depend on the\nagents more.\n(f) Perceived Predictability. There\nis no difference in terms of the\npredictability\nof\nagents’\nbehav-\niors when collaborating with more\nagents.\n(g) Perceived productivity. Play-\ners think collaborating with AI\nagents will improve productivity.\n(h) Perceived Trust. There is no\ndifference in terms of trust when\ncollaborating with more agents.\nFigure 5: Human Evaluations\nFindings. We find significant effects on team collaboration success rate F(4, 55) = 28.11, p <\n0.001. Post-hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD tests revealed that the team of the player with\nLLM agents achieves a higher success rate than a human working alone, p < 0.001 across different\nnumbers of agents, confirming H1. Even though the success rate is generally higher when collab-\norating with more agents, there is no significant effect compared with collaborating with one agent,\ncollaborating with two agents p = 0.774, or collaborating with three agents p = 0.231. We observe\nthat human players have more fun playing the game when collaborating with LLM-powered intel-\nligent agents than playing alone, p = 0.0126. Players feel that collaboration with intelligent agents\nleads to higher productivity, p = 0.0104, thus confirming H3.\nIn addition, when playing with intelligent agents, human players will take their actions based on\nother players’ actions p = 0.00266. Human players also found that intelligent agents are more\npredictable compared with random agents p < 0.001.\nFurther insights from player feedback highlighted an intriguing trade-off: while more agents im-\nproved overall task success rates, it reduced the game’s enjoyment. Often, players felt sidelined and\nless involved. Thus, game developers should adjust AI performance to maintain player engagement\n11\nand fun. As indicated by Yuan et al. (2022), aligning human values with AIs might be a promising\nway to solve this problem.\n5.4\nVISUALING ”CUISINEWORLD”\nTo implement CUISINEWORLD into a real game system, we built on top of Gao et al. (2020). In our\ngame, as visually depicted in Figure 6, players are given the opportunity to engage in collaborative\ninteractions with NPCs. In this game, human players’ actions can be obtained from an inverse\ndynamic model by checking preconditions and post-effects. This introduces a unique dynamic to the\ngameplay, enabling users to experience a more immersive cooperative environment. Additionally,\nthe game’s interface is versatile, allowing players multiple ways to interact within the game world.\nThey can either use a standard keyboard setup, which is more conventional and likely familiar to\nmost PC gamers, or they can immerse themselves even further using a Virtual Reality (VR) device.\nThis VR functionality ensures a more tactile and realistic interaction, as players can physically move,\ngesture, and engage with the NPCs and other in-game elements in a 3D environment.\nMulti-agent\nHuman-agent\nVR Interaction\nFigure 6: The top two images show a multi-agent collaboration example in CuisineWorld, the three agents are\npreparing a mixed juice together. The middle two images show a human player as the head chef instructing\nthe agents to cook mixed juice. The bottom two images show a human player collaborating with collaborative\nagents in VR.\n6\nANALYSIS AND EMERGENT GAMING ABILITIES\n6.1\nABLATION STUDY FOR MULTI-AGENTS\nStudy on the Prompt Components Q3. In Table 7, we elucidate the performance of LLM dis-\npatchers with certain components of the prompt omitted. Details about prompt can be found in\nAppendix Figure 9 and Figure 8. Specifically, for these tests, we excluded individual components\nlike inference knowledge, reduced the prompt example to a mere two steps instead of the complete\ndemonstration, and evaluated the model without environment feedback. For context, our principal\nexperiments, varying in the number of agents, incorporate a one-shot example for the correspond-\n12\ning number of agents. Our ablation studies further probe how varying the number of agents can\ninfluence model performance, with details in Table 8.\nFindings: From Table 7, a significant drop in performance is observed when environment feedback\nis excluded, underscoring its pivotal role in the efficacy of the LLM dispatcher. Replaying action\nsequences reveals that, without feedback, the LLM dispatcher tends to repeat mistakes and gets\nstuck in specific states for prolonged durations. Another key takeaway is that a succinct two-step\ndemonstration of input and output format can still achieve commendable performance for unseen\ntasks with dynamic objectives. Notably, in these two-step instances, there’s no explicit guide to finish\nany tasks. Yet, the model doesn’t merely complete the task but continually performs additional tasks\nwithin the same episode. Furthermore, we also observe that integrating human-crafted inference\nknowledge bolsters the LLM dispatcher’s performance. Lastly, even with few-shot demonstrations\ninvolving fewer agents, the LLM dispatcher retains satisfactory performance as shown in Table 8.\nStudy on Other LLMs’ Performance Q4. To study how other LLMs perform on our tasks, we\ntested the collaboration performance of GPT-3.5, Claude-2 and LLaMA in Table 6. For a fair com-\nparison, all tests employed identical prompt inputs.\nFindings: We observe that while other LLMs tend to underperform, models such as Claude-2 still\nmanage to complete the task to a considerable extent.\n6.2\nEMERGING CAPABILITIES\nAcross our experiments, we observe the following emergent properties under our MINDAGENT\nframework.\nEmergent Collaboration Tasks Understanding. As shown in Table 7, especially in the few-step\nablation entries, GPT-4 exhibits its proficiency even when not provided with a full demonstration for\nspecific tasks. To clarify, a ”full few-shot demo” typically refers to a comprehensive demonstration\nof a task, detailing each step and procedure involved. In contrast, we use provide GPT-4 with only a\npartial demonstration or a glimpse of the task only executing two steps.\nYet, despite this limited input, GPT-4’s performance is remarkable. This underscores GPT-4’s im-\npressive emergent zero-shot multi-agent planning capabilities. Beyond simply completing unseen\ntasks, GPT-4 also demonstrates adaptability by dynamically prioritizing multiple different tasks as\nthey arise, emphasizing its emergent multi-task, on-the-fly planning skills.\nEmergent Multi-agent Reasoning Capabilities. Referencing Table 8, GPT-4 has the capability to\ndeploy more agents based on demonstrations of fewer agents. For instance, GPT-4 can effectively\ndispatch four agents having only seen demonstrations involving two agents. Moreover, the efficiency\nof collaboration is higher as the number of agents increases, spotlighting its emergent collaboration\nprowess.\n2 agent\n3 agent\n4 agent\nGPT-4\nClaude-2\nLLaMA\nChatGPT\nGPT-4\nClaude-2\nLLaMA\nChatGPT\nGPT-4\nClaude-2\nLLaMA\nChatGPT\nτint,(1)\n10\/26\n3\/24\n0\n0\/24\n12\/25\n5\/26\n0\n0\/24\n16\/27\n9\/25\n0\n0\/24\nτint,(2)\n10\/17\n3\/16\n0\n0\/15\n14\/20\n4\/16\n0\n0\/15\n16\/19\n4\/15\n0\n0\/15\nτint,(3)\n11\/18\n3\/12\n0\n0\/12\n13\/14\n3\/12\n0\n0\/12\n15\/17\n4\/12\n0\n0\/12\nτint,(4)\n11\/13\n3\/9\n0\n0\/9\n10\/10\n5\/11\n0\n0\/9\n12\/13\n6\/11\n0\n0\/9\nτint,(5)\n11\/11\n4\/6\n0\n0\/6\n12\/12\n5\/7\n0\n0\/6\n12\/12\n6\/7\n0\n0\/6\nCoS\n0.686\n0.3125\n0\n0\n0.822\n0.372\n0\n0\n0.848\n0.473\n0\n0\nTable 6: Performance of Other LLMs on Level 3\n2 agent\nGPT-4\nGPT-4 w\/ few-step\nGPT-4 w\/o inference knowledge\nGPT-4 w\/o feedback\nτint,(1)\n10\/26\n8\/26\n8\/25\n4\/25\nτint,(2)\n10\/17\n11\/19\n9\/17\n4\/17\nτint,(3)\n11\/13\n11\/13\n10\/12\n4\/12\nτint,(4)\n12\/12\n9\/11\n8\/9\n1\/9\nτint,(5)\n11\/11\n10\/10\n9\/9\n5\/7\nCoS\n0.764\n0.710\n0.714\n0.311\nTable 7: Additional Ablation\n13\nlevel 3\n4agent using 4agent module\n4agent using 2agent module\n3agent using 3agent module\n3agent using 2agent module\nGPT4 τint,(1)\n16\/27\n14\/27\n12\/25\n11\/25\nGPT4 τint,(2)\n16\/19\n16\/20\n14\/20\n11\/19\nGPT4 τint,(3)\n15\/17\n15\/16\n13\/14\n12\/14\nGPT4 τint,(4)\n12\/13\n13\/13\n10\/10\n12\/12\nGPT4 τint,(5)\n12\/12\n12\/12\n12\/12\n11\/11\nCoS\n0.848\n0.851\n0.822\n0.775\nTable 8: Using different numbers of agent demos\n7\nNOVEL GAME ADAPTATION\nIn line with our ongoing efforts to create collaborative, in-game, multi-agent systems, we ventured\nbeyond CuisineWorld and made strides in integrating our infrastructure into the widely popular\nsandbox game, Minecraft. In this new adaptation, we designed several unique cooking tasks where\ntwo in-game agents, Alex and Steve, are assigned the responsibility of cooking various types of meat\nas shown in Figure 7. After cooking, agents need to deposit the items into a chest. More details can\nbe found in Appendix C. The experiment results are presented in Table 9.\nWe define the following actions for the multi-agent system in our Minecraft game:\n1)\ngoto(agent, location); 2) killMob(agent, mobType); 3) mineBlock(agent,\nblockType); 4) putFuelFurnace(agent, fuelType), to put the item from agent’s in-\nventory to the furnace’s bottom slot. 5) putItemFurnace(agent, itemType), to put the\nitem from agent’s inventory to the furnace’s top slot; 6) takeOutFurnace(agent), take out the\ncooked item from the furnace 7)\nputInChest(agent, itemType) ;\nThe state space in Minecraft contains the following: 1) nearby blocks for each agent 2) nearby\nentities for each agent. 3) each agent’s inventory 4) items inside the furnace 5) items inside the\nchest. 6) human player’s inventory if a human player is involved.\nTo ensure reproducibility, we modify the game mechanism. A killed mob will respawn nearby, and\na mined block will also respawn nearby.\nThe empirical data we collected from these game sessions provided us with compelling evidence that\nthe multi-agent collaboration infrastructure we’ve developed has the robustness to be extrapolated\nand adapted across multiple distinct games, paving the way for broader applications in the gaming\nindustry.\nGoing a step further, we bridged the gap between human players and in-game (NPC) agents by inte-\ngrating Microsoft’s Azure speech-to-text API into the Minecraft environment. This addition allows\nhuman players to communicate and collaborate with in-game NPC agents using voice chat. Human\nplayers can express their intents and desired goals to NPCs in real-time through voice chat. This\nreal-time vocal interaction enriches the gameplay experience, fostering a deeper level of immersion\nand synergy between human players and AI agents. Moreover, this integration opens the door for\nresearch into the efficacy of voice-assisted AI learning and how real-world human interactions can\nshape AI behavior in virtual domains.\nIn the case of the human player chatting with the multi-agent system, the prompt contains additional\nhuman instructions and human dialog history components.\nIn addition, by integrating Minecraft VR mode with our infrastructure, we can bring the player\ninteractive experiences to the next level.\nGPT-4 minecraft\nτint,(1)\nτint,(2)\nτint,(3)\nτint,(4)\nτint,(5)\nCoS\nPerformance\n0.195\n0.381\n0.704\n0.792\n0.833\n0.581\nTable 9: Performance of our framework in Minecraft\n14\nMulti-agent\nHuman-agent\nVR Interaction\nFigure 7: The top two images show a multi-agent collaboration example in Minecraft.

We investigated the multi-agent planning capabilities of\nMINDAGENT, and we deployed our infrastructure into real-world video games to demonstrate its\neffectiveness for multi-agent collaboration and human-AI collaboration. Beyond its practical appli-\ncations, we hope that our endeavor serves as a beacon, guiding the development of future gaming\nsystems where human-AI collaboration is seamless and intuitive. Furthermore, we are optimistic\nthat our insights and findings might catalyze innovations in crafting games that are not only techno-\nlogically advanced but also significantly more engaging and enjoyable for players.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are especially grateful to Johannes Gehrke, Ryen White, Haiyan Zhang, Kareem Choudhry for\ntheir enormous advice, support and encouragement of the work.

Although they are trained in large text\ncorpora, their superior problem-solving capacity is not limited to canonical language processing\ndomains. LLMs already demonstrate the potential to tackle complex tasks that were previously\npresumed exclusive to domain-specific algorithms or human experts, ranging from mathematical\nreasoning (Imani et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2022) to answering questions of pro-\nfessional law (Blair-Stanek et al., 2023; Choi et al., 2023; Nay, 2022) and medicine (Nov et al.,\n2023; Yang et al., 2023; Jeblick et al., 2022). More recently, some research has shown the possi-\nbility of using LLMs to generate complex plans for robots and game AI (Liang et al., 2022; Wang\net al., 2023b;a; Yao et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023), marking an important milestone for LLMs as\ngeneralist intelligent agents.\nIn this work, we would like to further investigate the planning capacity of LLMs. Specifically, we\nare interested in planning in a multi-agent system (Stone & Veloso, 2000), i.e.multi-agent plan-\nning. Compared to planning for a single agent, which has been extensively studied by previous\nresearch (Wang et al., 2023b;a), multi-agent planning imposes much higher problem-solving com-\nplexity due to the exponentially growing action space (w.r.t. number of agents). The planner has\nto simultaneously control multiple agents, avoid possible conflicts, and coordinate them into com-\npleting a shared goal that requires sophisticated collaborations. To understand to which extent can\nLLMs obtain multi-agent planning skills, we first establish a new benchmark, CUISINEWORLD as\nillustrated in Figure 1.\nTo incorporate agent AI into video games, we main design an infrastructure - MINDAGENT - in-\nspired by multi-agent task allocation optimization theories to facilitate LLM multi-agent planning\ncapabilities. Our infrastructure enables LLMs to perform complex coordination and scheduling\nwith multiple different agents. We conduct comprehensive evaluations with recently introduced\nLLMs playing our game with our infrastructure, including GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA. Through\nthe proposed MINDAGENT interactive multi-agent planning framework for LLMs, we make the fol-\nlowing key observations: 1) zero shot multi-agent planning: Without bells and whistles, powerful\npretrained LLMs like GPT-4 are capable of scheduling multiple agents (ranging from 2 to 4) into\ncompleting dishes, and even collaborate with human players, by merely reading simple game in-\nstructions and recipes; 2) planning with advanced prompting: We are able to significantly boost\ntheir multi-agent planning performances by leveraging the emergent in-context learning capabil-\nity (Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2021): adding very few expert demonstrations even from dif-\nferent game levels to the prompt, explaining the rationale of certain actions as in Chain-of-Thought\nprompting (Wei et al., 2022), and providing on-the-fly feedback to the LLMs during planning; 3)\ngeneralist potentials: LLMs exhibits great potentials of being generalist multi-agent planner as it\nhas strong generalization to coordinate more agents with examples of fewer agents, and adaptation\nto new game domains like Minecraft.\nWhile compared to canonical domain-specific automated planning systems, multi-agent planning\nwith LLMs can still be bottlenecked by challenging computation cost, context length limitation,\nnon-optimal plans, etc., it has the potential of improving from data without fine-tuning (via in-\ncontext learning), seamlessly adapting to planning problems from different domains and offering\nmore flexible interfaces. We hope our findings on LLMs for general-purpose scheduling and coor-\ndination can help shed some light on how such skills can be obtained by learning from large text\ncorpora, and facilitate the emergence of better LLM planners.\nTo summarize, our key contributions are as follows:\n• We establish a new gaming scenario and related benchmark based on a multi-agent virtual kitchen\nenvironment, CUISINEWORLD. It adopts a minimal text-based game format and supports various\nplanning task structures and difficulties, making it an ideal test bed for the emergent multi-agent\nplanning (scheduling and coordination) capacity of LLMs.\n• We introduce MINDAGENT, an infrastructure for interactive multi-agent planning with LLMs,\nwhich demonstrates the in-context learning multi-agent planning capacity of LLMs and brings\nseveral prompting techniques that help facilitate their planning ability, including providing few-\nshot demonstrations, planning rationals, and environmental feedback.\n2\n• We conduct extensive evaluations with multiple LLMs and prompting settings on our benchmark.\nExperimental results confirm their potential on being generalist multi-agent planners in terms of\ngeneralizing to more agents.\n• We deploy our system into real-world gaming scenarios and demonstrate its capabilities in human-\nAI interactions.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nMulti-Agent Coordination. The field of multi-agent collaborations boasts a comprehensive body\nof literature. Traditionally, such collaborations have been modeled using MDP\/POMDP (Lowe et al.,\n2017; Rashid et al., 2020; Jain et al., 2019) frameworks.\nHowever, there has been a recent shift towards utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for these\ncollaborations. For instance, Zhang et al. (2023b) delved into how large language models might\ncommunicate and cooperate in a watch-and-help (WAH) task. Meanwhile, Zhang et al. (2023a)\ninvestigated a two-agent collaboration game inspired by the simpler dynamics of the two-agent\nOvercooked-style game. Notably, their research chiefly concentrated on the task success rate, with\nmost studies typically anchored to a singular task objective. In contrast, we emphasize the impor-\ntance of collaboration efficiency in scenarios encompassing multiple task objectives. Further, our\nresearch uniquely focuses on evaluating the collaborative efficiency of more than two agents. Ad-\nditionally, while other works like Park et al. (2023) simulate each agent individually, we employ a\ncentralized system. This approach not only significantly reduces the number of API calls but also\nreduces context length, making it more appropriate for gaming applications.\nPlanning with LLMs. There exists a number of works that leverage LLMs to perform task planning\n(Huang et al., 2022a; Wang et al., 2023a; Yao et al., 2023). They leverage the LLMs’ internet-scale\ndomain knowledge and emergent zero-shot planning abilities to perform complex task planning and\nreasoning. Recent works in robotics also leverage LLMs to perform task planning, they decompose\na natural language instruction into a sequence of subtasks, either in natural language form or in\npython code (Ahn et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022b; Liang et al., 2022). Then they use a low-level\ncontroller to execute these subtasks. Additionally, (Huang et al., 2022b; Liang et al., 2022; Wang\net al., 2023b) also incorporate environment feedback to improve task performance.\nBenchmarks using Games.\nNumerous games have been developed to study task planning Baker\net al. (2022); Carroll et al. (2019), yet only a handful delve into multi-agent collaborations. Even\nwithin this limited subset, the focus predominantly remains on two-agent interactions where re-\nsponsibilities are not evenly distributed. As evidenced by (Wan et al., 2022; Puig et al., 2020), it’s\ncommon for one player to assume a dominant role while the other provides support. In contrast, our\npaper assumes equal responsibilities across agents, and we expand our investigation to encompass\ncollaborations involving more than just two agents, even with human players. While some previous\nstudies have ventured into multi-task settings, none have delved into scenarios where agents must\ncomplete multiple distinct tasks using competing resources within a single episode. Furthermore,\nour game presents tasks with varied levels of difficulty.\nAdditionally, our work distinguishes itself from Carroll et al. (2019). Contrary to their settings, our\ngame settings feature a diverse array of tools and task objectives, thereby generating an exponentially\nlarger task space. A comparison between our work and other related games is shown in Table 1.\n3\nTHE NEW GAMING CUISINEWORLD DESIGN AND BENCHMARK\nWe introduce CUISINEWORLD as a novel and flexible game for multi-agent scheduling and coor-\ndination in a virtual kitchen environment. In this game, a multi-agent system needs to overlook\nmultiple agents and coordinate them, with the goal of completing as many dish orders as possible.\nIt is equipped with a textual interface since our focus is evaluating LLM-based planning agents.\nOur modularized design separates tasks and game engines, allowing more tasks (type of dishes) and\ndomains (how to implement the “kitchen”: text-based engine, Unity, Minecraft, etc.) to be included.\n3\nBenchmark\nMulti-task\nObject\nInteraction\nTool\nUse\nMaximum\nAgents\nCollabo-\nration\nHuman\nin-the-loop\nProcedural\nLevel Generation\nALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2020)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n1\n✗\n✗\n✗\nWAH (Puig et al., 2020)\n✓\n✓\n✗\n2\n✓\n✓\n✗\nTextWorld (Cˆot´e et al., 2019)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n1\n✗\n✗\n✓\nGenerative Agents (Park et al., 2023)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n25\n✗\n✗\n✓\nEMATP (Liu et al., 2022)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n2\n✓\n✗\n✗\nOvercooked-AI (Carroll et al., 2019)\n✗\n✓\n✓\n2\n✓\n✓\n✗\nHandMeThat (Wan et al., 2022)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n2\n✓\n✗\n✗\nDialFRED (Gao et al., 2022)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n2\n✓∗\n✗\n✗\nTEACH (Padmakumar et al., 2022)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n2\n✓∗\n✗\n✗\nCerealBar (Suhr et al., 2019)\n✗\n✗\n✗\n2\n✓\n✗\n✗\nLIGHT (Urbanek et al., 2019)\n✓\n✗\n✗\n1369\n✗\n✓\n✓\nDiplomacy (Bakhtin et al., 2022)\n✗\n✗\n✗\n7\n✓\n✓\n✗\nCUISINEWORLD (Ours)\n✓\n✓\n✓\n4+\n✓\n✓\n✓\nTable 1: Comparsion between CUISINEWORLD and other related benchmarks.

Note that, although there are multiple agents inside CUISINEWORLD\nthat can be coordinated, as we mentioned above, we adopt a centralized planning scheme and thereby\nformulate our game as a single-agent and fully-observable decision-making problem. An illustration\nof the state & action space and the possible tasks of our game can be found in Figure 1.\nState Space S. In CUISINEWORLD virtual kitchen, there are two types of entity: location and\nagent. For each entity, the game will provide a set of descriptions, the aggregated descriptions\nof all entities will be the state returned by our game. A location can be storage, where you\ncould obtain ingredients and dispense waste, a serving table, where you should put the completed\ndish on, or a cooking tool, e.g. pan, blender. We offer up to two descriptions for each location:\ninside(location, items), indicating what items (some ingredients, completed dishes, etc.)\nare now inside the location; and occupy(location), suggesting location is now being used\n4\nand cannot be touched, e.g. an activated blender. A agent is an entity that can be dispatched\nto complete the task, and we provide up to three descriptions for each agent: at(location,\nagent), indicating now agent is at location; hold(agent, items), suggesting what\nitems agent is holding; and finally occupy(agent), implying agent is now operating a tool,\ne.g. chopping some fruits, and will not respond to any dispatching command.\nAction Space A. An action in CUISINEWORLD is a list of dispatching commands. Given N\nagent entities, a total of N commands need to be generated. The agent provides the follow-\ning commands (also illustrated in Table 2): 1) goto(agent, location), to let agent move\nto location; 2) get(agent, location, item), to let agent get a specific item from\nlocation; 3) put(agent, location), to put whatever agent is holding into location;\n4) activate(agent, location), to let agent turn on location if it is a cooking tool,\ne.g. blender; 5) noop(agent), to have agent perform no actions in this round of dispatching.\nWe will provide more detailed illustrations and rules about the action space in appendix. Note\nthat, to avoid the possible confusion of multiple agents being dispatched to operate with the same\nlocation, the dispatcher also needs to properly order the dispatching commands as they will be\nexecuted sequentially.\nTasks and Reward.\nA task in CUISINEWORLD is a dish order, ranging from the most basic\ntunaSashimi, which can be made by simply chopping some tuna meat, to sophisticated dishes\nlike porkPasta that requires various cooking tools. In a game episode with maximum steps of T,\nevery τint steps (we name this task interval), a new task or dish order will be added to the active task\nlist. A task will be viewed as completed and removed from the active task list when a matched dish\nhas been put on the serving table. On the contrary, a task will be deemed to have failed and removed\nfrom the list when it reaches its lifetime τlft. Lifetime depends on the complexity of the dish and\ndetails can be found in appendix. Along with the tasks, the game provides rewards & penalties or\nfeedback on certain occasions, e.g. when a task is just completed, some infeasible commands are\ndispatched, etc. Due to the space limit, we defer details on tasks to Appendix B..\n3.2\nIMPLEMENTING CUISINEWORLD\nThe implementation of CUISINEWORLD mostly follows the spirit of Overcooked!, a renowned video\ngame. Therefore we refer to many of its game mechanisms while simplifying some of them, e.g. we\nskip low-level control and assume all agent have access to all location at any time (detailed\ncomparisons between CUISINEWORLD and the original video game can be found in appendix).\nSpecifically, we crawled the rules and recipes from the community-contributed wiki1, streamlined\nthem and made necessary modifications, ending up with the basic version of CUISINEWORLD com-\nprising 10 types of location (serving table, storage, and 8 different cooking tools), 27 types of\ningredients, and 33 unique dishes. We group the dishes based on their difficulty to make (primarily\nthe number of cooking tools involved) and design 12 game levels, which are further categorized\ninto 4 classes: entry, simple, intermediate and advanced, with 3 levels each. Note that the recipes,\ndishes, and levels can be easily extended to allow more challenging tasks.\n3.3\nEVALUATION METRIC\nCollaboration Score (CoS). We would like to evaluate to which extent the dispatcher (played by an\nLLM) can coordinate multiple agents into completing dish orders, across different scenarios. Similar\nto the original Overcooked! game, we are particularly interested in this question: Can the dispatcher\nstill coordinate the agents into efficient collaborations with smaller τint, i.e. more dish orders are\nflooding in? Our hypothesis is, an ideal dispatcher should be capable of coordinating agents until\nthere are way more tasks than the system can handle. Therefore, we introduce collaboration score\nCoS, defined as below:\nCoS = 1\nM\nM\nX\ni=1\n#completed task\n\u0002\nτint,(i)\n\u0003\n#completed task\n\u0002\nτint,(i)\n\u0003\n+ #failed task\n\u0002\nτint,(i)\n\u0003,\n(1)\nwhere M is the total amount of τint we evaluate. Effectively, CoS is the average task completion rate\nacross different τint conditions. In our default setting, we use M = 5. While the actual values of τint\n1https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1769729191\n5\nFigure 3: Our overview of our MINDAGENT architecture. Planning Skill & Tool Use: The game environment\nrequires diverse planning skills and tool use to complete tasks. It emits related game information. This module\nalso converts relevant game data into a structured text format so the LLMs can process it. LLM: The main\nworkhorse of our infrastructure makes decisions, which is a dispatcher for the multi-agent system. Memory\nHistory: A storage utility that stores relevant information. Action Module, extract actions from text inputs and\nconvert them into domain-specific language. Validate DSLs so they don’t cause errors when executing.\ndepend on the game level, we ensure they elicit a wide range of difficulty including both extremely\nrelaxed and intense scenarios.\nIn a word, CuisineWorld is a game that emulates a virtual kitchen, where several robots are com-\nmanded to use various cooking tools and ingredients to prepare as many dish orders as possible in a\nlimited period of time. To facilitate collaboration, new orders will keep flooding in while the exist-\ning ones should be completed before expiration. Therefore, LLMs need to properly coordinate these\nrobots to maximize overall productivity. CUISINEWORLD also offers game levels with a wide range\nof planning difficulty: dishes with different complexity (number of ingredients and tools involved),\nnumber of agents, order frequency and lifetime, etc, making it an ideal test bed for LLM-based\nmulti-agent planning.\n4\nMINDAGENT: INFRASTRUCTURE FOR GAMING AI\n4.1\nINFRASTRUCTURE\nOur first foray into the challenging CUISINEWORLD benchmark is an interactive multi-agent plan-\nning framework for LLMs: MINDAGENT It adopts a minimalist design for the purpose of demon-\nstrating the emergent capacity of LLMs in scheduling and coordination, while also bringing in ex-\nploratory prompting techniques that facilitate better planning and shed some light on future ap-\nproaches. Our infrastructure follows in-context learning. We will outline the key techniques below:\nTo facilitate in-context learning, our MINDAGENT infrastructure is composed of three primary com-\nponents: the prompt, current state, and memory.\nWithin the prompt component, there are four distinct sub-components: recipes, general instructions,\ninference knowledge, and a one-shot demo.\nRecipes. outline the hierarchical procedure for preparing various dishes at the given level. They\nspecify the necessary ingredients for each intermediate or final product, the appropriate tools re-\nquired, and the expected outcome post-cooking.\n6\nInstructions. detail the foundational rules of CUISINEWORLD. These instructions delineate the\narray of actions agents can undertake within the game and enumerate the characteristics of every tool\navailable in the current kitchen scenario. Moreover, they inform agents about the base ingredients\nretrievable from storage, as well as all potential intermediate products they can procure. Agents are\nalso explicitly advised to remain cautious about feedback from the environment.\nInference Knowledge. houses insights and helpful hints for the agent. When utilized appropriately,\nthese hints can guide agents to sidestep potential errors and enhance their collaborative efficiency.\nOne-shot Demo. presents a step-by-step demonstration of the preparation of a distinct dish, differ-\nent from other dishes at the current level. This demonstration spans several time steps, each of which\nis incorporated as part of the prompt. The demonstration illustrates the major procedures for cook-\ning one dish in CUISINEWORLD, including obtaining ingredients, putting ingredients into different\ntools, transporting intermediate ingredients, and delivering the final dish to the serving table.\nCurrent State. provides a snapshot of the prevailing observations from the environment. It en-\ncompasses information such as the agents’ locations, the objects currently in the agents’ possession,\nthe tools that are accessible within the environment, the ingredients present within each tool, and\nthe tools that are actively in use. Moreover, it includes optional feedback from the environment,\ntriggered when the agents’ actions contravene the environment rules— for instance, when assigning\ntwo distinct actions to the same agent.\nMemory History. archives the interaction history with the environment. Specifically, it chronicles\nthe state of the environment and the state of the agents at every time step.\nIn addition to the prompt modules, additional modules are implemented to help interface between\nLLMs and CUISINEWORLD.\nAction Extraction. employs a regular expression matching procedure to distill agent actions from\nthe LLM’s textual output. This module is indispensable because, on occasion, the LLM’s output is\nnot clean. The output contains information reflecting its internal thought processes. At times, the\nLLM might even issue apologies for prior missteps in reaction to environment feedback.\nAction Validation. utilizes a look-ahead checking mechanism. This module parses the proposed\nactions, assessing their feasibility. Should an action be deemed inexecutable, an error message is\npromptly returned.\n4.2\nINFRASTRUCTURE MECHANISM\nAssuming a multi-agent system with a total of N agents, the system must complete a sequence of P\ndifferent tasks. Each task has Mp different sub-tasks. Furthermore, the number and types of tasks\nare unknown at the beginning of the episode. The environment will sample a task for the agents to\nfinish for a given interval. Then the agents need to complete the designated task along with other\ntasks in the task queue. In addition, each task has an expiration time. After the expiration time, the\ntask will be marked as a failure. The objective of the multi-agent system is to finish as many tasks\nas possible and fail as fewer tasks as possible within a given time frame.\nWe aim to find valid and optimal task planning, scheduling, and allocations. We define qpim and\ncpim as quality and cost, respectively, for allocating agent i to work on the sub-task m for the p th\ntask in the episode. Then the combined utility for the sub-task is:\nupim =\n\u001aqpim −cpim,\nif agent i can execute sub-task m for the p th task in the episode\n−∞.\notherwise\nWe define the assignment of sub-task m to agent i as\nvpim =\n\u001a1,\nagent i is assigned to sub-task m for the p th task in the episode\n0.\notherwise\nThe goal is to maximize the utility of the episode under a time constraint. Define the execution\ntime for task m by agent i for the p th task in the episode as τpim, and the maximum time allowed\nto execute the task as Tmax, we can express the task decomposition and assignment problem as\nfollows:\n7\narg max\nv\nP\nX\np=1\nN\nX\ni=1\nMp\nX\nm=1\nupimvpim\n(2)\nSubject to:\nP\np\nP\ni\nP\nm τpimvpim\n≤Tmax\nP\ni vpim\n≤1\n∀m ∈M, ∀p ∈P\nvpim\n∈{0, 1}\n∀i ∈N, ∀m ∈M, ∀p ∈P\nAs pointed out by (Korsah et al., 2013), this problem cannot be solved in polynomial time. In this\nwork, we tackle this problem by using large-language models.\nOur prompt design choices try to help LLM system solve Equation 2. In practice, we reformu-\nlate Equation 2 with qualities or rewards expressed in natural languages as environment feedback.\nFor example, when the agent successfully collects an item, the environment emits a signal “collect\nfinish.” When the dispatcher assigns a different task to the same agent, the environment will emit a\nsignal “agent ids cannot be the same.” As rewards are not immediately observable, we borrow sprites\nfrom temporal difference learning. We accumulate state-action history into memory history. Due\nto context length limits, it’s infeasible to fit the entire history into the context window. We select a\nfixed horizon history as a part of the prompt to guide the model performance. We further express\nthe constraints of the system in natural language formats and repeat important constraints multiple\ntimes if necessary.\n5\nEXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS\nOverview. We conduct extensive experiments in CUISINEWORLD. We first introduce the exper-\niment settings and present an analysis of empirical results in CUISINEWORLD. Our experiments\nfocus on addressing the following research questions:\nQ1: How efficiently can the model dispatch multiple agents?\nQ2: Can the model dispatch agents for dynamic, on-the-fly goals across different tasks?\nQ3: How do various components of the input prompt influence the model’s performance?\nQ4: How do other LLMs perform compared to GPT-4?\nQ5: To what extent can the existing methods collaborate with human users?\nQ6: What’s the human perception of collaborating with numerous intelligent agents?\n5.1\nLLM SETTINGS\nWe perform experiments on CUISINEWORLD through OpenAI APIs and anthropic APIs. All GPT-\n4 experiments are using gpt-4-0613 model, and all chat-GPT experiments are using gpt-3.5-turbo-\n0613. For Llama 2 experiments, we use hugging face inference endpoints Llama-2-70b-chat-hf. We\nset the temperature for all experiments to 0.1 following (Wang et al., 2023a). We report the average\nresults over three episodes.\n5.2\nEXPERIMENT SETTING I: LLMS DISPATCH MULTI-AGENTS (NPC)\nCollaboration Efficiency (Q1, Q2). Figure 4 and Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5 reports the system\nperformance under different settings. In particular, Table 3 reports the multi-agent collaboration\nresults among two agents. Table 4 reports the multi-agent collaboration results among three agents,\nand Table 5 reports the multi-agent collaboration results among four agents. Figure 4 displays the\ncollaboration efficiency curve.\nAs shown in Figure 4, across different task levels, more agents generally lead to better collaboration\nefficiencies. As the collaboration efficiency curve is generally higher with more agents.\nComputing CoS by levels also reveals that more agents will lead to better collaboration efficiencies.\nAs shown in the tables, the CoS score is the highest when there are two agents in two cases.

The CoS score is the highest\nwhen there are four agents in three cases. The results also confirm that more agents will lead to\nhigher collaboration efficiencies.\nFindings. First, we observe that the system performance is generally better when there are more\nagents, indicating that LLM dispatcher can coordinate more agents to execute tasks more efficiently.\nSecond, we observe that the system performance degrades with more agents in less demanding\nconditions, indicating that LLM dispatcher struggles when there are fewer tasks.\n5.3\nEXPERIMENT SETTING II: HUMAN AND MULTI-NPCS WITH LLMS\n5.3.1\nHUMAN DATA COLLECTION\nHuman Testing of Study Protocol. Before starting the experiment, a webpage introduction to\nthe game is handed to the players. It contains rules and the basic controls of the game. Then we\nrandomly assign the playing order. Participants can drop out of the testing at any time as they wise;\nin that case, their data will be discarded. The human evaluation interface is shown in Appendix D.\nMeasurement. In the background, we collect the number of failed and successful tasks during the\nparticipant’s interaction with the game system. In addition, we record the entire action history of\nplayers and intelligent agents. Therefore, we can replay action histories for further analysis. After\neach episode, the participants must complete a survey about their engagement with the system on a\n5-point likert chart.\nOur objective measure is intended to evaluate the human AI teaming performance, and the subjective\nmeasure is designed to evaluate users’ perceptions of the system.\n5.3.2\nEXPERIMENT II SETTING\nWe conducted a user study in our gaming environment that tries to answer Q5, Q6.\n9\n2-agent\nvery simple\nsimple\nintermediate\nadvanced\nAvg.\nlevel 0\nlevel 1\nlevel 7\nlevel 2\nlevel 4\nlevel 8\nlevel 3\nlevel 9\nlevel 10\nlevel 5\nlevel 11\nlevel 12\nGPT4 τint,(1)\n18\/54\n18\/56\n12\/31\n14\/34\n12\/30\n3\/30\n10\/26\n7\/20\n7\/23\n6\/23\n6\/21\n10\/36\n0.318\nGPT4 τint,(2)\n18\/31\n17\/34\n10\/23\n13\/26\n12\/22\n9\/22\n10\/17\n8\/11\n6\/12\n5\/13\n4\/14\n8\/21\n0.486\nGPT4 τint,(3)\n18\/25\n19\/25\n10\/17\n16\/18\n11\/18\n6\/16\n11\/13\n6\/8\n7\/10\n8\/10\n9\/9\n8\/17\n0.709\nGPT4 τint,(4)\n18\/18\n18\/19\n12\/12\n11\/14\n11\/12\n7\/11\n12\/12\n8\/8\n9\/9\n6\/7\n8\/9\n11\/12\n0.912\nGPT4 τint,(5)\n18\/18\n17\/17\n12\/12\n11\/13\n11\/13\n9\/9\n11\/11\n4\/5\n7\/7\n8\/8\n8\/8\n9\/12\n0.937\nCoS\n0.727\n0.706\n0.682\n0.687\n0.664\n0.504\n0.764\n0.725\n0.701\n0.661\n0.692\n0.559\n0.673\nTable 3: 2 agents performance on different tasks\n3-agent\nvery simple\nsimple\nintermediate\nadvanced\nAverage\nlevel 0\nlevel 1\nlevel 7\nlevel 2\nlevel 4\nlevel 8\nlevel 3\nlevel 9\nlevel 10\nlevel 5\nlevel 11\nlevel 12\nGPT4 τint,(1)\n21\/55\n24\/55\n16\/33\n17\/33\n9\/28\n6\/32\n12\/25\n5\/20\n8\/21\n7\/22\n7\/22\n9\/26\n0.368\nGPT4 τint,(2)\n20\/31\n25\/33\n11\/22\n4\/24\n13\/24\n7\/21\n14\/20\n9\/12\n9\/13\n7\/14\n8\/14\n10\/23\n0.549\nGPT4 τint,(3)\n22\/25\n21\/26\n17\/17\n11\/20\n9\/17\n4\/15\n13\/14\n8\/8\n12\/12\n7\/7\n9\/10\n10\/16\n0.791\nGPT4 τint,(4)\n22\/22\n20\/21\n14\/14\n9\/13\n7\/10\n6\/10\n10\/10\n6\/7\n10\/10\n5\/8\n7\/8\n11\/13\n0.846\nGPT4 τint,(5)\n20\/20\n15\/16\n11\/12\n10\/14\n10\/11\n8\/9\n12\/12\n6\/6\n8\/8\n5\/5\n8\/8\n6\/10\n0.914\nCoS\n0.781\n0.778\n0.780\n0.528\n0.600\n0.455\n0.822\n0.771\n0.815\n0.689\n0.733\n0.570\n0.694\nTable 4: 3 agents performance on different tasks\n4-agent\nvery simple\nsimple\nintermediate\nadvanced\nAverage\nlevel 0\nlevel 1\nlevel 7\nlevel 2\nlevel 4\nlevel 8\nlevel 3\nlevel 9\nlevel 10\nlevel 5\nlevel 11\nlevel 12\nGPT4 τint,(1)\n22\/54\n18\/55\n17\/34\n13\/34\n8\/28\n9\/33\n16\/27\n5\/20\n8\/23\n5\/22\n8\/22\n8\/35\n0.349\nGPT4 τint,(2)\n24\/32\n21\/33\n14\/24\n14\/25\n12\/24\n11\/22\n16\/19\n7\/12\n9\/15\n7\/14\n6\/12\n12\/23\n0.590\nGPT4 τint,(3)\n23\/25\n23\/26\n13\/18\n11\/19\n10\/17\n11\/17\n15\/17\n8\/9\n11\/11\n7\/8\n10\/11\n9\/17\n0.785\nGPT4 τint,(4)\n22\/22\n21\/22\n14\/14\n7\/15\n10\/13\n10\/12\n12\/13\n9\/9\n10\/10\n6\/7\n8\/8\n9\/13\n0.875\nGPT4 τint,(5)\n14\/18\n20\/20\n14\/14\n7\/13\n9\/11\n7\/8\n12\/12\n5\/5\n7\/7\n6\/6\n3\/5\n7\/10\n0.859\nCoS\n0.771\n0.761\n0.761\n0.505\n0.592\n0.626\n0.848\n0.744\n0.790\n0.692\n0.675\n0.534\n0.692\nTable 5: 4 agents performance on different tasks\nThe user study evaluates the LLM dispatcher’s capabilities of collaborating with humans, where\nparticipants are collaborating with 1,2,3 agents or working alone on the virtual cooking tasks. We\nconsider the most general setting, where the LLM works on the unseen task, level 3.\n5.3.3\nEXPERIMENT II DESIGN\nHypotheses. The user study tests the following hypotheses:\n• H1: Task productivity. Participants have higher productivity if collaborating with AI agents.\n• H2: Task productivity with more agents. Participants have higher productivity if collaborating\nwith more AI agents.\n• H3: Perception of the robot. Participants would have higher perceived task efficiency and have\nmore fun playing the game due to collaboration.\nManipulated Variables. We use a within-subject design for our experiment. In particular, every\nuser tries to finish the task by himself or collaborates with different numbers of robots with varying\ndegrees of competency. We randomize the order of the treatment to mitigate practice effects, fatigue\neffects, and carryover effects.\n• Single agent: Participants work on the task by themselves.\n• LLM powered multi-agent system: Participants collaborate with the multi-agent system pow-\nered by LLM.\n• Random agent: Random agents execute random actions from a pool of valid actions. Participants\ncollaborate with random agents.\nMain Results. We recruited 12 subjects for our study. Among them, there are two females and 10\nmales.\nWe use ANOVA to test the effects of different experimental conditions on collaboration performance\nand subjective perception of the AI agents. Tukey HSD tests are conducted on all possible pairs of\nexperimental conditions.\n10\n(a) Collaboration score We can\ntell that the collaboration score is\nhigher if more agents are collab-\norating with human players, even\nthough the difference is not signif-\nicant.\n(b) Perceived Enjoyment Humans\nenjoy the game more if they col-\nlaborate with the right number of\nagents\n(c) Perceived more fun due to col-\nlaboration. Players enjoy the game\nmore because of collaborating with\ncompetent agents.\n(d) Perceived Assisting. There is\nno significant difference in terms\nof human perceptions of helpful-\nness when collaborating with more\nagents, even though the task suc-\ncess rate is higher.\n(e)\nPerceived\ndependability.\nWhen collaborating with more\nagents,\nplayers depend on the\nagents more.\n(f) Perceived Predictability. There\nis no difference in terms of the\npredictability\nof\nagents’\nbehav-\niors when collaborating with more\nagents.\n(g) Perceived productivity. Play-\ners think collaborating with AI\nagents will improve productivity.\n(h) Perceived Trust. There is no\ndifference in terms of trust when\ncollaborating with more agents.\nFigure 5: Human Evaluations\nFindings. We find significant effects on team collaboration success rate F(4, 55) = 28.11, p <\n0.001. Post-hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD tests revealed that the team of the player with\nLLM agents achieves a higher success rate than a human working alone, p < 0.001 across different\nnumbers of agents, confirming H1. Even though the success rate is generally higher when collab-\norating with more agents, there is no significant effect compared with collaborating with one agent,\ncollaborating with two agents p = 0.774, or collaborating with three agents p = 0.231. We observe\nthat human players have more fun playing the game when collaborating with LLM-powered intel-\nligent agents than playing alone, p = 0.0126. Players feel that collaboration with intelligent agents\nleads to higher productivity, p = 0.0104, thus confirming H3.\nIn addition, when playing with intelligent agents, human players will take their actions based on\nother players’ actions p = 0.00266. Human players also found that intelligent agents are more\npredictable compared with random agents p < 0.001.\nFurther insights from player feedback highlighted an intriguing trade-off: while more agents im-\nproved overall task success rates, it reduced the game’s enjoyment. Often, players felt sidelined and\nless involved. Thus, game developers should adjust AI performance to maintain player engagement\n11\nand fun. As indicated by Yuan et al. (2022), aligning human values with AIs might be a promising\nway to solve this problem.\n5.4\nVISUALING ”CUISINEWORLD”\nTo implement CUISINEWORLD into a real game system, we built on top of Gao et al. (2020). In our\ngame, as visually depicted in Figure 6, players are given the opportunity to engage in collaborative\ninteractions with NPCs. In this game, human players’ actions can be obtained from an inverse\ndynamic model by checking preconditions and post-effects. This introduces a unique dynamic to the\ngameplay, enabling users to experience a more immersive cooperative environment. Additionally,\nthe game’s interface is versatile, allowing players multiple ways to interact within the game world.\nThey can either use a standard keyboard setup, which is more conventional and likely familiar to\nmost PC gamers, or they can immerse themselves even further using a Virtual Reality (VR) device.\nThis VR functionality ensures a more tactile and realistic interaction, as players can physically move,\ngesture, and engage with the NPCs and other in-game elements in a 3D environment.\nMulti-agent\nHuman-agent\nVR Interaction\nFigure 6: The top two images show a multi-agent collaboration example in CuisineWorld, the three agents are\npreparing a mixed juice together. The middle two images show a human player as the head chef instructing\nthe agents to cook mixed juice. The bottom two images show a human player collaborating with collaborative\nagents in VR.\n6\nANALYSIS AND EMERGENT GAMING ABILITIES\n6.1\nABLATION STUDY FOR MULTI-AGENTS\nStudy on the Prompt Components Q3. In Table 7, we elucidate the performance of LLM dis-\npatchers with certain components of the prompt omitted. Details about prompt can be found in\nAppendix Figure 9 and Figure 8. Specifically, for these tests, we excluded individual components\nlike inference knowledge, reduced the prompt example to a mere two steps instead of the complete\ndemonstration, and evaluated the model without environment feedback. For context, our principal\nexperiments, varying in the number of agents, incorporate a one-shot example for the correspond-\n12\ning number of agents. Our ablation studies further probe how varying the number of agents can\ninfluence model performance, with details in Table 8.\nFindings: From Table 7, a significant drop in performance is observed when environment feedback\nis excluded, underscoring its pivotal role in the efficacy of the LLM dispatcher. Replaying action\nsequences reveals that, without feedback, the LLM dispatcher tends to repeat mistakes and gets\nstuck in specific states for prolonged durations. Another key takeaway is that a succinct two-step\ndemonstration of input and output format can still achieve commendable performance for unseen\ntasks with dynamic objectives. Notably, in these two-step instances, there’s no explicit guide to finish\nany tasks. Yet, the model doesn’t merely complete the task but continually performs additional tasks\nwithin the same episode. Furthermore, we also observe that integrating human-crafted inference\nknowledge bolsters the LLM dispatcher’s performance. Lastly, even with few-shot demonstrations\ninvolving fewer agents, the LLM dispatcher retains satisfactory performance as shown in Table 8.\nStudy on Other LLMs’ Performance Q4. To study how other LLMs perform on our tasks, we\ntested the collaboration performance of GPT-3.5, Claude-2 and LLaMA in Table 6. For a fair com-\nparison, all tests employed identical prompt inputs.\nFindings: We observe that while other LLMs tend to underperform, models such as Claude-2 still\nmanage to complete the task to a considerable extent.\n6.2\nEMERGING CAPABILITIES\nAcross our experiments, we observe the following emergent properties under our MINDAGENT\nframework.\nEmergent Collaboration Tasks Understanding. As shown in Table 7, especially in the few-step\nablation entries, GPT-4 exhibits its proficiency even when not provided with a full demonstration for\nspecific tasks. To clarify, a ”full few-shot demo” typically refers to a comprehensive demonstration\nof a task, detailing each step and procedure involved. In contrast, we use provide GPT-4 with only a\npartial demonstration or a glimpse of the task only executing two steps.\nYet, despite this limited input, GPT-4’s performance is remarkable. This underscores GPT-4’s im-\npressive emergent zero-shot multi-agent planning capabilities. Beyond simply completing unseen\ntasks, GPT-4 also demonstrates adaptability by dynamically prioritizing multiple different tasks as\nthey arise, emphasizing its emergent multi-task, on-the-fly planning skills.\nEmergent Multi-agent Reasoning Capabilities. Referencing Table 8, GPT-4 has the capability to\ndeploy more agents based on demonstrations of fewer agents. For instance, GPT-4 can effectively\ndispatch four agents having only seen demonstrations involving two agents. Moreover, the efficiency\nof collaboration is higher as the number of agents increases, spotlighting its emergent collaboration\nprowess.\n2 agent\n3 agent\n4 agent\nGPT-4\nClaude-2\nLLaMA\nChatGPT\nGPT-4\nClaude-2\nLLaMA\nChatGPT\nGPT-4\nClaude-2\nLLaMA\nChatGPT\nτint,(1)\n10\/26\n3\/24\n0\n0\/24\n12\/25\n5\/26\n0\n0\/24\n16\/27\n9\/25\n0\n0\/24\nτint,(2)\n10\/17\n3\/16\n0\n0\/15\n14\/20\n4\/16\n0\n0\/15\n16\/19\n4\/15\n0\n0\/15\nτint,(3)\n11\/18\n3\/12\n0\n0\/12\n13\/14\n3\/12\n0\n0\/12\n15\/17\n4\/12\n0\n0\/12\nτint,(4)\n11\/13\n3\/9\n0\n0\/9\n10\/10\n5\/11\n0\n0\/9\n12\/13\n6\/11\n0\n0\/9\nτint,(5)\n11\/11\n4\/6\n0\n0\/6\n12\/12\n5\/7\n0\n0\/6\n12\/12\n6\/7\n0\n0\/6\nCoS\n0.686\n0.3125\n0\n0\n0.822\n0.372\n0\n0\n0.848\n0.473\n0\n0\nTable 6: Performance of Other LLMs on Level 3\n2 agent\nGPT-4\nGPT-4 w\/ few-step\nGPT-4 w\/o inference knowledge\nGPT-4 w\/o feedback\nτint,(1)\n10\/26\n8\/26\n8\/25\n4\/25\nτint,(2)\n10\/17\n11\/19\n9\/17\n4\/17\nτint,(3)\n11\/13\n11\/13\n10\/12\n4\/12\nτint,(4)\n12\/12\n9\/11\n8\/9\n1\/9\nτint,(5)\n11\/11\n10\/10\n9\/9\n5\/7\nCoS\n0.764\n0.710\n0.714\n0.311\nTable 7: Additional Ablation\n13\nlevel 3\n4agent using 4agent module\n4agent using 2agent module\n3agent using 3agent module\n3agent using 2agent module\nGPT4 τint,(1)\n16\/27\n14\/27\n12\/25\n11\/25\nGPT4 τint,(2)\n16\/19\n16\/20\n14\/20\n11\/19\nGPT4 τint,(3)\n15\/17\n15\/16\n13\/14\n12\/14\nGPT4 τint,(4)\n12\/13\n13\/13\n10\/10\n12\/12\nGPT4 τint,(5)\n12\/12\n12\/12\n12\/12\n11\/11\nCoS\n0.848\n0.851\n0.822\n0.775\nTable 8: Using different numbers of agent demos\n7\nNOVEL GAME ADAPTATION\nIn line with our ongoing efforts to create collaborative, in-game, multi-agent systems, we ventured\nbeyond CuisineWorld and made strides in integrating our infrastructure into the widely popular\nsandbox game, Minecraft. In this new adaptation, we designed several unique cooking tasks where\ntwo in-game agents, Alex and Steve, are assigned the responsibility of cooking various types of meat\nas shown in Figure 7. After cooking, agents need to deposit the items into a chest. More details can\nbe found in Appendix C. The experiment results are presented in Table 9.\nWe define the following actions for the multi-agent system in our Minecraft game:\n1)\ngoto(agent, location); 2) killMob(agent, mobType); 3) mineBlock(agent,\nblockType); 4) putFuelFurnace(agent, fuelType), to put the item from agent’s in-\nventory to the furnace’s bottom slot. 5) putItemFurnace(agent, itemType), to put the\nitem from agent’s inventory to the furnace’s top slot; 6) takeOutFurnace(agent), take out the\ncooked item from the furnace 7)\nputInChest(agent, itemType) ;\nThe state space in Minecraft contains the following: 1) nearby blocks for each agent 2) nearby\nentities for each agent. 3) each agent’s inventory 4) items inside the furnace 5) items inside the\nchest. 6) human player’s inventory if a human player is involved.\nTo ensure reproducibility, we modify the game mechanism. A killed mob will respawn nearby, and\na mined block will also respawn nearby.\nThe empirical data we collected from these game sessions provided us with compelling evidence that\nthe multi-agent collaboration infrastructure we’ve developed has the robustness to be extrapolated\nand adapted across multiple distinct games, paving the way for broader applications in the gaming\nindustry.\nGoing a step further, we bridged the gap between human players and in-game (NPC) agents by inte-\ngrating Microsoft’s Azure speech-to-text API into the Minecraft environment. This addition allows\nhuman players to communicate and collaborate with in-game NPC agents using voice chat. Human\nplayers can express their intents and desired goals to NPCs in real-time through voice chat. This\nreal-time vocal interaction enriches the gameplay experience, fostering a deeper level of immersion\nand synergy between human players and AI agents. Moreover, this integration opens the door for\nresearch into the efficacy of voice-assisted AI learning and how real-world human interactions can\nshape AI behavior in virtual domains.\nIn the case of the human player chatting with the multi-agent system, the prompt contains additional\nhuman instructions and human dialog history components.\nIn addition, by integrating Minecraft VR mode with our infrastructure, we can bring the player\ninteractive experiences to the next level.\nGPT-4 minecraft\nτint,(1)\nτint,(2)\nτint,(3)\nτint,(4)\nτint,(5)\nCoS\nPerformance\n0.195\n0.381\n0.704\n0.792\n0.833\n0.581\nTable 9: Performance of our framework in Minecraft\n14\nMulti-agent\nHuman-agent\nVR Interaction\nFigure 7: The top two images show a multi-agent collaboration example in Minecraft.

We investigated the multi-agent planning capabilities of\nMINDAGENT, and we deployed our infrastructure into real-world video games to demonstrate its\neffectiveness for multi-agent collaboration and human-AI collaboration. Beyond its practical appli-\ncations, we hope that our endeavor serves as a beacon, guiding the development of future gaming\nsystems where human-AI collaboration is seamless and intuitive. Furthermore, we are optimistic\nthat our insights and findings might catalyze innovations in crafting games that are not only techno-\nlogically advanced but also significantly more engaging and enjoyable for players.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are especially grateful to Johannes Gehrke, Ryen White, Haiyan Zhang, Kareem Choudhry for\ntheir enormous advice, support and encouragement of the work.

Recently,\nsigniﬁcant progress has been made in developing solutions to embodied AI problems such as (visual)\nnavigation [1–5], interactive Q&A [6–10], instruction following [11–15], and manipulation [16–22].\nTo calibrate the progress, several lines of pioneering efforts have been made towards benchmarking\nembodied AI in simulated environments, including Rearrangement [23, 24], TDW Transport Chal-\nlenge [25], VirtualHome [26], ALFRED [11], Interactive Gibson Benchmark [27], MetaWorld [28],\nand RLBench [29], among others [30–32]). These efforts are inspiring, but their activities represent\nonly a fraction of challenges that humans face in their daily lives. To develop artiﬁcial agents that can\neventually perform and assist with everyday activities with human-level robustness and ﬂexibility, we\nneed a comprehensive benchmark with activities that are more realistic, diverse, and complex.\nBut this is easier said than done. There are three major challenges that have prevented existing\nbenchmarks to accommodate more realistic, diverse, and complex activities:\n• Deﬁnition: Identifying and deﬁning meaningful activities for benchmarking;\n• Realization: Developing simulated environments that realistically support such activities;\n• Evaluation: Deﬁning success and objective metrics for evaluating performance.\n∗indicates equal contribution\ncorrespondence to {sanjana2,chengshu}@stanford.edu\narXiv:2108.03332v1  [cs.RO]  6 Aug 2021\n(:goal\n  (forAll (book? – BOOK)\n    (InsideOf book? shelf1) \n  )\n)\nActivity-Relevant Objects\n(:init\n  (OnTop book1 table1)\n  (OnTop book2 table1)\n  (OnTop book3 chair1) \n)\nActivity Initial Condition\nActivity Goal Condition\niGibson 2.0 Scene Dataset\nBDDL Definitions\nValid Activity Instances\nInHand(book1)\n…\nExecution in VR or \nby an AI Agent\nInsideOf(book1, shelf1)\n…\nBEHAVIOR VR Demos\ntime\na\nb\nc\nd\nEvaluation\n• Success\n• Efficiency\nBEHAVIOR Activities\n…\nassembling gift baskets\nre-shelving library books\ncleaning bathroom\npreserving food\n…\nBEHAVIOR Objects\nFigure 1: Benchmarking Embodied AI with BEHAVIOR: a⃝We deﬁne 100 realistic household activities from\nthe American Time Use Survey [33] and deﬁne them with a set of relevant objects, organized with WordNet [34],\nand logic-symbolic initial and goal conditions in BDDL (Sec. 4).\nb⃝We provide an implementation of\nBEHAVIOR in iGibson 2.0 that generates potentially inﬁnite diverse activity instances in realistic home scenes\nusing the deﬁnition. c⃝AI agents perform the activities in simulation through continuous physical interactions of\nan embodied avatar with the environment. Humans can perform the same activities in VR. BEHAVIOR includes\na dataset of 500 successful VR demonstrations. d⃝Changes in the scene are continuously mapped to their logic-\nsymbolic equivalent representation in BDDL and checked against the goal condition; we provide intermediate\nsuccess scores, metrics on agent’s efﬁciency, and a human-centric metric relative to the demonstrations.\nWe propose BEHAVIOR (Fig. 1)–Benchmark for Everyday Household Activities in Virtual,\nInteractive, and ecOlogical enviRonments, addressing the three key challenges aforementioned\nwith three technical innovations. First, we introduce BEHAVIOR Domain Deﬁnition Language\n(BDDL), a representation adapted from predicate logic that maps simulated states to semantic sym-\nbols. It allows us to deﬁne 100 activities as initial and goal conditions, and further enables generation\nof potentially inﬁnite initial states and solutions for achieving the goal states. Second, we facilitate its\nrealization by listing environment-agnostic functional requirements for realistic simulation. With\nproper engineering, BEHAVIOR can be implemented in many existing environments; we provide\na fully functional instantiation in iGibson 2.0 in this paper including the necessary object models\n(1217 models of 391 categories). Third, we provide a comprehensive set of metrics to evaluate\nagent performance in terms of success and efﬁciency. To make evaluation comparable across diverse\nactivities, scenes, and instances, we propose a set of metrics relative to demonstrated human per-\nformance on each activity, and provide a large-scale dataset of 500 human demonstrations (758.5\nmin) in virtual reality, which serve as ground truth for evaluation and may also facilitate developing\nimitation learning solutions.\nBEHAVIOR activities are realistic, diverse, and complex. They comprise of 100 activities often\nperformed by humans in their homes (e.g., cleaning, packing or preparing food) and require long-\nhorizon solutions for changing not only the position of multiple objects but also their internal states\nor texture (e.g., temperature, wetness or cleanliness levels). As we demonstrate by experimentally\nevaluating the performance of two state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms (Section 7), these\nproperties make BEHAVIOR activities extremely challenging for existing solutions. By presenting\nwell-deﬁned challenges beyond the capabilities of current solutions, BEHAVIOR can serve as a\nunifying benchmark that guides the development of embodied AI.\n2\nRelated Work\nBenchmarks and datasets have played a critical role in recent impressive advances in AI, particularly\ncomputer vision. Image [35–38] and video datasets [39–44] enable study and development of\nsolutions for important research questions by providing both training data and fair comparison.\nThese datasets, however, are passive observations, and therefore not well suited for development of\nembodied AI that must control and understand the consequences of their own actions.\nBenchmarks for Embodied AI:\nAlthough real-world challenges [45–52] provide the ultimate\ntestbed for embodied AI agents, benchmarks in simulated environments serve as useful alternatives\nwith several advantages; simulation enables faster, safer learning, and supports more reproducible,\naccessible, and fair evaluation. However, in order to serve as a meaningful proxy for real-world\n2\nBEHAVIOR\nAI2THOR Vis.

The activity set is diverse in topic, objects used, scenes done in, and state\nchanges required. The diversity is reinforced by the ability to generate inﬁnite new instances scene-agnostically.\nBEHAVIOR activities are complex enough to reﬂect real-world housework: many decision steps and objects in\neach activity. This makes BEHAVIOR uniquely well-suited to benchmark task-planning and control, and it is\nthe only one to include human VR demonstrations (see Table A.1 for more detail).\nperformance, simulation benchmarks need to achieve high levels of 1) realism (in the activities,\nthe models, the sensing and actuation of the agent), 2) diversity (of scenes, objects and activities\nbenchmarked), and 3) complexity (length, number of objects, required skills and state changes).\nBelow we review existing benchmarks based on these three criteria (see Table 1 for a summary).\nBenchmarks for visual navigation [53, 54] provide high levels of visual realism and diversity of scenes,\nbut they often lack interactivity or diversity of activities. The Interactive Gibson Benchmark [27]\ntrades off some visual realism for physically realistic object manipulation in order to benchmark\ninteractive visual navigation. While benchmarks for stationary manipulation [55, 29, 28, 30, 56,\n31, 32] fare well on physical realism, they commonly fall short on diversity (of scenes, objects,\ntasks) and complexity (e.g., simple activities that take a few seconds). Benchmarks for instruction\nfollowing [11, 26] provide diversity of scenes, objects and possible changes of the environment, but\nwith low level of complexity; the horizon of the activities is shorter as the agents decide among a\ndiscrete set of predeﬁned action primitives with full access to the state of the world.\nCloser to BEHAVIOR, a recent group of benchmarks has focused on rearrangement tasks [23–25] in\nrealistic simulation environments with diverse scenes. The initial Rearrangement position paper [23]\nposes critical questions such as how to deﬁne embodied AI tasks and measure solution quality.\nImportantly, however, most household activities go far beyond the scope of rearrangement (see\ncomparison in Fig. A.2). While such focus can inspire new solutions for solving rearrangement\ntasks, these solutions may not generalize to activities that require more than physical manipulation of\nobject coordinates. Indeed, the majority of household activities involve other state changes (cooking,\nwashing, etc. (Fig. A.2, [33]). BEHAVIOR therefore incorporates 100 activities that humans actually\nspend time on at home [33] (Sec. 3). To express such diverse activities in a common language, we\npresent a novel logic-symbolic representation that deﬁnes activities in terms of initial and goal states,\ninspired by but distinct from the Planning Domain Deﬁnition Language [57]. These yield in principle\ninﬁnite instances per activity and accept any meaningful solution. We implement activity-independent\nmetrics including a human-centric metric normalized to human performance; to facilitate comparison\nand development of new solutions, we also present a dataset of 500 successful VR demonstrations.\n3\nBEHAVIOR: Benchmarking Realistic, Diverse, Complex Activities\nBuilding on the advances led by existing benchmarks, BEHAVIOR aims to reach new levels of\nrealism, diversity, and complexity by using household activities as a domain for benchmarking AI.\nSee Table 1 for comparisons between BEHAVIOR and existing benchmarks.\n3\nRealism in BEHAVIOR Activities:\nTo effectively benchmark embodied AI agents in simulation,\nwe need realistic activities that pose similar challenges to those in the real world. BEHAVIOR achieves\nthis by using a data-driven approach to identify activities that approximate the true distribution of real\nhousehold activities. To this end, we use the American Time Use Survey (ATUS, [33]): A survey\nfrom the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on how Americans spend their time. BEHAVIOR activities\ncome from, and are distributed similarly to, the full space of simulatable activities in ATUS (see\nFig. A.2). The use of an independently curated source of real-world activities is a unique strength of\nBEHAVIOR as a benchmark that reﬂects natural behaviors of a large population.\nBEHAVIOR also achieves realism by simulating these activities in reconstructions of real-world\nhomes. We use iGibson 2.0, a simulation environment with realistic physics simulation from the\nBullet [58] physics engine and high-quality virtual sensor signals (see Fig. A.7), which includes 15\necological, fully interactive 3D models of real-world homes with furniture layouts that approximate\ntheir real counterparts. These scenes are further populated with object models created by professional\nartists from the new BEHAVIOR Object dataset, which includes 1217 models of 391 categories\ngrounded in the WordNet [34] taxonomy. The dataset covers a data-driven selection of activity-related\nobjects (see Fig. A.8). Figs. A.10 and A.9 illustrate examples of objects and taxonomic arrangement.\nThe 100 BEHAVIOR activities, visualized in Fig. A.1, go beyond comparable benchmarks that\nevaluate a few hand-picked activities in less realistic setups (see Table 1 Realism).\nDiversity in BEHAVIOR Activities:\nBenchmarks with diverse activities demand generalizable\nsolutions. In real-world homes, agents encounter a range of activities that differ in 1) the capabilities\nrequired for achieving them, 2) the environments in which they occur (e.g., scenes, objects), and 3)\nthe initial states of a particular scene. BEHAVIOR presents extensive diversity in all these dimensions.\nWe include 100 activities that require a wide variety of state changes (e.g., moving objects, soaking\nmaterials, cleaning surfaces, heating\/freezing food) demanding a broad set of agent capabilities\n(see Fig A.2). To reﬂect the diversity in the ways humans encounter, understand, and accomplish\nthese activities, we provide two example deﬁnitions per activity. BDDL, our novel representation\nfor activity deﬁnition, allows new valid instances to be sampled from each deﬁnition, providing\npotentially inﬁnite number of instances per activity. The resulting instances vary over scene, object\nmodels, and conﬁguration, supported by implementation in iGibson 2.0 and BEHAVIOR Object\ndataset. Related benchmarks focus on fewer tasks, mostly limited to kinematic state changes and\nwith scene- or position-constant instantiation (see Table 1 Diversity).\nComplexity in BEHAVIOR Activities:\nBeyond diversity across activities, BEHAVIOR also raises\nthe complexity of the activities themselves by benchmarking full household activities that parallel the\nlength (number of steps an agent needs), the number of objects involved, and the number of required\ncapabilities of real-world chores (see Fig. A.3, comparison in Table 1 Complexity). Compared to\nactivities in existing benchmarks, these activities are very long-horizon with some requiring several\nthousand steps (even for humans in VR; see Fig. A.12), involve more objects (avg. 10.5), and require\na heterogeneous set of capabilities (range: 2 - 8) to change various environment states.\n4\nDeﬁning Realistic, Diverse, and Complex Household Activities with BDDL\nBEHAVIOR challenges embodied AI agents to achieve a diverse set of complex long-horizon\nhousehold activities through physical interactions in a realistically simulated home environment.\nAdopting the common formalism of partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDP), each\nactivity is represented by the tuple M = (S, A, O, T , R, γ). Here, S is the state space; A is the\naction space; O is the observation space; T (s′|s, a), s ∈S, a ∈A, is the state transition model;\nR(s, a) ∈R is the reward function; γ is the discount factor. Based on a full representation of the\nphysical state, S, the simulation environment generates realistic transitions to embodied AI agents’\nactions, a ∈A, i.e., physical interactions, and close-to-real observations, o ∈O, e.g., virtual images.\nWe deﬁne an activity τ as two sets of states, τ = {Sτ,0, Sτ,g}, where Sτ,0 is a set of possible initial\nstates and Sτ,g is a set of acceptable goal states. In an activity instance, the agent must change the\nworld state from some concrete s0 ∈Sτ,0 to any sg ∈Sτ,g. However, describing activities in the\nphysical state space generates scene- or pose-speciﬁc deﬁnitions (e.g., [23, 30, 29]) that are far more\nspeciﬁc than how humans represent these activities, limiting the diversity and complexity of existing\nembodied AI benchmarks. To overcome this, we introduce BEHAVIOR Domain Deﬁnition Language\n4\nBurnt(ﬁsh)\nCooked(ﬁsh)\nFrozen(ﬁsh)\nSliced(tomato)\nOpen(microwave)\nDusty(table)\nStained(plate)\nSoaked(rag)\nToggledOn(stove)\nInRoom(bed, bedroom)\nOnFloor(shoe)\nOnTopOf(apple, plate)\nInsideOf(food, fridge)\nUnder(present, tree)\nNextTo(book, bag)\nFigure 2: Unary and Binary Predicates in BDDL: We represent object states and relationships to other objects\nbased on their kinematics, temperature, wetness level and other physical and functional properties, enabling a\ndiverse and complex set of realistic activities\n(BDDL), a predicate logic-based language that establishes a symbolic state representation built on\npredeﬁned, meaningful predicates grounded in simulated physical states; its variables and constants\nrepresent object categories from the BEHAVIOR object dataset. Each activity is deﬁned in BDDL as\nan initial and goal condition parametrizing sets of possible initial states and satisfactory goal states\n¯Sτ,0 and ¯Sτ,g. BDDL predicates create symbolic counterparts of the physical state, ¯S (see Fig. 2).\nBDDL overcomes limitations that hinder diversity through two mechanisms: ﬁrst, an initial condition\nmaps to inﬁnite physical states in diverse scenes. Second, a goal condition detects all semantically\nsatisfactory solutions, rather than limiting to a few or only those that obey semantically uninterest-\ning geometric constraints (see Fig. A.6 for examples). This state-based deﬁnition is also entirely\ndeclarative, providing a true benchmark of planning ability. By comparison, other benchmarks are\nlimited to scene- or pose-speciﬁc instantiation and solution acceptance, and\/or have imperative plans.\nBEHAVIOR includes a systematic generation pipeline (see A.3.3) allowing unlimited deﬁnitions\nper activity and formalizing the inherent subjectivity and situationality of household activities. We\ninclude 200 deﬁnitions and 300 activity instances in simulation (see Sec. 5). BEHAVIOR is thus the\nonly benchmark equipped to formalize unlimited human-deﬁned versions of an activity and create\npractically inﬁnite unique instantiations in any scene.\n5\nInstantiating BEHAVIOR in a Realistic Physics Simulator\nWhile BEHAVIOR is not bounded to any speciﬁc simulation environment, there are a set of functional\nrequirements that are necessary to simulate BEHAVIOR activities: 1) maintain an object-centric\nrepresentation (object identities enriched with properties and states), 2) simulate physical forces and\nmotion, and generate virtual sensor signals (images), 3) simulate additional, non-kinematic properties\nper object (e.g. temperature, wetness level, cleanliness level), 4) implement functionality to generate\nvalid instances based on the literals deﬁning an activity’s initial condition, e.g., instantiating an object\ninsideOf another, and 5) implement functionality to evaluate the atomic formulae relevant to the\ngoal condition, e.g. checking whether an object is cooked or onTopOf another.\nAdditionally, the simulator must provide an interface of the action space A and the observation\nspace O of the underlying POMDP to embodied AI agents (Sec. 4). While BEHAVIOR activities\nare not tailored to a speciﬁc embodiment, we propose two concrete bodies to fulﬁll the activities\n(see Fig. 1): a bimanual humanoid avatar (24 degrees of freedom, DoF), and a Fetch robot (12\/13\nDoF), both capable of navigating, grasping and interacting with the hand(s). Humans in VR embody\nthe bimanual humanoid. Agents trained with the Fetch embodiment could be directly tested with\na real-world version of the hardware (see discussion on sim2real in Sec. A.8). Both embodiments\nreceive sensor signals from the on-board virtual sensors, and perform actions at 30 Hz.\nWe provide a fully functional implementation of BEHAVIOR using iGibson 2.0, a new version\nof the open-source simulation environment iGibson that fulﬁlls the requirements above. iGibson\n5\nFigure 3: Evaluation of human performance in collect_misplaced_items: (Left) success score, Q;\n(Right) efﬁciency metrics: kinematic disarrangement, (Dk, dotted), hand interaction displacement (Lright, green,\nand Lleft, blue); frames at the top depict signiﬁcant events detected by the metrics; the success score detects the\ncompletion of activity-relevant steps; exploration, manipulation and scene disruption events are captured by the\nefﬁciency metrics that provide complementary information about the performance of the agent\n2.0 provides an object-centric representation with additional properties, support for sources of heat\nand water, dust and stain particles, and changes in object appearance based on extended states.\nWe implement the two embodiments in iGibson 2.0: the agent receives proprioceptive information\nand has access to iGibson 2.0’s generated realistic signals: RGB, depth images, LiDAR, normals,\nﬂow (optical, spatial), and semantic and instance segmentation. While this control and sensing\nsetup is standard in BEHAVIOR, we additionally implement a set of action primitives inspired\nby [25, 54, 59, 24] to facilitate solution prototyping and task-planning research. The primitives\nexecute sequences of low-level actions resulting from a motion planning process (bilateral RRT∗[60])\nto navigateTo, grasp, placeOnTop, placeInside, open, and close the target object provided\nas arguments. Even though the agent only relies on sensory observations to decide on action primitive,\nthe primitives themselves internally assume access to privileged information (e.g. object identities,\nposes, and geometric shapes for planning). Further details can be found in Sec. A.4 and in the\ncross-submission included in appendix. Our implementation of BEHAVIOR in iGibson 2.0 goes\nbeyond the capabilities of existing benchmarks and ampliﬁes realism, diversity, and complexity.\n6\nEvaluation Metrics: Success, Efﬁciency and Human-Centric Metric\nBEHAVIOR provides evaluation metrics to quantify the performance of an embodied AI solution.\nExtending prior metrics suggested for Rearrangement [23], we propose a primary metric based on\nsuccess and several secondary metrics for characterizing efﬁciency.\nPrimary Metric – Success Score Q:\nThe main goal of an embodied AI agent in BEHAVIOR is\nto perform an activity successfully (i.e., all logical expressions in the goal condition are met). A\nbinary deﬁnition of success, however, only signals the end of a successful execution and cannot assess\ninterim progress. To provide more guidance to agents and enable comparisons of partial solutions,\nwe propose success score as the primary metric, deﬁned as the maximum fraction of satisﬁed goal\nliterals in a ground solution to the goal condition at each step. More formally:\nGiven an activity τ with goal state set ¯Sτ,g, its goal condition can be ﬂattened to a set C of conjunctions\nCi of ground literals lji. For any Ci ∈C, if all lji ∈Ci are true then the goal condition is satisﬁed\n(see A.3.2 for deﬁnitions and technical details on ﬂattening), i.e. for some current environment state\ns, we have W\nCi\nV\nlji\nlji = True =⇒s ∈¯Sτ,g . We compute the fraction of literals lji that are True\nfor each Ci, and deﬁne the overall success score by taking the maximum: Q = max\nC\n|{lji |lji =True}|\n|Ci|\n,\nwhere | · | is set cardinality.\nAn activity is complete when all literals in at least one Ci of its goal condition are satisﬁed, achieving\nQ = 1 (100%). Fig. 3 left depicts time evolution of Q during an activity execution. Q extends the\nfraction of objects in acceptable poses proposed as metric in [23], generalized to any type of activity.\nSecondary Metrics – Efﬁciency:\nBeyond success, efﬁciency is critical to evaluation; a successful\nsolution in real-world tasks may be ineffective if it takes too long or causes scene disruption. We\npropose six secondary metrics that complement the primary metric (see Fig. 3, right, for examples):\n6\n• Simulated time, Tsim: Accumulated time in simulation during execution as the number of\nsimulated steps times the average simulated time per step. Tsim is independent of the computer used.\n• Kinematic disarrangement, DK: Displacement caused by the agent in the environment. This can\nbe accumulated over time, or differential, i.e. computed between two time steps, e.g. initial, ﬁnal.\n• Logical disarrangement, DL: Amount of changes caused by the agent in the logical state of the\nenvironment. This can be accumulated over time or differential between two time steps.\n• Distance navigated, Lbody: Accumulated distance traveled by the agent’s base body. This metric\nevaluates the efﬁciency of the agent in navigating the environment.\n• Displacement of hands, Lleft and Lright: Accumulated displacement of each of the agent’s hands\nwhile in contact with another object for manipulation (i.e., grasping, pushing, etc). This metric\nevaluates the efﬁciency of the agent in its interaction with the environment.\nThese efﬁciency metrics above can be quantiﬁed in absolute units (e.g., distance, time) for scene- and\nactivity-speciﬁc comparisons (general efﬁciency). To enable fair comparisons cross diverse activities\nin BEHAVIOR, we also propose normalization relative to human performance (human-centric\nefﬁciency); given a human demonstration for an activity instance in VR, each secondary metric can\nbe expressed as a fraction of the maximum human performance on that metric.\nFor this purpose, we present the BEHAVIOR Dataset of Human Demonstrations with 500 successful\ndemonstrations of BEHAVIOR activities in VR (758.5 min). Humans are immersed in iGibson 2.0,\ncontrolling the same embodiment used by the AI agents (details in Sec. A.6). The dataset includes\na complete record of human actions including manipulation, navigation, and gaze tracking data\n(Fig. A.12, Fig. A.14, and Fig. A.16), supporting analysis and subactivity segmentation (Fig. A.11).\nSec. A.6.2 presents a comprehensive analysis of these data; we quantify human performance in\nBEHAVIOR efﬁciency metrics (see Fig. A.12), and Fig. A.13 provides a further decomposition of\nroom occupancy and hand usage across each BEHAVIOR activity. To our knowledge, this is the\nlargest available dataset of human behavior in VR; these data can facilitate development of new\nsolutions for embodied AI (e.g., imitation learning) and also support studies of human cognition,\nplanning, and motor control in ecological environments.\n7\nEvaluating Reinforcement Learning in BEHAVIOR\nIn this section, we aim to experimentally demonstrate the challenges imposed by BEHAVIOR’s\nrealism, diversity, and complexity by evaluating the performance of some current state-of-the-art\nembodied AI solutions. While BEHAVIOR is a benchmark for all kinds of embodied AI methods,\nhere we evaluate two reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that have demonstrated excellent results\nin simpler embodied AI tasks with continuous or discrete action spaces [61, 62, 21, 63–67]: Soft-\nActor Critic (SAC [16]) and Proximal-Policy Optimization (PPO [17]). We use SAC to train policies\nin the original low-level continuous action space of the agent, and PPO for experiments using our\nimplemented action primitives (for details on the agents, see Sec. 5). Due to limited computational\nresources, we run our evaluation on the 12 most simple activities (based on involved types of state\nchanges) until convergence. Reward is given by our staggered success score Q. We use as input to\nthe policies a subset of the realistic agent’s observations, RGB, depth and proprioception (excluding\nLiDAR, segmentation, etc.). Sec. A.7 includes more experimental details.\nResults in the original activities:\nThe ﬁrst row of Table 2 shows the results of SAC (mean Q at\nthe end of training for 3 seeds) on the original 12 activities with the standard setup: realistic robot\nactions and onboard sensing. Even for these “simpler” activities, BEHAVIOR is too great a challenge:\nthe training agents do not fulﬁll any predicate in the goal condition (Q = 0). In the following, we will\nanalyze how each dimension of difﬁculty (realism, diversity, complexity) contributes to these results.\nEffect of complexity (activity length):\nIn the ﬁrst experiment, we evaluate the impact of the\nactivity complexity (time length) in robot learning performance. First, we evaluate the performance\nof an RL algorithm using our implemented action primitives based on motion planning. These are\ntemporally extended actions that effectively shorten the horizon and length of the activity. The\nresults of training with PPO are depicted in the second row of Table 2. Even in these simpler\nconditions, agents fail in all but one activity (bringingInWood, Q = 0.13). In a second oracle-\ndriven experiment, we take a successful human demonstration for each activity from the BEHAVIOR\nDataset and save the state of the environment a few seconds before its successful execution at T. We\n7\nuse this as initial state and train agents with SAC: rows 3 to 6 of Table 2 show the mean success rate\n(SR, full accomplishment of the activity) in 100 evaluation episodes for the ﬁnal policy resulting\nfrom training with three different random seeds (Q starts here close to 1 and is less informative).\nEven when starting 1 s away from a goal state, most learning agents fail to achieve the tasks. A\nfew achieve better success but their performance decreases quickly as we start further away from\nthe successful execution, being zero for all activities at 10 s. This indicates that the long-horizon\nof the activities in BEHAVIOR is in fact a paramount challenge for reinforcement learning. We\nhypothesize that Embodied AI solutions with a hierarchical structure such as hierarchical-RL or\ntask-and-motion-planning (TAMP) may help to overcome the challenges of high complexity (length)\nof the BEHAVIOR activities [68–71].\nbringingInWood\ncollectMisplacedItems\nmovingBoxesToStorage\norganizingFileCabinet\nthrowingAwayLeftovers\nputtingDishesAway\nputtingleftoversAway\nre-shelvingLibraryBooks\nlayingTileFloors\nsettingUpCandles\npickingUpTrash\nstoringFood\nQca\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\ncomplexity\nQap\n0.13\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nSRca@T −1 s\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0.97\n1\nSRca@T −2 s\n1\n0.07\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0.01\n0\nSRca@T −3 s\n1\n0.21\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0.01\n0\n0\nSRca@T −10 s\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nrealism\nQca\nFullObs\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nQap\nFullObs\n0.20\n0.02\n0.49\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.13\n0\n0.09\n0\n0\nQap\nNoPhys\n0.92\n0.47\n0.73\n0\n0.32\n0.55\n0.44\n0.04\n0\n0.27\n0\n0.32\nQap\nNoPhys,FullObs\n1.0\n0.95\n0.83\n0\n0.56\n0.94\n0.55\n0.56\n0\n0.5\n0.67\n1.0\nTable 2: Evaluation of state-of-the-art RL algorithms on BE-\nHAVIOR Fully realistic, diverse and complex (row 1): SAC [16]\nfor visuomotor continuous actions (superindex ca) performs poorly\nin all activities; Complexity analysis (rows 2-6): reducing complex-\nity (horizon) with temporally extended action primitives (superindex\nap and gray cells, trained with PPO [17]) or by starting few seconds\naway from a goal state, lead to some non-zero success rate (SR).\nRealism analysis (rows 7-10): Only by reducing realism in obser-\nvations and physics, and complexity through action primitives, RL\nachieves signiﬁcant success in a handful of the activities.\nEffect of realism (in sensing and ac-\ntuation):\nIn a third experiment, we\nevaluate how much the realism in ac-\ntuation and sensing affects the perfor-\nmance of embodied AI solutions. To\nevaluate the effect of realistic observ-\nability of the BEHAVIOR activities in\nthe performance of robot learning ap-\nproaches, we train agents with contin-\nuous motion control (SAC), and mo-\ntion primitives (PPO) assuming full-\nobservability of the state. Tables 2\n(rows 7-8, subindex FullObs) depict\nthe results. We observe that even with\nfull observability the complexity dom-\ninates policies in the original action\nspace and they do not accomplish any\npart of the activities. For policies selecting among action primitives, there is some partial success only\nin ﬁve of the activities indicating that the perceptual problem is part of the difﬁculty in BEHAVIOR.\nTo evaluate the effect of realistic actuation, we train an agent using action primitives that execute\nwithout physics simulation, achieving their expected outcome (e.g. grasp an object, or place it some-\nwhere). Tables 2 (row 9-10, subindex noPhys) shows the results, also in combination with unrealistic\nfull-observability. We observe that without the difﬁculties of realistic physics and actuation, the\nlearning agents achieve an important part of most activities, accomplishing consistently two of them\n(Q = 1) when full-observability of the state is also granted. This indicates that the generation of the\ncorrect actuation is a critical challenge for embodied AI solutions, even when they infer the right next\nstep at the task-planning level, supporting the importance of benchmarks with realistically action\nexecution over predeﬁned action outcomes.\nDiversity in. ..\nobject poses\nobject instances\nontop\nsliced\nsoaked\nstained\ncooked\né\né\n1\n0.15\n1\n1\n1\nË\né\n0.825\n0\n0.935\n0.28\n0.66\nË\nË\n0.46\n0\n0.925\n0.11\n0.265\nTable 3: Evaluation of the effect of BEHAVIOR’s diversity: Re-\nsults of training agents with SAC [16] in single-predicate activities\nof increasing diversity; Even in these simple activities, performance\ndegrades quickly indicating that current state-of-the-art cannot cope\nwith the dimensions of diversity spanned in BEHAVIOR\nEffect\nof\ndiversity\n(in\nactivity\ninstance\nand\nobjects):\nAnother\ncause of the poor performance of\nrobot learning solutions in the 12 BE-\nHAVIOR activities may be the high\ndiversity in multiple dimensions, such\nas scenes, objects, and initial states.\nThis diversity forces embodied AI so-\nlutions to generalize to all possible\nconditions. In a second experiment,\nwe evaluate the effect of BEHAVIOR’s diversity on performance. To present diversity across activi-\nties while alleviating their complexity, we train RL agents to complete ﬁve single-literal activities\ninvolving only one or two objects. Note that these activities are not part of BEHAVIOR. We evaluate\ntraining with RL (SAC) for each activity under diverse instantiations: initialization of the activity\n(object poses) and object instances. The results are shown in Table 3, where we report Q. First,\nwe train without any diversity as baseline to understand the ground complexity of the single-literal\nactivities. All agents achieve success. Then, we evaluate how well the RL policies train for a diverse\nset of instances of the activities, ﬁrst changing objects’ initial pose, then changing the object. Per-\nformance in all activities decreases rapidly, especially in sliced and stained. These experiments\n8\nindicate that the diversity in BEHAVIOR goes beyond what current RL algorithms can handle even\nin simpliﬁed activities, and poses a challenge for generalization in embodied AI.\n8\nConclusion and Future Work\nWe presented BEHAVIOR, a novel benchmark for embodied AI solutions of household activities.\nBEHAVIOR presents 100 realistic, diverse and complex activities with a new logic-symbolic represen-\ntation, a fully functional simulation-based implementation, and a set of human-centric metrics based\non the performance of humans on the same activities in VR. The activities push the state-of-the-art\nin benchmarking adding new types of state changes that the agent needs to be able to cause, such\nas cleaning surfaces or changing object temperatures. Our experiments with two state-of-the-art RL\nbaselines shed light on the challenges presented by BEHAVIOR’s level of realism, diversity and\ncomplexity. BEHAVIOR will be open-source and free to use; we hope it facilitates participation and\nfair access to research tools, and paves the way towards a new generation of embodied AI.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Bokui Shen, Xi Jia Zhou, and Jim Fan for comments, ideas, and support in data\ncollection.

Recently,\nsigniﬁcant progress has been made in developing solutions to embodied AI problems such as (visual)\nnavigation [1–5], interactive Q&A [6–10], instruction following [11–15], and manipulation [16–22].\nTo calibrate the progress, several lines of pioneering efforts have been made towards benchmarking\nembodied AI in simulated environments, including Rearrangement [23, 24], TDW Transport Chal-\nlenge [25], VirtualHome [26], ALFRED [11], Interactive Gibson Benchmark [27], MetaWorld [28],\nand RLBench [29], among others [30–32]). These efforts are inspiring, but their activities represent\nonly a fraction of challenges that humans face in their daily lives. To develop artiﬁcial agents that can\neventually perform and assist with everyday activities with human-level robustness and ﬂexibility, we\nneed a comprehensive benchmark with activities that are more realistic, diverse, and complex.\nBut this is easier said than done. There are three major challenges that have prevented existing\nbenchmarks to accommodate more realistic, diverse, and complex activities:\n• Deﬁnition: Identifying and deﬁning meaningful activities for benchmarking;\n• Realization: Developing simulated environments that realistically support such activities;\n• Evaluation: Deﬁning success and objective metrics for evaluating performance.\n∗indicates equal contribution\ncorrespondence to {sanjana2,chengshu}@stanford.edu\narXiv:2108.03332v1  [cs.RO]  6 Aug 2021\n(:goal\n  (forAll (book? – BOOK)\n    (InsideOf book? shelf1) \n  )\n)\nActivity-Relevant Objects\n(:init\n  (OnTop book1 table1)\n  (OnTop book2 table1)\n  (OnTop book3 chair1) \n)\nActivity Initial Condition\nActivity Goal Condition\niGibson 2.0 Scene Dataset\nBDDL Definitions\nValid Activity Instances\nInHand(book1)\n…\nExecution in VR or \nby an AI Agent\nInsideOf(book1, shelf1)\n…\nBEHAVIOR VR Demos\ntime\na\nb\nc\nd\nEvaluation\n• Success\n• Efficiency\nBEHAVIOR Activities\n…\nassembling gift baskets\nre-shelving library books\ncleaning bathroom\npreserving food\n…\nBEHAVIOR Objects\nFigure 1: Benchmarking Embodied AI with BEHAVIOR: a⃝We deﬁne 100 realistic household activities from\nthe American Time Use Survey [33] and deﬁne them with a set of relevant objects, organized with WordNet [34],\nand logic-symbolic initial and goal conditions in BDDL (Sec. 4).\nb⃝We provide an implementation of\nBEHAVIOR in iGibson 2.0 that generates potentially inﬁnite diverse activity instances in realistic home scenes\nusing the deﬁnition. c⃝AI agents perform the activities in simulation through continuous physical interactions of\nan embodied avatar with the environment.

BEHAVIOR includes\na dataset of 500 successful VR demonstrations. d⃝Changes in the scene are continuously mapped to their logic-\nsymbolic equivalent representation in BDDL and checked against the goal condition; we provide intermediate\nsuccess scores, metrics on agent’s efﬁciency, and a human-centric metric relative to the demonstrations.\nWe propose BEHAVIOR (Fig. 1)–Benchmark for Everyday Household Activities in Virtual,\nInteractive, and ecOlogical enviRonments, addressing the three key challenges aforementioned\nwith three technical innovations. First, we introduce BEHAVIOR Domain Deﬁnition Language\n(BDDL), a representation adapted from predicate logic that maps simulated states to semantic sym-\nbols. It allows us to deﬁne 100 activities as initial and goal conditions, and further enables generation\nof potentially inﬁnite initial states and solutions for achieving the goal states. Second, we facilitate its\nrealization by listing environment-agnostic functional requirements for realistic simulation. With\nproper engineering, BEHAVIOR can be implemented in many existing environments; we provide\na fully functional instantiation in iGibson 2.0 in this paper including the necessary object models\n(1217 models of 391 categories). Third, we provide a comprehensive set of metrics to evaluate\nagent performance in terms of success and efﬁciency. To make evaluation comparable across diverse\nactivities, scenes, and instances, we propose a set of metrics relative to demonstrated human per-\nformance on each activity, and provide a large-scale dataset of 500 human demonstrations (758.5\nmin) in virtual reality, which serve as ground truth for evaluation and may also facilitate developing\nimitation learning solutions.\nBEHAVIOR activities are realistic, diverse, and complex. They comprise of 100 activities often\nperformed by humans in their homes (e.g., cleaning, packing or preparing food) and require long-\nhorizon solutions for changing not only the position of multiple objects but also their internal states\nor texture (e.g., temperature, wetness or cleanliness levels). As we demonstrate by experimentally\nevaluating the performance of two state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms (Section 7), these\nproperties make BEHAVIOR activities extremely challenging for existing solutions. By presenting\nwell-deﬁned challenges beyond the capabilities of current solutions, BEHAVIOR can serve as a\nunifying benchmark that guides the development of embodied AI.\n2\nRelated Work\nBenchmarks and datasets have played a critical role in recent impressive advances in AI, particularly\ncomputer vision. Image [35–38] and video datasets [39–44] enable study and development of\nsolutions for important research questions by providing both training data and fair comparison.\nThese datasets, however, are passive observations, and therefore not well suited for development of\nembodied AI that must control and understand the consequences of their own actions.\nBenchmarks for Embodied AI:\nAlthough real-world challenges [45–52] provide the ultimate\ntestbed for embodied AI agents, benchmarks in simulated environments serve as useful alternatives\nwith several advantages; simulation enables faster, safer learning, and supports more reproducible,\naccessible, and fair evaluation.

The activity set is diverse in topic, objects used, scenes done in, and state\nchanges required. The diversity is reinforced by the ability to generate inﬁnite new instances scene-agnostically.\nBEHAVIOR activities are complex enough to reﬂect real-world housework: many decision steps and objects in\neach activity. This makes BEHAVIOR uniquely well-suited to benchmark task-planning and control, and it is\nthe only one to include human VR demonstrations (see Table A.1 for more detail).\nperformance, simulation benchmarks need to achieve high levels of 1) realism (in the activities,\nthe models, the sensing and actuation of the agent), 2) diversity (of scenes, objects and activities\nbenchmarked), and 3) complexity (length, number of objects, required skills and state changes).\nBelow we review existing benchmarks based on these three criteria (see Table 1 for a summary).\nBenchmarks for visual navigation [53, 54] provide high levels of visual realism and diversity of scenes,\nbut they often lack interactivity or diversity of activities. The Interactive Gibson Benchmark [27]\ntrades off some visual realism for physically realistic object manipulation in order to benchmark\ninteractive visual navigation. While benchmarks for stationary manipulation [55, 29, 28, 30, 56,\n31, 32] fare well on physical realism, they commonly fall short on diversity (of scenes, objects,\ntasks) and complexity (e.g., simple activities that take a few seconds). Benchmarks for instruction\nfollowing [11, 26] provide diversity of scenes, objects and possible changes of the environment, but\nwith low level of complexity; the horizon of the activities is shorter as the agents decide among a\ndiscrete set of predeﬁned action primitives with full access to the state of the world.\nCloser to BEHAVIOR, a recent group of benchmarks has focused on rearrangement tasks [23–25] in\nrealistic simulation environments with diverse scenes. The initial Rearrangement position paper [23]\nposes critical questions such as how to deﬁne embodied AI tasks and measure solution quality.\nImportantly, however, most household activities go far beyond the scope of rearrangement (see\ncomparison in Fig. A.2). While such focus can inspire new solutions for solving rearrangement\ntasks, these solutions may not generalize to activities that require more than physical manipulation of\nobject coordinates. Indeed, the majority of household activities involve other state changes (cooking,\nwashing, etc. (Fig. A.2, [33]). BEHAVIOR therefore incorporates 100 activities that humans actually\nspend time on at home [33] (Sec. 3). To express such diverse activities in a common language, we\npresent a novel logic-symbolic representation that deﬁnes activities in terms of initial and goal states,\ninspired by but distinct from the Planning Domain Deﬁnition Language [57]. These yield in principle\ninﬁnite instances per activity and accept any meaningful solution. We implement activity-independent\nmetrics including a human-centric metric normalized to human performance; to facilitate comparison\nand development of new solutions, we also present a dataset of 500 successful VR demonstrations.\n3\nBEHAVIOR: Benchmarking Realistic, Diverse, Complex Activities\nBuilding on the advances led by existing benchmarks, BEHAVIOR aims to reach new levels of\nrealism, diversity, and complexity by using household activities as a domain for benchmarking AI.\nSee Table 1 for comparisons between BEHAVIOR and existing benchmarks.\n3\nRealism in BEHAVIOR Activities:\nTo effectively benchmark embodied AI agents in simulation,\nwe need realistic activities that pose similar challenges to those in the real world. BEHAVIOR achieves\nthis by using a data-driven approach to identify activities that approximate the true distribution of real\nhousehold activities. To this end, we use the American Time Use Survey (ATUS, [33]): A survey\nfrom the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on how Americans spend their time. BEHAVIOR activities\ncome from, and are distributed similarly to, the full space of simulatable activities in ATUS (see\nFig. A.2). The use of an independently curated source of real-world activities is a unique strength of\nBEHAVIOR as a benchmark that reﬂects natural behaviors of a large population.\nBEHAVIOR also achieves realism by simulating these activities in reconstructions of real-world\nhomes. We use iGibson 2.0, a simulation environment with realistic physics simulation from the\nBullet [58] physics engine and high-quality virtual sensor signals (see Fig. A.7), which includes 15\necological, fully interactive 3D models of real-world homes with furniture layouts that approximate\ntheir real counterparts. These scenes are further populated with object models created by professional\nartists from the new BEHAVIOR Object dataset, which includes 1217 models of 391 categories\ngrounded in the WordNet [34] taxonomy. The dataset covers a data-driven selection of activity-related\nobjects (see Fig. A.8). Figs. A.10 and A.9 illustrate examples of objects and taxonomic arrangement.\nThe 100 BEHAVIOR activities, visualized in Fig. A.1, go beyond comparable benchmarks that\nevaluate a few hand-picked activities in less realistic setups (see Table 1 Realism).\nDiversity in BEHAVIOR Activities:\nBenchmarks with diverse activities demand generalizable\nsolutions. In real-world homes, agents encounter a range of activities that differ in 1) the capabilities\nrequired for achieving them, 2) the environments in which they occur (e.g., scenes, objects), and 3)\nthe initial states of a particular scene. BEHAVIOR presents extensive diversity in all these dimensions.\nWe include 100 activities that require a wide variety of state changes (e.g., moving objects, soaking\nmaterials, cleaning surfaces, heating\/freezing food) demanding a broad set of agent capabilities\n(see Fig A.2). To reﬂect the diversity in the ways humans encounter, understand, and accomplish\nthese activities, we provide two example deﬁnitions per activity. BDDL, our novel representation\nfor activity deﬁnition, allows new valid instances to be sampled from each deﬁnition, providing\npotentially inﬁnite number of instances per activity. The resulting instances vary over scene, object\nmodels, and conﬁguration, supported by implementation in iGibson 2.0 and BEHAVIOR Object\ndataset. Related benchmarks focus on fewer tasks, mostly limited to kinematic state changes and\nwith scene- or position-constant instantiation (see Table 1 Diversity).\nComplexity in BEHAVIOR Activities:\nBeyond diversity across activities, BEHAVIOR also raises\nthe complexity of the activities themselves by benchmarking full household activities that parallel the\nlength (number of steps an agent needs), the number of objects involved, and the number of required\ncapabilities of real-world chores (see Fig. A.3, comparison in Table 1 Complexity). Compared to\nactivities in existing benchmarks, these activities are very long-horizon with some requiring several\nthousand steps (even for humans in VR; see Fig. A.12), involve more objects (avg. 10.5), and require\na heterogeneous set of capabilities (range: 2 - 8) to change various environment states.\n4\nDeﬁning Realistic, Diverse, and Complex Household Activities with BDDL\nBEHAVIOR challenges embodied AI agents to achieve a diverse set of complex long-horizon\nhousehold activities through physical interactions in a realistically simulated home environment.\nAdopting the common formalism of partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDP), each\nactivity is represented by the tuple M = (S, A, O, T , R, γ). Here, S is the state space; A is the\naction space; O is the observation space; T (s′|s, a), s ∈S, a ∈A, is the state transition model;\nR(s, a) ∈R is the reward function; γ is the discount factor. Based on a full representation of the\nphysical state, S, the simulation environment generates realistic transitions to embodied AI agents’\nactions, a ∈A, i.e., physical interactions, and close-to-real observations, o ∈O, e.g., virtual images.\nWe deﬁne an activity τ as two sets of states, τ = {Sτ,0, Sτ,g}, where Sτ,0 is a set of possible initial\nstates and Sτ,g is a set of acceptable goal states. In an activity instance, the agent must change the\nworld state from some concrete s0 ∈Sτ,0 to any sg ∈Sτ,g. However, describing activities in the\nphysical state space generates scene- or pose-speciﬁc deﬁnitions (e.g., [23, 30, 29]) that are far more\nspeciﬁc than how humans represent these activities, limiting the diversity and complexity of existing\nembodied AI benchmarks. To overcome this, we introduce BEHAVIOR Domain Deﬁnition Language\n4\nBurnt(ﬁsh)\nCooked(ﬁsh)\nFrozen(ﬁsh)\nSliced(tomato)\nOpen(microwave)\nDusty(table)\nStained(plate)\nSoaked(rag)\nToggledOn(stove)\nInRoom(bed, bedroom)\nOnFloor(shoe)\nOnTopOf(apple, plate)\nInsideOf(food, fridge)\nUnder(present, tree)\nNextTo(book, bag)\nFigure 2: Unary and Binary Predicates in BDDL: We represent object states and relationships to other objects\nbased on their kinematics, temperature, wetness level and other physical and functional properties, enabling a\ndiverse and complex set of realistic activities\n(BDDL), a predicate logic-based language that establishes a symbolic state representation built on\npredeﬁned, meaningful predicates grounded in simulated physical states; its variables and constants\nrepresent object categories from the BEHAVIOR object dataset. Each activity is deﬁned in BDDL as\nan initial and goal condition parametrizing sets of possible initial states and satisfactory goal states\n¯Sτ,0 and ¯Sτ,g. BDDL predicates create symbolic counterparts of the physical state, ¯S (see Fig. 2).\nBDDL overcomes limitations that hinder diversity through two mechanisms: ﬁrst, an initial condition\nmaps to inﬁnite physical states in diverse scenes. Second, a goal condition detects all semantically\nsatisfactory solutions, rather than limiting to a few or only those that obey semantically uninterest-\ning geometric constraints (see Fig. A.6 for examples). This state-based deﬁnition is also entirely\ndeclarative, providing a true benchmark of planning ability. By comparison, other benchmarks are\nlimited to scene- or pose-speciﬁc instantiation and solution acceptance, and\/or have imperative plans.\nBEHAVIOR includes a systematic generation pipeline (see A.3.3) allowing unlimited deﬁnitions\nper activity and formalizing the inherent subjectivity and situationality of household activities. We\ninclude 200 deﬁnitions and 300 activity instances in simulation (see Sec. 5). BEHAVIOR is thus the\nonly benchmark equipped to formalize unlimited human-deﬁned versions of an activity and create\npractically inﬁnite unique instantiations in any scene.\n5\nInstantiating BEHAVIOR in a Realistic Physics Simulator\nWhile BEHAVIOR is not bounded to any speciﬁc simulation environment, there are a set of functional\nrequirements that are necessary to simulate BEHAVIOR activities: 1) maintain an object-centric\nrepresentation (object identities enriched with properties and states), 2) simulate physical forces and\nmotion, and generate virtual sensor signals (images), 3) simulate additional, non-kinematic properties\nper object (e.g. temperature, wetness level, cleanliness level), 4) implement functionality to generate\nvalid instances based on the literals deﬁning an activity’s initial condition, e.g., instantiating an object\ninsideOf another, and 5) implement functionality to evaluate the atomic formulae relevant to the\ngoal condition, e.g. checking whether an object is cooked or onTopOf another.\nAdditionally, the simulator must provide an interface of the action space A and the observation\nspace O of the underlying POMDP to embodied AI agents (Sec. 4). While BEHAVIOR activities\nare not tailored to a speciﬁc embodiment, we propose two concrete bodies to fulﬁll the activities\n(see Fig. 1): a bimanual humanoid avatar (24 degrees of freedom, DoF), and a Fetch robot (12\/13\nDoF), both capable of navigating, grasping and interacting with the hand(s). Humans in VR embody\nthe bimanual humanoid. Agents trained with the Fetch embodiment could be directly tested with\na real-world version of the hardware (see discussion on sim2real in Sec. A.8). Both embodiments\nreceive sensor signals from the on-board virtual sensors, and perform actions at 30 Hz.\nWe provide a fully functional implementation of BEHAVIOR using iGibson 2.0, a new version\nof the open-source simulation environment iGibson that fulﬁlls the requirements above. iGibson\n5\nFigure 3: Evaluation of human performance in collect_misplaced_items: (Left) success score, Q;\n(Right) efﬁciency metrics: kinematic disarrangement, (Dk, dotted), hand interaction displacement (Lright, green,\nand Lleft, blue); frames at the top depict signiﬁcant events detected by the metrics; the success score detects the\ncompletion of activity-relevant steps; exploration, manipulation and scene disruption events are captured by the\nefﬁciency metrics that provide complementary information about the performance of the agent\n2.0 provides an object-centric representation with additional properties, support for sources of heat\nand water, dust and stain particles, and changes in object appearance based on extended states.\nWe implement the two embodiments in iGibson 2.0: the agent receives proprioceptive information\nand has access to iGibson 2.0’s generated realistic signals: RGB, depth images, LiDAR, normals,\nﬂow (optical, spatial), and semantic and instance segmentation. While this control and sensing\nsetup is standard in BEHAVIOR, we additionally implement a set of action primitives inspired\nby [25, 54, 59, 24] to facilitate solution prototyping and task-planning research. The primitives\nexecute sequences of low-level actions resulting from a motion planning process (bilateral RRT∗[60])\nto navigateTo, grasp, placeOnTop, placeInside, open, and close the target object provided\nas arguments. Even though the agent only relies on sensory observations to decide on action primitive,\nthe primitives themselves internally assume access to privileged information (e.g. object identities,\nposes, and geometric shapes for planning). Further details can be found in Sec. A.4 and in the\ncross-submission included in appendix. Our implementation of BEHAVIOR in iGibson 2.0 goes\nbeyond the capabilities of existing benchmarks and ampliﬁes realism, diversity, and complexity.\n6\nEvaluation Metrics: Success, Efﬁciency and Human-Centric Metric\nBEHAVIOR provides evaluation metrics to quantify the performance of an embodied AI solution.\nExtending prior metrics suggested for Rearrangement [23], we propose a primary metric based on\nsuccess and several secondary metrics for characterizing efﬁciency.\nPrimary Metric – Success Score Q:\nThe main goal of an embodied AI agent in BEHAVIOR is\nto perform an activity successfully (i.e., all logical expressions in the goal condition are met). A\nbinary deﬁnition of success, however, only signals the end of a successful execution and cannot assess\ninterim progress. To provide more guidance to agents and enable comparisons of partial solutions,\nwe propose success score as the primary metric, deﬁned as the maximum fraction of satisﬁed goal\nliterals in a ground solution to the goal condition at each step. More formally:\nGiven an activity τ with goal state set ¯Sτ,g, its goal condition can be ﬂattened to a set C of conjunctions\nCi of ground literals lji. For any Ci ∈C, if all lji ∈Ci are true then the goal condition is satisﬁed\n(see A.3.2 for deﬁnitions and technical details on ﬂattening), i.e. for some current environment state\ns, we have W\nCi\nV\nlji\nlji = True =⇒s ∈¯Sτ,g . We compute the fraction of literals lji that are True\nfor each Ci, and deﬁne the overall success score by taking the maximum: Q = max\nC\n|{lji |lji =True}|\n|Ci|\n,\nwhere | · | is set cardinality.\nAn activity is complete when all literals in at least one Ci of its goal condition are satisﬁed, achieving\nQ = 1 (100%). Fig. 3 left depicts time evolution of Q during an activity execution. Q extends the\nfraction of objects in acceptable poses proposed as metric in [23], generalized to any type of activity.\nSecondary Metrics – Efﬁciency:\nBeyond success, efﬁciency is critical to evaluation; a successful\nsolution in real-world tasks may be ineffective if it takes too long or causes scene disruption. We\npropose six secondary metrics that complement the primary metric (see Fig. 3, right, for examples):\n6\n• Simulated time, Tsim: Accumulated time in simulation during execution as the number of\nsimulated steps times the average simulated time per step. Tsim is independent of the computer used.\n• Kinematic disarrangement, DK: Displacement caused by the agent in the environment. This can\nbe accumulated over time, or differential, i.e. computed between two time steps, e.g. initial, ﬁnal.\n• Logical disarrangement, DL: Amount of changes caused by the agent in the logical state of the\nenvironment. This can be accumulated over time or differential between two time steps.\n• Distance navigated, Lbody: Accumulated distance traveled by the agent’s base body. This metric\nevaluates the efﬁciency of the agent in navigating the environment.\n• Displacement of hands, Lleft and Lright: Accumulated displacement of each of the agent’s hands\nwhile in contact with another object for manipulation (i.e., grasping, pushing, etc). This metric\nevaluates the efﬁciency of the agent in its interaction with the environment.\nThese efﬁciency metrics above can be quantiﬁed in absolute units (e.g., distance, time) for scene- and\nactivity-speciﬁc comparisons (general efﬁciency). To enable fair comparisons cross diverse activities\nin BEHAVIOR, we also propose normalization relative to human performance (human-centric\nefﬁciency); given a human demonstration for an activity instance in VR, each secondary metric can\nbe expressed as a fraction of the maximum human performance on that metric.\nFor this purpose, we present the BEHAVIOR Dataset of Human Demonstrations with 500 successful\ndemonstrations of BEHAVIOR activities in VR (758.5 min). Humans are immersed in iGibson 2.0,\ncontrolling the same embodiment used by the AI agents (details in Sec. A.6). The dataset includes\na complete record of human actions including manipulation, navigation, and gaze tracking data\n(Fig. A.12, Fig. A.14, and Fig. A.16), supporting analysis and subactivity segmentation (Fig. A.11).\nSec. A.6.2 presents a comprehensive analysis of these data; we quantify human performance in\nBEHAVIOR efﬁciency metrics (see Fig. A.12), and Fig. A.13 provides a further decomposition of\nroom occupancy and hand usage across each BEHAVIOR activity. To our knowledge, this is the\nlargest available dataset of human behavior in VR; these data can facilitate development of new\nsolutions for embodied AI (e.g., imitation learning) and also support studies of human cognition,\nplanning, and motor control in ecological environments.\n7\nEvaluating Reinforcement Learning in BEHAVIOR\nIn this section, we aim to experimentally demonstrate the challenges imposed by BEHAVIOR’s\nrealism, diversity, and complexity by evaluating the performance of some current state-of-the-art\nembodied AI solutions. While BEHAVIOR is a benchmark for all kinds of embodied AI methods,\nhere we evaluate two reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that have demonstrated excellent results\nin simpler embodied AI tasks with continuous or discrete action spaces [61, 62, 21, 63–67]: Soft-\nActor Critic (SAC [16]) and Proximal-Policy Optimization (PPO [17]). We use SAC to train policies\nin the original low-level continuous action space of the agent, and PPO for experiments using our\nimplemented action primitives (for details on the agents, see Sec. 5). Due to limited computational\nresources, we run our evaluation on the 12 most simple activities (based on involved types of state\nchanges) until convergence. Reward is given by our staggered success score Q. We use as input to\nthe policies a subset of the realistic agent’s observations, RGB, depth and proprioception (excluding\nLiDAR, segmentation, etc.). Sec. A.7 includes more experimental details.\nResults in the original activities:\nThe ﬁrst row of Table 2 shows the results of SAC (mean Q at\nthe end of training for 3 seeds) on the original 12 activities with the standard setup: realistic robot\nactions and onboard sensing. Even for these “simpler” activities, BEHAVIOR is too great a challenge:\nthe training agents do not fulﬁll any predicate in the goal condition (Q = 0). In the following, we will\nanalyze how each dimension of difﬁculty (realism, diversity, complexity) contributes to these results.\nEffect of complexity (activity length):\nIn the ﬁrst experiment, we evaluate the impact of the\nactivity complexity (time length) in robot learning performance. First, we evaluate the performance\nof an RL algorithm using our implemented action primitives based on motion planning. These are\ntemporally extended actions that effectively shorten the horizon and length of the activity. The\nresults of training with PPO are depicted in the second row of Table 2. Even in these simpler\nconditions, agents fail in all but one activity (bringingInWood, Q = 0.13). In a second oracle-\ndriven experiment, we take a successful human demonstration for each activity from the BEHAVIOR\nDataset and save the state of the environment a few seconds before its successful execution at T. We\n7\nuse this as initial state and train agents with SAC: rows 3 to 6 of Table 2 show the mean success rate\n(SR, full accomplishment of the activity) in 100 evaluation episodes for the ﬁnal policy resulting\nfrom training with three different random seeds (Q starts here close to 1 and is less informative).\nEven when starting 1 s away from a goal state, most learning agents fail to achieve the tasks. A\nfew achieve better success but their performance decreases quickly as we start further away from\nthe successful execution, being zero for all activities at 10 s. This indicates that the long-horizon\nof the activities in BEHAVIOR is in fact a paramount challenge for reinforcement learning. We\nhypothesize that Embodied AI solutions with a hierarchical structure such as hierarchical-RL or\ntask-and-motion-planning (TAMP) may help to overcome the challenges of high complexity (length)\nof the BEHAVIOR activities [68–71].\nbringingInWood\ncollectMisplacedItems\nmovingBoxesToStorage\norganizingFileCabinet\nthrowingAwayLeftovers\nputtingDishesAway\nputtingleftoversAway\nre-shelvingLibraryBooks\nlayingTileFloors\nsettingUpCandles\npickingUpTrash\nstoringFood\nQca\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\ncomplexity\nQap\n0.13\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nSRca@T −1 s\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0.97\n1\nSRca@T −2 s\n1\n0.07\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0.01\n0\nSRca@T −3 s\n1\n0.21\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0.01\n0\n0\nSRca@T −10 s\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nrealism\nQca\nFullObs\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nQap\nFullObs\n0.20\n0.02\n0.49\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.13\n0\n0.09\n0\n0\nQap\nNoPhys\n0.92\n0.47\n0.73\n0\n0.32\n0.55\n0.44\n0.04\n0\n0.27\n0\n0.32\nQap\nNoPhys,FullObs\n1.0\n0.95\n0.83\n0\n0.56\n0.94\n0.55\n0.56\n0\n0.5\n0.67\n1.0\nTable 2: Evaluation of state-of-the-art RL algorithms on BE-\nHAVIOR Fully realistic, diverse and complex (row 1): SAC [16]\nfor visuomotor continuous actions (superindex ca) performs poorly\nin all activities; Complexity analysis (rows 2-6): reducing complex-\nity (horizon) with temporally extended action primitives (superindex\nap and gray cells, trained with PPO [17]) or by starting few seconds\naway from a goal state, lead to some non-zero success rate (SR).\nRealism analysis (rows 7-10): Only by reducing realism in obser-\nvations and physics, and complexity through action primitives, RL\nachieves signiﬁcant success in a handful of the activities.\nEffect of realism (in sensing and ac-\ntuation):\nIn a third experiment, we\nevaluate how much the realism in ac-\ntuation and sensing affects the perfor-\nmance of embodied AI solutions. To\nevaluate the effect of realistic observ-\nability of the BEHAVIOR activities in\nthe performance of robot learning ap-\nproaches, we train agents with contin-\nuous motion control (SAC), and mo-\ntion primitives (PPO) assuming full-\nobservability of the state. Tables 2\n(rows 7-8, subindex FullObs) depict\nthe results. We observe that even with\nfull observability the complexity dom-\ninates policies in the original action\nspace and they do not accomplish any\npart of the activities. For policies selecting among action primitives, there is some partial success only\nin ﬁve of the activities indicating that the perceptual problem is part of the difﬁculty in BEHAVIOR.\nTo evaluate the effect of realistic actuation, we train an agent using action primitives that execute\nwithout physics simulation, achieving their expected outcome (e.g. grasp an object, or place it some-\nwhere). Tables 2 (row 9-10, subindex noPhys) shows the results, also in combination with unrealistic\nfull-observability. We observe that without the difﬁculties of realistic physics and actuation, the\nlearning agents achieve an important part of most activities, accomplishing consistently two of them\n(Q = 1) when full-observability of the state is also granted. This indicates that the generation of the\ncorrect actuation is a critical challenge for embodied AI solutions, even when they infer the right next\nstep at the task-planning level, supporting the importance of benchmarks with realistically action\nexecution over predeﬁned action outcomes.\nDiversity in. ..\nobject poses\nobject instances\nontop\nsliced\nsoaked\nstained\ncooked\né\né\n1\n0.15\n1\n1\n1\nË\né\n0.825\n0\n0.935\n0.28\n0.66\nË\nË\n0.46\n0\n0.925\n0.11\n0.265\nTable 3: Evaluation of the effect of BEHAVIOR’s diversity: Re-\nsults of training agents with SAC [16] in single-predicate activities\nof increasing diversity; Even in these simple activities, performance\ndegrades quickly indicating that current state-of-the-art cannot cope\nwith the dimensions of diversity spanned in BEHAVIOR\nEffect\nof\ndiversity\n(in\nactivity\ninstance\nand\nobjects):\nAnother\ncause of the poor performance of\nrobot learning solutions in the 12 BE-\nHAVIOR activities may be the high\ndiversity in multiple dimensions, such\nas scenes, objects, and initial states.\nThis diversity forces embodied AI so-\nlutions to generalize to all possible\nconditions.

We evaluate\ntraining with RL (SAC) for each activity under diverse instantiations: initialization of the activity\n(object poses) and object instances. The results are shown in Table 3, where we report Q. First,\nwe train without any diversity as baseline to understand the ground complexity of the single-literal\nactivities. All agents achieve success. Then, we evaluate how well the RL policies train for a diverse\nset of instances of the activities, ﬁrst changing objects’ initial pose, then changing the object.

These experiments\n8\nindicate that the diversity in BEHAVIOR goes beyond what current RL algorithms can handle even\nin simpliﬁed activities, and poses a challenge for generalization in embodied AI.\n8\nConclusion and Future Work\nWe presented BEHAVIOR, a novel benchmark for embodied AI solutions of household activities.\nBEHAVIOR presents 100 realistic, diverse and complex activities with a new logic-symbolic represen-\ntation, a fully functional simulation-based implementation, and a set of human-centric metrics based\non the performance of humans on the same activities in VR. The activities push the state-of-the-art\nin benchmarking adding new types of state changes that the agent needs to be able to cause, such\nas cleaning surfaces or changing object temperatures. Our experiments with two state-of-the-art RL\nbaselines shed light on the challenges presented by BEHAVIOR’s level of realism, diversity and\ncomplexity. BEHAVIOR will be open-source and free to use; we hope it facilitates participation and\nfair access to research tools, and paves the way towards a new generation of embodied AI.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Bokui Shen, Xi Jia Zhou, and Jim Fan for comments, ideas, and support in data\ncollection.

Tracing their origins to 19th-\ncentury murder mystery novels and early 20th-\ncentury party puzzles, these games have particu-\nlarly flourished in China in recent years. In this con-\ntext, they are referred to as \"Jubensha\", \"Scripted\nMurders\" or 剧本杀in Chinese, and have experi-\nenced a remarkable surge in popularity since the\nlate 2010s. Influenced by Western murder mystery\ngames, Jubensha games center around players who\ngather to identify the murderer by analyzing and\ninterpreting the provided story scripts. The thrill\n∗Equal contribution.\n†Canada CIFAR AI Chair.\nSelect script\nAssign roles\nto players\nPlayers read\ntheir scripts\nCollect clues\nfor reasoning\nGrop discussion\nto find out murderer\nVote to\ndecide the murderer\n。。。\n。。。\n。。。\n。。。\nFigure 1: Illustration of the Jubensha game. It requires\nplayers to interact with each other and reason about who\nis the murderer in a story.\nfor players to collect and interpret clues through\nintense social interaction and reasoning has made\nplaying Jubensha stand out as a notable cultural\nphenomenon.\nMeanwhile, the field of Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) is reshaping the gaming landscape. From\nclassic games like chess (Campbell et al., 2002),\nGo (Silver et al., 2016), and poker (Brown and\nSandholm, 2019; Brown et al., 2020) to video\ngames like StarCraft (Vinyals et al., 2017, 2019),\nLeague of Legends (Lohokare et al., 2020), and\nHonor of Kings (Ye et al., 2020), AI contenders\nor collaborators have been integrated into these\ngames. The recent surge in Large Language Mod-\nels (LLMs) has redirected research interest from\nconventional and video games to text-based games.\nSignificant examples include an LLM deployed as\nagents in the strategic game CICERO (FAIR et al.,\n2022), in the communicative game Werewolf (Xu\net al., 2023), and in the text-based adventure game\nZork (Tsai et al., 2023).\nHowever, the “Jubensha game” remains an un-\ndeveloped field in terms of AI agents specifically\n1\narXiv:2312.00746v2  [cs.AI]  29 Feb 2024\ntailored for its gameplay and evaluation. We be-\nlieve there are several reasons. First, before the\nemergence of LLMs, understanding the character\nplots, role tasks, and game rules in the script of\nJubensha games was very challenging. Not to men-\ntion the need for AI agents to engage in multi-round\nlinguistic interactions, information gathering, and\nlogical reasoning. Second, currently there is no\npublicly available dataset specifically for Jubensha\ngames that researchers can use to develop and eval-\nuate their agents. Third, quantitatively and qual-\nitatively automating the evaluation of AI agents’\nperformance in Jubensha games is also very dif-\nficult. The most commonly used win-rate metric\nin other game AIs is also of limited use in assess-\ning the performance of Jubensha game agents, i.e.,\nwin rate does not show the extent of the Jubensha\nAI’s mastery of case information or the level of its\nreasoning ability.\nIn response to the above-mentioned challenges,\nwe attempt to provide a solution in this work. This\nwork focuses on constructing a multi-agent interac-\ntion framework in a “Jubensha” game environment\nusing large language models, and we have designed\na set of methods to quantitatively and qualitatively\nassess the performance of Large Language Model\nbased (LLM-based) agents. Our contributions can\nbe summarized as follows:\n1. We have created a Chinese dataset providing\ncharacter scripts and preset game rules to ini-\ntiate a Jubensha game. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first dataset specifically\ntailored for AI agents playing in a Jubensha\ngame setting.\n2. We designed a framework for multi-agent in-\nteraction in a Jubensha game environment us-\ning large language models, allowing multiple\nLLM-based agents to autonomously interact\nwith each other in a Jubensha game setting,\nwithout the need for human intervention.\n3. To quantitatively and qualitatively assess the\nperformance of large language model based\nagents in Jubensha games, we designed two\nnovel tasks: one to evaluate their mastery of\ncase information and another to assess their\nreasoning abilities with the information col-\nlected during the game.\n4. Utilizing the latest advancements in the field\nof in-context learning, we devised modules\nto enhance the performance of LLM-based\nagents. Our evaluations show that this de-\nsign significantly enhances the information\nmastery, murderer identification, and reason-\ning capabilities of LLM-based agents in the\nJubensha game context.\n2\nRelated Work\nInteractive Role-Playing Games\nIRPGs provide\nimmersive experiences in fictional settings, serving\nas a multidisciplinary research testbed in various\nfields (Zagal and Deterding, 2018; Barreteau et al.,\n2003; Nagata et al., 2021). These games are cate-\ngorized into SRPGs and MRPGs, each with unique\nresearch opportunities. SRPGs focus on character\nadvancement through quests in various themes (In-\nfocom, 1980; Côté et al., 2019; Szot et al., 2021;\nFan et al., 2022; Shridhar et al., 2020; Wang et al.,\n2022a). While MRPGs highlight collaborative sto-\nrytelling (Lai et al., 2023; Park et al., 2023; Fu\net al., 2023; Kramár et al., 2022; FAIR et al.,\n2022). This work presents a dataset for MRPG\nJubensha, aimed at supporting studies on the de-\nvelopment and evaluation of communicative and\nreasoning AI in an adversarial game setting.\nLLM-based Autonomous Agents.\nThanks to\ntheir strong capabilities in language comprehen-\nsion and reasoning, LLMs have demonstrated sig-\nnificant potential for achieving impressive perfor-\nmance in tasks that focus on advancing charac-\nters. (Wang et al., 2023a; Wei et al., 2022; Wang\net al., 2022b; Yao et al., 2023, 2022; Shinn et al.,\n2023). However, only a few works explore the\nmulti-agent interaction under complex settings (Xu\net al., 2023; Junprung, 2023; Lai et al., 2023). To\nbridge the gap, we propose the first LLM-based\nmulti-agent interaction framework on Jubensha, al-\nlowing autonomous agent engaging and facilitating\nfurther study on advanced study topics.\nEvaluating LLM-based Agents.\nDespite the\nquick development of LLM-based agents, assess-\ning their abilities in MRPGs can still be essential\nand challenging. Recent initiatives (Wang et al.,\n2023b; Shao et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2023; Xu\net al., 2023) propose several simple subjective and\nobjective evaluation metrics for LLM-based agents\nunder multi-role settings. However, it can still be\nchallenging to assess the capabilities of LLM-based\nagents for MRPGs using simple evaluation metrics,\nsuch as win rate. To address this issue, we pro-\npose a set of systematic and objective evaluation\n2\nmethods designed to measure the information gath-\nering and reasoning abilities of LLM-based agents\nin Jubensha.\n3\nJubensha Dataset\nText\nImage\nAudio\nVideo\nTotal\n#\n1115\n643\n392\n172\n1115\nTable 1: Number of Jubensha game scripts by modality\nin our dataset.\nPlayers\nTokens\nmin\nmax\navg\nmin\nmax\navg\n#\n1\n20\n6.52\n4k\n518k\n129k\nTable 2: Statics on number of players and tokens for the\nJubensha game scripts in our dataset.\nTo enhance AI deployment in Jubensha games,\nwe have compiled a comprehensive dataset from\nover 1,100 Jubensha game instances in Chinese.1\nThis dataset is a valuable addition to MRPG re-\nsearch, presenting unique challenges and opportu-\nnities for advancement. 2\nBackground of Jubensha Game\nJubensha is a\ndetective role-playing game with multiple players,\nwhere each player is assigned a unique role tied to\na central murder mystery. As shown in Figure 1,\nthe game process typically consists of six stages: 1)\nEach player selects a script for distinct characters\nin a Jubensha game. 2) Players are assigned with\na role (murderer or civilian) associated with their\nselected scripts. 3) The players read their scripts to\ndevelop a basic understanding of the whole story\nfrom their views. 4) Each player is given a pool\nof clues to help them reveal or hide critical de-\ntails for finding the murderer. 5) Several rounds\nof group discussion are held among the players to\nshare information and find out the murderer. 6).\nFinally, each player anonymously votes to decide\nthe murderer. The civilians win the game if the\ntrue murderer gets the most votes, otherwise, the\nmurderer wins.\nDataset Construction\nTo establish an environ-\nment capable of evaluating Jubensha agents and to\nfacilitate future scaled-up works, we collect 1,115\ninstances of Jubensha games in Chinese online.\n1Currently, this dataset is in Chinese, but we are open to\nexpanding it to other languages in the future. We use English\nexamples in the main text for the convenience of the readers.\n2We will release this dataset post-acceptance for academic\npurposes only.\nEach game consists of a host manual describing\nhow to control the game process and a God’s-eye\nview of case replays, along with individual scripts\nfor each character in the game. As demonstrated\nin Table 2, the number of players can vary from 1\nto 20, and the number of tokens for the game can\nbe as large as 518k, facilitating further research on\nsocially intelligent AI and introducing extra-long\ntext comprehension and reasoning challenges. Be-\nsides, as shown in Table 1, some of these scripts\nalso contain multimodal clues, including audio and\nvideo. To create a unified experimental environ-\nment, this work concentrates exclusively on text-\nmodality Jubensha games.\n4\nThe ThinkThrice Framework for\nJubensha Games\nWe have designed an interaction framework for\nLLM-based agents specifically crafted for Juben-\nsha games. In this framework, each LLM-based\nagent is responsible for playing the role of a player\nin the Jubensha game narrative. Typically, each\nJubensha game involves 4-5 players portrayed by\nLLM-based agents. Besides, we have a non-player\ncharacter serving as the host, who is responsible\nfor guiding the game. Unlike other players driven\nby large language models, the host’s questions and\ncommands are pre-set to ensure the game follows\na designated process. As for the LLM-based agent\nplayers, they are embedded with character informa-\ntion specific to their roles. Based on this informa-\ntion, they interact with other characters including\nother players and the host. These interactions are\nsynchronous, meaning only one agent acts at a spe-\ncific moment. All actions of the LLM-based agent\nplayers, such as whom to question or how to re-\nspond to questions from other players or the host,\nare generated by an LLM based on their character\nscripts and historical chat records, as shown in Fig-\nure 2. Moreover, we have also set a finite number\nof rounds for each game to mimic the time-limited\nrules of real Jubensha games. Although currently\nfocusing on Jubensha, our framework design is\nflexible, potentially requiring minimal adjustments\nfor application in other contexts.\nWe name our framework for multi-agent mystery\ngames as ThinkThrice, or 三思in Chinese. The\nname comes from a Chinese proverb: “thinking\nthrice before acting (三思而后行)”. Figure 2 illus-\ntrates the overall design of our ThinkThrice frame-\nwork, which outlines the process by which a player\n3\nLLM\n       Question (Q): Please ﬁrst introduce your role, then talk about the victim of the case \nyou are aware of: what kind of person is Boss Yang, and what is your relationship with \nhim.

The three different colors of the arrows indicate the data flows of three stages: 1)\nInitial answer generation with Memory Retrieval; 2) Enhance answer with Self-Refinement; 3) Verify answer with\nSelf-Verification. The brown texts in the refined answer are new information added to the initial answer.\ngenerates a response to a question through three\nmain stages: Memory Retrieval, Self-Refinement,\nand Self-Verification.\nMemory Retrieval\nDue to the limited context\nwindow of LLMs, a special memory retrieval mod-\nule is often needed to store and appropriately re-\ntrieve all historical records observed by LLM-based\nagents (Park et al., 2023; Lai et al., 2023). Our\nframework adopts this widely used method to help\nagents remember dialogues and events in the Juben-\nsha games and retrieve specific memory fragments\nwhen needed. Specifically, we record all observa-\ntions of the agent into a vector database exclusive\nto the agent using the OpenAI API (OpenAI, 2023).\nWhen the agent observes a new event requiring ac-\ntion, we use the Faiss library3 to quickly search\nthe agent’s exclusive vector database for multiple\nhistorical records with the top 5 highest similari-\nties and include them in the current action prompt.\nWe have observed that this simple module is also\nvery helpful in improving the performance of LLM-\nbased agents in our Jubensha games.\nSelf-Refinement\nThe\ngoal\nof\nthe\nSelf-\nRefinement module is to ensure that LLM-based\nagents provide as much information and details\nas possible when responding to questions from\nothers.\nAs shown in Figure 2, when an agent\n3https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/faiss\nreceives a question from others, it first attempts\nto generate an initial answer internally (see the\ngreen lines). During the Self-Refinement stage,\nthe agent decomposes the asked question Q into\nseveral sub-questions: q1, q2, . . . , qn. It then uses\nthese sub-questions to retrieve relevant facts from\nthe character scripts S that can be used to answer\nthese sub-questions. For each relevant fact, the\nagent checks whether they are included in the\ninitial answer. If not, they are added to form part\nof the refined answer (see the orange lines in\nFigure 2). We can see that the refined answer, after\nthe Self-Refinement module, contains more details\nand information than the initial answer, thereby\nenhancing the agent’s communication efficiency\nwithin a limited number of rounds.\nSelf-Verification\nLLM hallucinations are a very\ncommon and thorny problem (Dhuliawala et al.,\n2023). To ensure that the content of LLM-based\nagents’ answers is authentic and not hallucinated,\nwe designed a Self-Verification module. This mod-\nule breaks down the agent’s answer A into multiple\nfacts a1, a2, . . . , an and then compares these facts\none by one with the agent’s character script S for\nauthenticity. Only when the agent’s answer meets\nour preset authenticity threshold (measured by the\nabsolute number and accuracy of real facts) will\nthe agent output the answer (see the blue lines in\nFigure 2). If the answer does not meet the preset\n4\nthreshold, the agent will need to regenerate the an-\nswer until the authenticity of the agent’s answer\nmeets the requirements or exceeds the maximum\nnumber of attempts. Since the agent’s best output\nmay not necessarily occur in the last attempt, we\nscore each answer based on the degree of authen-\nticity and the number of words, keeping a copy of\nthe highest-scoring answer each time. By doing\nso, we can ensure that even if all of the agent’s\nattempts fail to meet the authenticity threshold, it\nwill still output the highest quality answer from all\nits previous attempts.\n5\nEvaluating LLM-based Agents in\nJubensha Games\nPrevious work has primarily employed metrics\nsuch as human-likeness and win rate to assess the\nperformance of LLM-based agents in games (Wang\net al., 2023a; Lai et al., 2023). These metrics either\nrequire substantial human involvement or likely\nleading to less reliable experimental conclusions\ndue to the challenges in controlling variables (Lai\net al., 2023).4 Considering the unique character-\nistics of Jubensha games, we have designed two\ntasks to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate\nthe performance of LLM-based agents in Jubensha\ngames: Factual Question Answering and Inferen-\ntial Question Answering.\nFactual Question Answering\nThe process of\ngathering information in Jubensha games is crucial\nfor LLM-based agents to understand the implied\nrelationships and conflicts in the story, reconstruct\nthe entire case, and deduce the truth. To evaluate\nhow much information LLM-based agents gathered\nin Jubensha games, we designed a factual question-\nanswering task and use GPTs to generate questions.\nWe have generated a total of 720 factual questions\nfor 4 selected Jubensha games containing 4 or 5\nplayers, of which two examples are presented in\nTable 3. Due to limited space, we have included\nthe prompts of our generation method in the ap-\npendix H.\nInferential Question Answering\nOnce LLM-\nbased agents have gathered the necessary informa-\ntion, another important step is using it for inference.\nThis step is particularly crucial in Jubensha games,\nwhere the truth of the case is often obscured by\nnumerous clues. To evaluate the reasoning abili-\n4This is particularly the case when both sides in the game\nare played by LLMs\nExample 1\nQuestion: Who does Mate Zhang’s brother\nwork for?\nAnswer: Boss Yang\nSource: He works for Boss Yang, owner of\na famous bar in City A.

Therefore, it can be\ninferred that {the ’thumping’ sound Dr. Ling\nheard on her way to kill Boss Yang was most\nlikely made by Secretary Wen}CONCLUSION.\nTable 4: Example of Inferential Questions.\nties of LLM-based agents, we manually designed\na total of 56 inferential questions for 4 selected\nJubensha games, of which an example is shown in\nTable 4. Note that the PREMISE 1 is from Secre-\ntary Wen’s script and the PREMISE 2 is from Dr.\nLing’s script. To answer these questions success-\nfully, LLM-based agents must integrate informa-\ntion collected from different characters and make\ninferences based on this information.\n6\nExperiment\nIn this section, we will briefly discuss the various\nLLMs used in this work. Following this, we will\npresent our experimental results, encompassing the\nevaluation of the information gathering and reason-\ning performance of LLM-based agents.\n5\nOwn Q\nOther’s Q\nAvg\nCQ\nMQ\nAvg\nNo MR\n0.770\n0.300\n0.321\n0.305\nMR\n0.759\n0.409\n0.380\n0.402\nMR+SR\n0.757\n0.467\n0.487\n0.471\nMR+SR+SV(N=1)\n0.768\n0.485\n0.518\n0.492\nMR+SR+SV(N=3)\n0.772\n0.495\n0.514\n0.498\nTable 5: Performance of agents on different kinds of fac-\ntual questions. “Own Q” refers to questions generated\nfrom the agent’s own script, while “Other’s Q” refers to\nquestions from scripts of other agents, inaccessible to\nthe answering agent. “Other’s Q” includes “CQ” (ques-\ntions from other civilians’ scripts) and “MQ” (questions\nfrom the murderer agent’s script). The effectiveness of\ndifferent module combinations in the agents is assessed\nbased on agents’ ability to provide factual responses\nabout themselves and others.

Unless specifically indicated, the GPT-\n3.5 and the GPT-4 model mentioned in this paper\nrefer to gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613 and gpt-4-1106-\npreview respectively. For text embedding we used\ntext-embedding-ada-002 for gameplay and text-\nembedding-3-large for evaluation. More specific\nusages of GPT models are listed in the appendix B.\n6.2\nEvaluation on Agents’ Responses to\nFactual Questions\nThe Table 5 presents the evaluation results on\nagents’ responses to factual questions. We can\nsee that agents with different module combinations\nperformed quite well when answering questions\nfrom their own script. This is understandable be-\ncause agents have full access to their own scripts\nthroughout the game, thereby possessing all the\ninformation needed to correctly answer these ques-\ntions. Since the Memory Retriever (MR) module\nmainly records the communication history among\nagents after the game starts, we can consider agents\nwithout the Memory Retriever as being in a mem-\noryless state. The experimental results in the “No\nMR” row show that agents’ accuracy in answering\nquestions about themselves is significantly higher\nthan in answering questions about others. This gap\nhighlights the significant difference between the\ninformation agents possess about others and about\nthemselves. After introducing the MR module,\nwe observe a significant improvement in agents’\naccuracy in answering questions about others, re-\nflecting the increase in information gained from\ninteractions among agents, which helps them better\nunderstand the roles and stories of other characters\nin the game.\nThe Self-Refinement (SR) and Self-Verification\n(SV) modules mainly ensure the authenticity and\ncomprehensiveness of information during agent\ncommunication. We can observe that the accu-\nracy of agents in answering questions about others\nachieves the best results among all under the com-\nbined effect of the MR module, the SR module, and\nthe SV module (with a maximum of 3 attempts).\nThis demonstrates that our designed modules ef-\nfectively enhance the efficiency of communication\namong agents in the Jubensha game, allowing them\nto acquire more case information under the same\ngame round conditions.\n6.3\nSimilarities between Agent Chat Histories\nand All Players’ Scripts\nTo measure the overall information about all char-\nacters acquired by LLM-based agents in the game\nfrom the textual perspective, we employed three\nmethods to assess the similarities between the chat\nhistories among agents and the scripts of all play-\ners. Firstly, we concatenate all players’ scripts\ninto a single document, then we treat the chat his-\ntories among agents as another document. Then\nwe used OpenAI API (OpenAI, 2023) to encode\nthese two documents respectively. For documents\nbeyond OpenAI API’s max input length, we split\nthem into non-overlapping chunks, average their\ntext embeddings to represent the document. Given\nembeddings of two documents, their cosine simi-\nlarity can be calculated. Additionally, we utilized\nTF-IDF and trigrams to represent the two docu-\nments, and then calculated their cosine and Jaccard\n6\nNo MR\nMR\nMR+SR\nMR+SR+\nSV(N=1)\nMR+SR+\nSV(N=3)\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n0.183\n0.183\n0.225\n0.233\n0.383\n0.191\n0.253\n0.224\n0.283\n0.344\nCivilian Win Rate\nMurderer Identification Accuracy\nFigure 3: Average win rate of civilian players and the\naverage murderer identification accuracy across differ-\nent architectures in Jubensha games.\nsimilarities, respectively. The results from Table 6\nshow that agents embedded with MR, SR, and SV\nmodules have chat histories in the game that are\ncloser to the scripts of all players, which demon-\nstrates that they have acquired more information\nabout all players in a Jubensha game.\n6.4\nCivilian Player Win Rate and Murderer\nIdentification Accuracy\nFigure 3 shows the average win rates of civilian\nplayers and the murderer identification accuracy\nby agents with various module combinations in\nJubensha games. Civilian win rate in Figure 3 is\nthe ratio of the number of games won by civilian\nplayers to the total number of games played. Mur-\nderer identification accuracy is the proportion of\nvotes received by the murderer to the total num-\nber of votes cast by all players. We observed that\nMR+SR+SV(N=3) which performs best in factual\nquestion answering tasks, also achieves the high-\nest average civilian players win rate and murderer\nidentification accuracy. This might be due to agents\nacquiring sufficient information to reconstruct the\ntrue narrative of the case, thereby making it easier\nto accurately identify the murderer.\n6.5\nEvaluation of Agent’s Responses to\nInferential Questions\nTo further evaluate the reasoning capabilities of\nLLM-based agents based on the rationale derived\nfrom collected information, we utilized a set of\ninferential questions. The experimental results are\ndisplayed in Figure 4, where the Overall Accuracy\nrepresents the rate at which agents correctly answer\nquestions, without considering the rationale behind\ntheir responses. In contrast, Informed Accuracy\nrefers to the accuracy achieved when taking into\naccount the rationale provided by agents for their\nanswers. An answer is counted towards Informed\nAccuracy only if the agent’s response is correct and\nNo MR\nMR\nMR+SR\nMR+SR+\nSV (N=1)\nMR+SR+\nSV (N=3)\nFSA\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.056\n0.075\n0.113\n0.136\n0.121\n0.205\n0.106\n0.104\n0.155\n0.181\n0.165\n0.257\n0.137\n0.237\n0.319\n0.342\n0.395\n0.624\n0.194\n0.287\n0.38\n0.385\n0.446\n0.654\nInformed Accuracy (GPT-3.5)\nOverall Accuracy (GPT-3.5)\nInformed Accuracy (GPT-4)\nOverall Accuracy (GPT-4)\nFigure 4: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4’s performance with dif-\nferent methods, where overall accuracy measure the raw\ncorrect percentage and informed accuracy take LLM’s\nreasoning ability into consideration. FSA stands for\n’Full Script Access’, indicating that agents have access\nto the complete scripts of all players.\nthey provide the correct reasoning rationale. This\nmetric demonstrates that agents not only know the\ncorrect answer but also understand why it is correct.\nFrom the results in Figure 4, we can draw two\nimportant observations: 1) The more information\nagents acquire during the game, the more capable\nthey become at solving complex problems through\nreasoning. For instance, when GPT-4 is employed,\nthe agent with full access to all players’ scripts\nachieves the highest overall accuracy and informed\naccuracy. Following this, agents equipped with\nMR+SR+SV(N=3) modules rank second. 2) Given\nthe same amount of information, the LLMs’ inher-\nent ability to utilize this information and reason ef-\nfectively determines the agents’ final performance\nin reasoning tasks. Indeed, simply upgrading from\nGPT-3.5 to GPT-4 can lead to agents achieving dou-\nble or even nearly triple the overall accuracy and\ninformed accuracy.\nQualitative Analysis.\nIn Table 7, we provide a\nqualitative analysis: agents are presented with an\ninferential question and the correct answer which\nthe agents do not know to be correct, and are asked\nto provide the rationale for their reasoning. Each\nrationale provided by the agents is accompanied by\na GPT Eval Score, which measures the similarity\nbetween the agents’ rationale and the ground truth\nrationale. The inferential question, answer, and\nthe ground truth rationale can be found in Table 4.\nFrom Table 7, we observe that with Full Script\nAccess (complete information), agents can easily\nidentify relevant premises and deduce solid con-\nclusions. In cases where agents have incomplete\ninformation, MR+SR+SV (N=3), due to lacking\nspecific details about the exact time Secretary Wen\nwas in the ventilation duct, the conclusion drawn is\n7\nPredicted Rationale\nNo\nMR\n{Dr. Ling couldn’t find the medical cabinet key when she returned to her room at 18:50,\nsuggesting someone had already taken it}IRRELEVANT PREMISE 1; {Secretary Wen asked Dr.\nLing for intelligence at 18:10}IRRELEVANT PREMISE 2, {giving her the opportunity to know\nBoss Yang’s location and possibly plan an action}TENUOUS INTERIM CONCLUSION 3; plus, when\nDr. Ling heard the thumping sound, she was on her way to Boss Yang’s room, and {there’s no\nclear evidence that other suspects were near Boss Yang’s room at that time}FLAWED PREMISE 4;\nmoreover, {the ventilation duct’s baffle had fallen, indicating someone had entered Boss Yang’s\nroom before her}RELEVANT INTERIM CONCLUSION 5; {considering Secretary Wen’s role under\nBoss Yang, she had the chance to approach him}TANGENTIALLY RELEVANT PREMISE 6, {hence\nthe thumping sound was most likely made by Secretary Wen}TENUOUS CONCLUSION.

Our research has yielded four\nmain contributions: the creation of a specialized\ndataset tailored for the Jubensha games, the de-\nsign of a multi-agent interaction framework for\nthe automatic conduct of Jubensha games, the de-\nvelopment of a set of quantitative and qualitative\nassessment methods to measure the information\ngathering and reasoning abilities of LLM-based\nagents within the game, and the utilization of the\nlatest in-context learning techniques to devise mod-\nules that enhance the performance of LLM-based\nagents. We have empirically demonstrated that our\ndesigned multi-agent interaction framework and\nthe in-context learning modules significantly im-\nprove upon the baseline in terms of information\ngathering, murderer identification, and reasoning\ncapabilities. We believe this research will advance\nthe community’s knowledge of LLM-based agents\n8\nand offers a new perspective on evaluating the\nperformance of LLMs in a complex, plot-driven,\nand adversarial reasoning game environment con-\nstrained by narrative contexts.\nEthical Considerations\nOur research delves into the communicative and\nreasoning abilities of large language models\n(LLMs) within the context of \"Jubensha\" (剧本\n杀), a type of Chinese detective role-playing game.\nIt is important to clarify that any portrayals of vio-\nlence in these game scenarios are purely fictional,\nand our work is solely for the purposes of aca-\ndemic analysis. It does not represent or endorse\nreal-world violence in any way. The data employed\nin our study is gathered from online platforms host-\ning Jubensha content. When sharing this dataset,\nwe will implement measures to ensure that its us-\nage remains strictly for academic, non-commercial\npurposes and complies with fair use policies. 5\nLimitations\nWe outline the main limitations of our work as\nfollows:\n• Language Specificity of the Dataset: Our\nJubensha dataset is in Chinese, which means\nour experimental results are specifically re-\nflective of the communicative and reasoning\ncapabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)\nbased agents in Chinese contexts. Consid-\nering that the majority of LLM evaluation\nbenchmarks are in English, and existing LLM-\nbased agent frameworks are tailored for En-\nglish applications, our Chinese-centric bench-\nmark and framework could provide a valuable\naddition to the field.\n• Variability in Experimental Outcomes: The\ninherent stochastic nature of LLM outputs\nmay lead to significant variability in single-\nexperiment results. For instance, in the mur-\nderer identification voting phase, LLM-driven\nplayers may choose differently among sus-\npects if given another chance. Similarly, game\nprocesses can diverge significantly, even with\nidentical starting conditions. To mitigate this,\nwe conducted three runs of each Jubensha\n5https:\/\/www.copyright.gov\/fair-use\/index.\nhtml\nhttps:\/\/www.gov.cn\/guoqing\/2021-10\/29\/content_\n5647633.htm\ngame script with LLM-based agents for each\nproposed architectures and averaged the out-\ncomes. For highly variable tasks like murderer\nidentification, agents performed 10 memory-\nless votes, from which we calculated identifi-\ncation accuracy and civilian win rates. How-\never, due to time and budget constraints, fur-\nther experiments to solidify these results were\nnot feasible. We will make our code, dataset,\nand all intermediate results available post-\nacceptance, including chat histories, voting\nrecords, agents’ responses to factual and in-\nferential questions, and GPT models’ evalu-\nations on these responses, to help interested\nreaders replicate our experiments and better\nunderstand our findings.\n• Model Updates and Replication Costs: Re-\nproducing our findings might be challeng-\ning due to OpenAI’s periodic model updates,\nwhich can lead to different results with dif-\nferent model versions. To address this, we\nspecify the exact version of GPT used in each\nexperiment in the appendix B and will publish\nour code post-acceptance. Moreover, the cost\nof replicating our experiments can be costly.\nWe aim to alleviate this by providing an illus-\ntrative cost breakdown for each experimental\nstep in the appendix D, helping readers gauge\npotential expenses before attempting replica-\ntion.","pdf_path":"tools\/arxiv_tools\/asset\/pdf\/\/Deciphering Digital Detectives: Understanding LLM Behaviors and Capabilities in Multi-Agent Mystery Games.pdf","query_prompt":"### 任务\n你是一个人工智能领域的专家，你能够快速阅读arxiv上的各种AI前沿论文和相关博客，进而完美地回答学生的问题。\n现在请你阅读以下论文及博客，并回答学生的问题。\n\n### 论文信息\n###  1. 论文标题\n```\nDeciphering Digital Detectives: Understanding LLM Behaviors and Capabilities in Multi-Agent Mystery Games\n```\n#### 2. 论文摘要\n```\nIn this study, we explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in\n\\textit{Jubensha}, a Chinese detective role-playing game and a novel area in\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) driven gaming.

Tracing their origins to 19th-\ncentury murder mystery novels and early 20th-\ncentury party puzzles, these games have particu-\nlarly flourished in China in recent years. In this con-\ntext, they are referred to as \"Jubensha\", \"Scripted\nMurders\" or 剧本杀in Chinese, and have experi-\nenced a remarkable surge in popularity since the\nlate 2010s. Influenced by Western murder mystery\ngames, Jubensha games center around players who\ngather to identify the murderer by analyzing and\ninterpreting the provided story scripts.

It requires\nplayers to interact with each other and reason about who\nis the murderer in a story.\nfor players to collect and interpret clues through\nintense social interaction and reasoning has made\nplaying Jubensha stand out as a notable cultural\nphenomenon.\nMeanwhile, the field of Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) is reshaping the gaming landscape. From\nclassic games like chess (Campbell et al., 2002),\nGo (Silver et al., 2016), and poker (Brown and\nSandholm, 2019; Brown et al., 2020) to video\ngames like StarCraft (Vinyals et al., 2017, 2019),\nLeague of Legends (Lohokare et al., 2020), and\nHonor of Kings (Ye et al., 2020), AI contenders\nor collaborators have been integrated into these\ngames. The recent surge in Large Language Mod-\nels (LLMs) has redirected research interest from\nconventional and video games to text-based games.\nSignificant examples include an LLM deployed as\nagents in the strategic game CICERO (FAIR et al.,\n2022), in the communicative game Werewolf (Xu\net al., 2023), and in the text-based adventure game\nZork (Tsai et al., 2023).\nHowever, the “Jubensha game” remains an un-\ndeveloped field in terms of AI agents specifically\n1\narXiv:2312.00746v2  [cs.AI]  29 Feb 2024\ntailored for its gameplay and evaluation. We be-\nlieve there are several reasons. First, before the\nemergence of LLMs, understanding the character\nplots, role tasks, and game rules in the script of\nJubensha games was very challenging. Not to men-\ntion the need for AI agents to engage in multi-round\nlinguistic interactions, information gathering, and\nlogical reasoning. Second, currently there is no\npublicly available dataset specifically for Jubensha\ngames that researchers can use to develop and eval-\nuate their agents. Third, quantitatively and qual-\nitatively automating the evaluation of AI agents’\nperformance in Jubensha games is also very dif-\nficult. The most commonly used win-rate metric\nin other game AIs is also of limited use in assess-\ning the performance of Jubensha game agents, i.e.,\nwin rate does not show the extent of the Jubensha\nAI’s mastery of case information or the level of its\nreasoning ability.\nIn response to the above-mentioned challenges,\nwe attempt to provide a solution in this work. This\nwork focuses on constructing a multi-agent interac-\ntion framework in a “Jubensha” game environment\nusing large language models, and we have designed\na set of methods to quantitatively and qualitatively\nassess the performance of Large Language Model\nbased (LLM-based) agents. Our contributions can\nbe summarized as follows:\n1. We have created a Chinese dataset providing\ncharacter scripts and preset game rules to ini-\ntiate a Jubensha game. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first dataset specifically\ntailored for AI agents playing in a Jubensha\ngame setting.\n2. We designed a framework for multi-agent in-\nteraction in a Jubensha game environment us-\ning large language models, allowing multiple\nLLM-based agents to autonomously interact\nwith each other in a Jubensha game setting,\nwithout the need for human intervention.\n3. To quantitatively and qualitatively assess the\nperformance of large language model based\nagents in Jubensha games, we designed two\nnovel tasks: one to evaluate their mastery of\ncase information and another to assess their\nreasoning abilities with the information col-\nlected during the game.\n4. Utilizing the latest advancements in the field\nof in-context learning, we devised modules\nto enhance the performance of LLM-based\nagents. Our evaluations show that this de-\nsign significantly enhances the information\nmastery, murderer identification, and reason-\ning capabilities of LLM-based agents in the\nJubensha game context.\n2\nRelated Work\nInteractive Role-Playing Games\nIRPGs provide\nimmersive experiences in fictional settings, serving\nas a multidisciplinary research testbed in various\nfields (Zagal and Deterding, 2018; Barreteau et al.,\n2003; Nagata et al., 2021). These games are cate-\ngorized into SRPGs and MRPGs, each with unique\nresearch opportunities. SRPGs focus on character\nadvancement through quests in various themes (In-\nfocom, 1980; Côté et al., 2019; Szot et al., 2021;\nFan et al., 2022; Shridhar et al., 2020; Wang et al.,\n2022a). While MRPGs highlight collaborative sto-\nrytelling (Lai et al., 2023; Park et al., 2023; Fu\net al., 2023; Kramár et al., 2022; FAIR et al.,\n2022). This work presents a dataset for MRPG\nJubensha, aimed at supporting studies on the de-\nvelopment and evaluation of communicative and\nreasoning AI in an adversarial game setting.\nLLM-based Autonomous Agents.\nThanks to\ntheir strong capabilities in language comprehen-\nsion and reasoning, LLMs have demonstrated sig-\nnificant potential for achieving impressive perfor-\nmance in tasks that focus on advancing charac-\nters. (Wang et al., 2023a; Wei et al., 2022; Wang\net al., 2022b; Yao et al., 2023, 2022; Shinn et al.,\n2023). However, only a few works explore the\nmulti-agent interaction under complex settings (Xu\net al., 2023; Junprung, 2023; Lai et al., 2023). To\nbridge the gap, we propose the first LLM-based\nmulti-agent interaction framework on Jubensha, al-\nlowing autonomous agent engaging and facilitating\nfurther study on advanced study topics.\nEvaluating LLM-based Agents.\nDespite the\nquick development of LLM-based agents, assess-\ning their abilities in MRPGs can still be essential\nand challenging. Recent initiatives (Wang et al.,\n2023b; Shao et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2023; Xu\net al., 2023) propose several simple subjective and\nobjective evaluation metrics for LLM-based agents\nunder multi-role settings. However, it can still be\nchallenging to assess the capabilities of LLM-based\nagents for MRPGs using simple evaluation metrics,\nsuch as win rate. To address this issue, we pro-\npose a set of systematic and objective evaluation\n2\nmethods designed to measure the information gath-\nering and reasoning abilities of LLM-based agents\nin Jubensha.\n3\nJubensha Dataset\nText\nImage\nAudio\nVideo\nTotal\n#\n1115\n643\n392\n172\n1115\nTable 1: Number of Jubensha game scripts by modality\nin our dataset.\nPlayers\nTokens\nmin\nmax\navg\nmin\nmax\navg\n#\n1\n20\n6.52\n4k\n518k\n129k\nTable 2: Statics on number of players and tokens for the\nJubensha game scripts in our dataset.\nTo enhance AI deployment in Jubensha games,\nwe have compiled a comprehensive dataset from\nover 1,100 Jubensha game instances in Chinese.1\nThis dataset is a valuable addition to MRPG re-\nsearch, presenting unique challenges and opportu-\nnities for advancement. 2\nBackground of Jubensha Game\nJubensha is a\ndetective role-playing game with multiple players,\nwhere each player is assigned a unique role tied to\na central murder mystery. As shown in Figure 1,\nthe game process typically consists of six stages: 1)\nEach player selects a script for distinct characters\nin a Jubensha game. 2) Players are assigned with\na role (murderer or civilian) associated with their\nselected scripts. 3) The players read their scripts to\ndevelop a basic understanding of the whole story\nfrom their views. 4) Each player is given a pool\nof clues to help them reveal or hide critical de-\ntails for finding the murderer. 5) Several rounds\nof group discussion are held among the players to\nshare information and find out the murderer. 6).\nFinally, each player anonymously votes to decide\nthe murderer. The civilians win the game if the\ntrue murderer gets the most votes, otherwise, the\nmurderer wins.\nDataset Construction\nTo establish an environ-\nment capable of evaluating Jubensha agents and to\nfacilitate future scaled-up works, we collect 1,115\ninstances of Jubensha games in Chinese online.\n1Currently, this dataset is in Chinese, but we are open to\nexpanding it to other languages in the future. We use English\nexamples in the main text for the convenience of the readers.\n2We will release this dataset post-acceptance for academic\npurposes only.\nEach game consists of a host manual describing\nhow to control the game process and a God’s-eye\nview of case replays, along with individual scripts\nfor each character in the game. As demonstrated\nin Table 2, the number of players can vary from 1\nto 20, and the number of tokens for the game can\nbe as large as 518k, facilitating further research on\nsocially intelligent AI and introducing extra-long\ntext comprehension and reasoning challenges. Be-\nsides, as shown in Table 1, some of these scripts\nalso contain multimodal clues, including audio and\nvideo. To create a unified experimental environ-\nment, this work concentrates exclusively on text-\nmodality Jubensha games.\n4\nThe ThinkThrice Framework for\nJubensha Games\nWe have designed an interaction framework for\nLLM-based agents specifically crafted for Juben-\nsha games. In this framework, each LLM-based\nagent is responsible for playing the role of a player\nin the Jubensha game narrative. Typically, each\nJubensha game involves 4-5 players portrayed by\nLLM-based agents. Besides, we have a non-player\ncharacter serving as the host, who is responsible\nfor guiding the game. Unlike other players driven\nby large language models, the host’s questions and\ncommands are pre-set to ensure the game follows\na designated process. As for the LLM-based agent\nplayers, they are embedded with character informa-\ntion specific to their roles. Based on this informa-\ntion, they interact with other characters including\nother players and the host. These interactions are\nsynchronous, meaning only one agent acts at a spe-\ncific moment. All actions of the LLM-based agent\nplayers, such as whom to question or how to re-\nspond to questions from other players or the host,\nare generated by an LLM based on their character\nscripts and historical chat records, as shown in Fig-\nure 2. Moreover, we have also set a finite number\nof rounds for each game to mimic the time-limited\nrules of real Jubensha games. Although currently\nfocusing on Jubensha, our framework design is\nflexible, potentially requiring minimal adjustments\nfor application in other contexts.\nWe name our framework for multi-agent mystery\ngames as ThinkThrice, or 三思in Chinese. The\nname comes from a Chinese proverb: “thinking\nthrice before acting (三思而后行)”. Figure 2 illus-\ntrates the overall design of our ThinkThrice frame-\nwork, which outlines the process by which a player\n3\nLLM\n       Question (Q): Please ﬁrst introduce your role, then talk about the victim of the case \nyou are aware of: what kind of person is Boss Yang, and what is your relationship with \nhim.

The three different colors of the arrows indicate the data flows of three stages: 1)\nInitial answer generation with Memory Retrieval; 2) Enhance answer with Self-Refinement; 3) Verify answer with\nSelf-Verification. The brown texts in the refined answer are new information added to the initial answer.\ngenerates a response to a question through three\nmain stages: Memory Retrieval, Self-Refinement,\nand Self-Verification.\nMemory Retrieval\nDue to the limited context\nwindow of LLMs, a special memory retrieval mod-\nule is often needed to store and appropriately re-\ntrieve all historical records observed by LLM-based\nagents (Park et al., 2023; Lai et al., 2023). Our\nframework adopts this widely used method to help\nagents remember dialogues and events in the Juben-\nsha games and retrieve specific memory fragments\nwhen needed. Specifically, we record all observa-\ntions of the agent into a vector database exclusive\nto the agent using the OpenAI API (OpenAI, 2023).\nWhen the agent observes a new event requiring ac-\ntion, we use the Faiss library3 to quickly search\nthe agent’s exclusive vector database for multiple\nhistorical records with the top 5 highest similari-\nties and include them in the current action prompt.\nWe have observed that this simple module is also\nvery helpful in improving the performance of LLM-\nbased agents in our Jubensha games.\nSelf-Refinement\nThe\ngoal\nof\nthe\nSelf-\nRefinement module is to ensure that LLM-based\nagents provide as much information and details\nas possible when responding to questions from\nothers.\nAs shown in Figure 2, when an agent\n3https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/faiss\nreceives a question from others, it first attempts\nto generate an initial answer internally (see the\ngreen lines). During the Self-Refinement stage,\nthe agent decomposes the asked question Q into\nseveral sub-questions: q1, q2, . . . , qn. It then uses\nthese sub-questions to retrieve relevant facts from\nthe character scripts S that can be used to answer\nthese sub-questions. For each relevant fact, the\nagent checks whether they are included in the\ninitial answer. If not, they are added to form part\nof the refined answer (see the orange lines in\nFigure 2). We can see that the refined answer, after\nthe Self-Refinement module, contains more details\nand information than the initial answer, thereby\nenhancing the agent’s communication efficiency\nwithin a limited number of rounds.\nSelf-Verification\nLLM hallucinations are a very\ncommon and thorny problem (Dhuliawala et al.,\n2023). To ensure that the content of LLM-based\nagents’ answers is authentic and not hallucinated,\nwe designed a Self-Verification module. This mod-\nule breaks down the agent’s answer A into multiple\nfacts a1, a2, . . . , an and then compares these facts\none by one with the agent’s character script S for\nauthenticity. Only when the agent’s answer meets\nour preset authenticity threshold (measured by the\nabsolute number and accuracy of real facts) will\nthe agent output the answer (see the blue lines in\nFigure 2). If the answer does not meet the preset\n4\nthreshold, the agent will need to regenerate the an-\nswer until the authenticity of the agent’s answer\nmeets the requirements or exceeds the maximum\nnumber of attempts. Since the agent’s best output\nmay not necessarily occur in the last attempt, we\nscore each answer based on the degree of authen-\nticity and the number of words, keeping a copy of\nthe highest-scoring answer each time. By doing\nso, we can ensure that even if all of the agent’s\nattempts fail to meet the authenticity threshold, it\nwill still output the highest quality answer from all\nits previous attempts.\n5\nEvaluating LLM-based Agents in\nJubensha Games\nPrevious work has primarily employed metrics\nsuch as human-likeness and win rate to assess the\nperformance of LLM-based agents in games (Wang\net al., 2023a; Lai et al., 2023). These metrics either\nrequire substantial human involvement or likely\nleading to less reliable experimental conclusions\ndue to the challenges in controlling variables (Lai\net al., 2023).4 Considering the unique character-\nistics of Jubensha games, we have designed two\ntasks to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate\nthe performance of LLM-based agents in Jubensha\ngames: Factual Question Answering and Inferen-\ntial Question Answering.\nFactual Question Answering\nThe process of\ngathering information in Jubensha games is crucial\nfor LLM-based agents to understand the implied\nrelationships and conflicts in the story, reconstruct\nthe entire case, and deduce the truth. To evaluate\nhow much information LLM-based agents gathered\nin Jubensha games, we designed a factual question-\nanswering task and use GPTs to generate questions.\nWe have generated a total of 720 factual questions\nfor 4 selected Jubensha games containing 4 or 5\nplayers, of which two examples are presented in\nTable 3. Due to limited space, we have included\nthe prompts of our generation method in the ap-\npendix H.\nInferential Question Answering\nOnce LLM-\nbased agents have gathered the necessary informa-\ntion, another important step is using it for inference.\nThis step is particularly crucial in Jubensha games,\nwhere the truth of the case is often obscured by\nnumerous clues. To evaluate the reasoning abili-\n4This is particularly the case when both sides in the game\nare played by LLMs\nExample 1\nQuestion: Who does Mate Zhang’s brother\nwork for?\nAnswer: Boss Yang\nSource: He works for Boss Yang, owner of\na famous bar in City A.

Therefore, it can be\ninferred that {the ’thumping’ sound Dr. Ling\nheard on her way to kill Boss Yang was most\nlikely made by Secretary Wen}CONCLUSION.\nTable 4: Example of Inferential Questions.\nties of LLM-based agents, we manually designed\na total of 56 inferential questions for 4 selected\nJubensha games, of which an example is shown in\nTable 4. Note that the PREMISE 1 is from Secre-\ntary Wen’s script and the PREMISE 2 is from Dr.\nLing’s script. To answer these questions success-\nfully, LLM-based agents must integrate informa-\ntion collected from different characters and make\ninferences based on this information.\n6\nExperiment\nIn this section, we will briefly discuss the various\nLLMs used in this work. Following this, we will\npresent our experimental results, encompassing the\nevaluation of the information gathering and reason-\ning performance of LLM-based agents.\n5\nOwn Q\nOther’s Q\nAvg\nCQ\nMQ\nAvg\nNo MR\n0.770\n0.300\n0.321\n0.305\nMR\n0.759\n0.409\n0.380\n0.402\nMR+SR\n0.757\n0.467\n0.487\n0.471\nMR+SR+SV(N=1)\n0.768\n0.485\n0.518\n0.492\nMR+SR+SV(N=3)\n0.772\n0.495\n0.514\n0.498\nTable 5: Performance of agents on different kinds of fac-\ntual questions. “Own Q” refers to questions generated\nfrom the agent’s own script, while “Other’s Q” refers to\nquestions from scripts of other agents, inaccessible to\nthe answering agent. “Other’s Q” includes “CQ” (ques-\ntions from other civilians’ scripts) and “MQ” (questions\nfrom the murderer agent’s script).

Unless specifically indicated, the GPT-\n3.5 and the GPT-4 model mentioned in this paper\nrefer to gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613 and gpt-4-1106-\npreview respectively. For text embedding we used\ntext-embedding-ada-002 for gameplay and text-\nembedding-3-large for evaluation. More specific\nusages of GPT models are listed in the appendix B.\n6.2\nEvaluation on Agents’ Responses to\nFactual Questions\nThe Table 5 presents the evaluation results on\nagents’ responses to factual questions. We can\nsee that agents with different module combinations\nperformed quite well when answering questions\nfrom their own script. This is understandable be-\ncause agents have full access to their own scripts\nthroughout the game, thereby possessing all the\ninformation needed to correctly answer these ques-\ntions. Since the Memory Retriever (MR) module\nmainly records the communication history among\nagents after the game starts, we can consider agents\nwithout the Memory Retriever as being in a mem-\noryless state. The experimental results in the “No\nMR” row show that agents’ accuracy in answering\nquestions about themselves is significantly higher\nthan in answering questions about others. This gap\nhighlights the significant difference between the\ninformation agents possess about others and about\nthemselves. After introducing the MR module,\nwe observe a significant improvement in agents’\naccuracy in answering questions about others, re-\nflecting the increase in information gained from\ninteractions among agents, which helps them better\nunderstand the roles and stories of other characters\nin the game.\nThe Self-Refinement (SR) and Self-Verification\n(SV) modules mainly ensure the authenticity and\ncomprehensiveness of information during agent\ncommunication. We can observe that the accu-\nracy of agents in answering questions about others\nachieves the best results among all under the com-\nbined effect of the MR module, the SR module, and\nthe SV module (with a maximum of 3 attempts).\nThis demonstrates that our designed modules ef-\nfectively enhance the efficiency of communication\namong agents in the Jubensha game, allowing them\nto acquire more case information under the same\ngame round conditions.\n6.3\nSimilarities between Agent Chat Histories\nand All Players’ Scripts\nTo measure the overall information about all char-\nacters acquired by LLM-based agents in the game\nfrom the textual perspective, we employed three\nmethods to assess the similarities between the chat\nhistories among agents and the scripts of all play-\ners. Firstly, we concatenate all players’ scripts\ninto a single document, then we treat the chat his-\ntories among agents as another document. Then\nwe used OpenAI API (OpenAI, 2023) to encode\nthese two documents respectively. For documents\nbeyond OpenAI API’s max input length, we split\nthem into non-overlapping chunks, average their\ntext embeddings to represent the document. Given\nembeddings of two documents, their cosine simi-\nlarity can be calculated. Additionally, we utilized\nTF-IDF and trigrams to represent the two docu-\nments, and then calculated their cosine and Jaccard\n6\nNo MR\nMR\nMR+SR\nMR+SR+\nSV(N=1)\nMR+SR+\nSV(N=3)\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n0.183\n0.183\n0.225\n0.233\n0.383\n0.191\n0.253\n0.224\n0.283\n0.344\nCivilian Win Rate\nMurderer Identification Accuracy\nFigure 3: Average win rate of civilian players and the\naverage murderer identification accuracy across differ-\nent architectures in Jubensha games.\nsimilarities, respectively. The results from Table 6\nshow that agents embedded with MR, SR, and SV\nmodules have chat histories in the game that are\ncloser to the scripts of all players, which demon-\nstrates that they have acquired more information\nabout all players in a Jubensha game.\n6.4\nCivilian Player Win Rate and Murderer\nIdentification Accuracy\nFigure 3 shows the average win rates of civilian\nplayers and the murderer identification accuracy\nby agents with various module combinations in\nJubensha games. Civilian win rate in Figure 3 is\nthe ratio of the number of games won by civilian\nplayers to the total number of games played. Mur-\nderer identification accuracy is the proportion of\nvotes received by the murderer to the total num-\nber of votes cast by all players. We observed that\nMR+SR+SV(N=3) which performs best in factual\nquestion answering tasks, also achieves the high-\nest average civilian players win rate and murderer\nidentification accuracy. This might be due to agents\nacquiring sufficient information to reconstruct the\ntrue narrative of the case, thereby making it easier\nto accurately identify the murderer.\n6.5\nEvaluation of Agent’s Responses to\nInferential Questions\nTo further evaluate the reasoning capabilities of\nLLM-based agents based on the rationale derived\nfrom collected information, we utilized a set of\ninferential questions. The experimental results are\ndisplayed in Figure 4, where the Overall Accuracy\nrepresents the rate at which agents correctly answer\nquestions, without considering the rationale behind\ntheir responses. In contrast, Informed Accuracy\nrefers to the accuracy achieved when taking into\naccount the rationale provided by agents for their\nanswers. An answer is counted towards Informed\nAccuracy only if the agent’s response is correct and\nNo MR\nMR\nMR+SR\nMR+SR+\nSV (N=1)\nMR+SR+\nSV (N=3)\nFSA\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.056\n0.075\n0.113\n0.136\n0.121\n0.205\n0.106\n0.104\n0.155\n0.181\n0.165\n0.257\n0.137\n0.237\n0.319\n0.342\n0.395\n0.624\n0.194\n0.287\n0.38\n0.385\n0.446\n0.654\nInformed Accuracy (GPT-3.5)\nOverall Accuracy (GPT-3.5)\nInformed Accuracy (GPT-4)\nOverall Accuracy (GPT-4)\nFigure 4: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4’s performance with dif-\nferent methods, where overall accuracy measure the raw\ncorrect percentage and informed accuracy take LLM’s\nreasoning ability into consideration. FSA stands for\n’Full Script Access’, indicating that agents have access\nto the complete scripts of all players.\nthey provide the correct reasoning rationale. This\nmetric demonstrates that agents not only know the\ncorrect answer but also understand why it is correct.\nFrom the results in Figure 4, we can draw two\nimportant observations: 1) The more information\nagents acquire during the game, the more capable\nthey become at solving complex problems through\nreasoning. For instance, when GPT-4 is employed,\nthe agent with full access to all players’ scripts\nachieves the highest overall accuracy and informed\naccuracy. Following this, agents equipped with\nMR+SR+SV(N=3) modules rank second. 2) Given\nthe same amount of information, the LLMs’ inher-\nent ability to utilize this information and reason ef-\nfectively determines the agents’ final performance\nin reasoning tasks. Indeed, simply upgrading from\nGPT-3.5 to GPT-4 can lead to agents achieving dou-\nble or even nearly triple the overall accuracy and\ninformed accuracy.\nQualitative Analysis.\nIn Table 7, we provide a\nqualitative analysis: agents are presented with an\ninferential question and the correct answer which\nthe agents do not know to be correct, and are asked\nto provide the rationale for their reasoning. Each\nrationale provided by the agents is accompanied by\na GPT Eval Score, which measures the similarity\nbetween the agents’ rationale and the ground truth\nrationale.

Our research has yielded four\nmain contributions: the creation of a specialized\ndataset tailored for the Jubensha games, the de-\nsign of a multi-agent interaction framework for\nthe automatic conduct of Jubensha games, the de-\nvelopment of a set of quantitative and qualitative\nassessment methods to measure the information\ngathering and reasoning abilities of LLM-based\nagents within the game, and the utilization of the\nlatest in-context learning techniques to devise mod-\nules that enhance the performance of LLM-based\nagents. We have empirically demonstrated that our\ndesigned multi-agent interaction framework and\nthe in-context learning modules significantly im-\nprove upon the baseline in terms of information\ngathering, murderer identification, and reasoning\ncapabilities. We believe this research will advance\nthe community’s knowledge of LLM-based agents\n8\nand offers a new perspective on evaluating the\nperformance of LLMs in a complex, plot-driven,\nand adversarial reasoning game environment con-\nstrained by narrative contexts.\nEthical Considerations\nOur research delves into the communicative and\nreasoning abilities of large language models\n(LLMs) within the context of \"Jubensha\" (剧本\n杀), a type of Chinese detective role-playing game.\nIt is important to clarify that any portrayals of vio-\nlence in these game scenarios are purely fictional,\nand our work is solely for the purposes of aca-\ndemic analysis. It does not represent or endorse\nreal-world violence in any way. The data employed\nin our study is gathered from online platforms host-\ning Jubensha content. When sharing this dataset,\nwe will implement measures to ensure that its us-\nage remains strictly for academic, non-commercial\npurposes and complies with fair use policies. 5\nLimitations\nWe outline the main limitations of our work as\nfollows:\n• Language Specificity of the Dataset: Our\nJubensha dataset is in Chinese, which means\nour experimental results are specifically re-\nflective of the communicative and reasoning\ncapabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)\nbased agents in Chinese contexts. Consid-\nering that the majority of LLM evaluation\nbenchmarks are in English, and existing LLM-\nbased agent frameworks are tailored for En-\nglish applications, our Chinese-centric bench-\nmark and framework could provide a valuable\naddition to the field.\n• Variability in Experimental Outcomes: The\ninherent stochastic nature of LLM outputs\nmay lead to significant variability in single-\nexperiment results. For instance, in the mur-\nderer identification voting phase, LLM-driven\nplayers may choose differently among sus-\npects if given another chance. Similarly, game\nprocesses can diverge significantly, even with\nidentical starting conditions. To mitigate this,\nwe conducted three runs of each Jubensha\n5https:\/\/www.copyright.gov\/fair-use\/index.\nhtml\nhttps:\/\/www.gov.cn\/guoqing\/2021-10\/29\/content_\n5647633.htm\ngame script with LLM-based agents for each\nproposed architectures and averaged the out-\ncomes. For highly variable tasks like murderer\nidentification, agents performed 10 memory-\nless votes, from which we calculated identifi-\ncation accuracy and civilian win rates. How-\never, due to time and budget constraints, fur-\nther experiments to solidify these results were\nnot feasible. We will make our code, dataset,\nand all intermediate results available post-\nacceptance, including chat histories, voting\nrecords, agents’ responses to factual and in-\nferential questions, and GPT models’ evalu-\nations on these responses, to help interested\nreaders replicate our experiments and better\nunderstand our findings.\n• Model Updates and Replication Costs: Re-\nproducing our findings might be challeng-\ning due to OpenAI’s periodic model updates,\nwhich can lead to different results with dif-\nferent model versions. To address this, we\nspecify the exact version of GPT used in each\nexperiment in the appendix B and will publish\nour code post-acceptance. Moreover, the cost\nof replicating our experiments can be costly.\nWe aim to alleviate this by providing an illus-\ntrative cost breakdown for each experimental\nstep in the appendix D, helping readers gauge\npotential expenses before attempting replica-\ntion.\n```\n\n#### 5. 学生问题\n问题1：介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」\n问题2：这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？\n问题3：这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？\n\n\n请输出论文总结\n### 输出格式（输出语言用中文）\n```\n## 💡 解答问题1 (...复述学生问题1...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (...复述学生问题2...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (...复述学生问题3...)\n...\n```\n","llm_summary_res":"## 🌟 论文解读 | 解码数字侦探：理解大型语言模型在多智能体推理游戏中的行为和能力\n\n## 📌 背景痛点\/本文动机\n随着互动角色扮演游戏（IRPGs）的全球流行，特别是中国侦探角色扮演游戏“剧本杀”（Jubensha）的兴起，人工智能（AI）在游戏领域的应用也日益受到关注。然而，现有的AI研究主要集中在传统的棋类游戏、视频游戏等领域，对于“剧本杀”这类需要多轮语言交互、信息收集和逻辑推理的游戏，AI的应用还处于起步阶段。本文旨在探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在“剧本杀”游戏中的应用，并建立一个新的评估基准，以衡量LLM在复杂叙事环境中的能力。\n\n## 🚀 核心方法\n💡 创新点1：构建了首个专门针对“剧本杀”游戏的中文数据集，包括角色剧本和预设游戏规则，为AI代理的开发提供了基础。\n💡 创新点2：设计了一个独特的多智能体交互框架，使用LLMs使AI代理能够自主参与“剧本杀”游戏。\n💡 创新点3：为了评估AI代理在“剧本杀”游戏中的表现，设计了两个新颖的任务：一个用于评估他们对案件信息的掌握程度，另一个用于评估他们的推理能力。\n💡 创新点4：利用最新的上下文学习技术，设计了模块来增强LLM代理在信息收集、凶手识别和逻辑推理方面的性能。\n\n## 📈 实验结果\n实验结果表明，本文提出的方法在信息收集、凶手识别和推理能力方面显著提高了LLM代理的性能。具体来说，与没有记忆检索模块的代理相比，具有记忆检索模块的代理在回答关于其他角色的问题时准确率显著提高。此外，自完善和自验证模块的组合进一步提高了代理的准确率，表明这些模块有效地增强了代理在“剧本杀”游戏中的沟通效率。\n\n## 💬 可借鉴之处\n本文的研究为LLMs在复杂叙事环境中的应用提供了新的视角，并为评估LLM代理的性能建立了新的基准。此外，本文提出的ThinkThrice框架和上下文学习模块的设计，为开发更智能、更具推理能力的AI代理提供了有价值的参考。","llm_summary_res_status":200,"order":18,"query_answer":"## 💡 解答问题1 (介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」)\n\n这篇论文提出了一个名为“剧本杀”的中文侦探角色扮演游戏数据集，该数据集包括角色剧本和预设游戏规则，旨在为AI代理的开发提供基础。此外，论文还设计了一个独特的多智能体交互框架，使用LLMs使AI代理能够自主参与“剧本杀”游戏。为了评估AI代理在“剧本杀”游戏中的表现，论文设计了两个新颖的任务：一个用于评估他们对案件信息的掌握程度，另一个用于评估他们的推理能力。这两个任务构成了论文提出的benchmark，用于衡量LLM在复杂叙事环境中的能力。\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？)\n\n论文中并未明确提及benchmark所需的设备条件，但根据论文内容，我们可以推测，由于LLMs的训练和推理需要大量的计算资源，因此该benchmark可能需要高性能的计算机设备，例如具有多个GPU和大量内存的服务器。至于本文的模型训练和推理所使用的设备，论文中提到使用了OpenAI的GPT-3.5和GPT-4模型，但没有具体说明这些模型的训练和推理所使用的设备。\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？)\n\n论文中并未提及benchmark是否具有高质量的结果奖励或过程奖励，以及是否支持RL类模型。然而，根据论文内容，我们可以推测，由于“剧本杀”游戏是一个复杂的叙事环境，需要多轮语言交互、信息收集和逻辑推理，因此该benchmark可能更适合评估LLM在复杂环境中的能力，而不是RL类模型。","query_answer_status":200}

Our code is available\nat https:\/\/github.com\/eric-ai-lab\/llm coordination.\n1\nIntroduction\nIn a wide range of activities, from daily tasks such as cooking to critical operations like rescue\nefforts, cooperation without mixed intentions is essential. These scenarios are examples\nof Pure Coordination Games, where all involved parties benefit from choosing strategies\nthat are perfectly aligned, avoiding any conflict of interest. These games require agents\nto reason about their environment and plan while considering the beliefs and intentions\nof their partners. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent\nplanning abilities in both physical and virtual settings (Raman et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023;\nWu et al., 2023), impressive reasoning capabilities (Wei et al., 2022), and the hints of a Theory\nof Mind (Kosinski, 2023) making them promising candidates for developing coordination\nagents. Previous works have explored the use of LLMs for developing collaborative agents,\nyet the requisite conditions, strengths, and limitations of LLMs in coordination games\nremain unclear. In this study, we intend to bridge the gap by performing a comprehensive\nevaluation and analysis of the multi-agent coordination abilities of LLMs.\nTherefore, we introduce a new LLM-Coordination Benchmark featuring two task settings\nfor pure coordination games: 1. Agentic Coordination and 2. CoordinationQA. In Agentic\nCoordination, LLMs are scaffolded with components that allow them to act within actual\ngame environments, providing a holistic evaluation of the competencies of LLMs to act as\ncoordination agents. In CoordinationQA, LLMs have to answer a curated set of questions\nabout edge-case scenarios drawn from coordination games where agents are required\nactively cooperate with their partners. The benchmark includes four collaborative games,\nproviding a comprehensive analysis platform.\nTo enable LLMs for multi-agent coordination, we present a Cognitive Architecture for\nCoordination (CAC) framework that facilitates LLM interaction with game environments in\na plug-and-play approach. CAC translates game elements into textual formats and leverages\nauxiliary LLMs for improved coordination to enable effective multi-agent collaboration.\nOur Experiments on the Agentic Coordination task with CAC reveal that Large Language\nModels are capable of understanding the game objectives, generating coherent reasoning\nfor their next actions, and coordinating with partners across all coordination games. They\nexhibit these competencies without any training, fine-tuning, or few-shot examples.\nA comparative analysis on the Agentic Coordination task reveals that LLM agents outper-\nform Multi-agent RL solutions in games that require minimum theory-of-mind reasoning\nand focus on taking commonsense actions based on the environment. However, they strug-\ngle in more complex settings where agents need to actively consider their partner’s beliefs\nand intentions. We also observe that LLM agents are capable of collaborating with new\npartners, unlike self-play MARL methods (Carroll et al., 2019a; Bard et al., 2020) that fail to\nadapt to unseen agents.\nFor a more nuanced analysis of the coordination abilities of LLMs, we create the Coordi-\nnationQA Suite. This suite is designed to dissect the capabilities of LLMs in single-turn\nreasoning within coordination games, focusing on three key areas: Joint Planning, Theory\nof Mind (ToM), and Environment Comprehension. Joint Planning evaluates LLMs’ decision-\nmaking for optimal long-term outcomes, ToM questions probe the understanding of partner\nagents’ intentions and needs, and Environment Comprehension assesses knowledge of\ngame rules and dynamics. Our findings on CoordinationQA show a marked performance\ngap between GPT-4-turbo and other LLMs across three question types. LLMs are most\nproficient in Environment Comprehension, indicating they understand game rules and\nstates well. However, they face significant challenges in Theory of Mind Reasoning, with\ndifficulty inferring others’ intentions and needs. This issue worsens in Joint Planning,\nwhere most LLMs underperform, some even worse than random choices. These results\nhighlight LLMs’ limited reliability and effectiveness as coordination partners. Additionally,\nour analysis shows a moderate to strong correlation between Theory of Mind Reasoning,\n2\nPreprint\nEnvironment Comprehension, and Joint Planning performance, underscoring their role in\neffective coordination.\nIn summary, our contributions are four-fold:\n1. We introduce the LLM-Coordination Benchmark for evaluating and analyzing LLMs in\nPure Coordination Games, covering multi-turn Agentic Coordination and single-turn\nCoordination QA tasks.\n2. We develop the plug-and-play Cognitive Architecture for Coordination Framework to\nenable LLMs to effectively participate in complex, partially observable coordination\ngames like Hanabi, demonstrating the first zero-shot application for LLM agents in such\nscenarios.\n3. We perform a holistic evaluation of LLM agents in Self-play and Cross-play settings,\noffering a detailed comparison with RL baselines and showcasing their potential as\nCoordination Agents.\n4. We investigate Environment Comprehension and Theory of Mind Reasoning as essen-\ntial components of LLMs’ overall Joint Planning capabilities, highlighting their critical\nimportance in coordination tasks.\n2\nLLM-Coordination Benchmark\n2.1\nMulti-turn Agentic Coordination\nIn the Multi-turn Agentic Coordination task, LLMs participate in end-to-end pure coordi-\nnation games as agents, where the best strategy for all participating agents is to cooperate.\nLLMs under test are plugged into coordination frameworks with components like memory\nmodules and grounding modules to act in complete games. These LLM agents can then be\npartnered with any policies or agents to complete the games.\nOur LLM-Coordination benchmark includes 4 pure coordination games, Hanabi Challenge\n(Bard et al., 2020), Overcooked-AI (Carroll et al., 2019a), Collab Capture and Collab Escape.\nHanabi Challenge: In Hanabi (Bard et al., 2020), players aim to assemble five sequences of\ncards in ascending order (1 through 5). A unique aspect of the game is that the players can\nonly view their partner’s cards, not their own. This requires players to work collaboratively,\nutilizing reveal tokens to provide hints about the cards in their partner’s hand. These hints\ncan be about either the color or the rank of the cards. For instance, using a single hint token,\na player can indicate all cards of a certain rank in their partner’s hand. Hanabi serves as an\nexemplary Pure Coordination game, necessitating player cooperation to achieve optimal\noutcomes. Success in Hanabi hinges on the ability to understand partners’ perspectives,\nnavigate decisions based on incomplete information, and engage in implicit communication,\nmaking it an excellent testing ground for coordination among agents.\nOvercooked-AI: In the Overcooked-AI environment (Carroll et al., 2019a),\ntwo\nagents—Alice (Blue) and Bob (Green)—collaborate to cook and deliver onion soups. This\nenvironment includes a variety of layouts, each with its own arrangement and quantity of\nonion dispensers, plate dispensers, cookers, delivery zones, and countertops. To prepare a\ndish, agents are required to insert three onions into a cooker, initiating a cooking process\nthat lasts 20 time steps. Upon completion, the soup must be plated and delivered to com-\nplete the task. Each layout presents unique challenges, emphasizing the need for agents to\ncomprehend their surroundings, locate necessary resources, and synchronize their actions\nwith their teammate for effective collaboration.\nCollab Capture: Collab Capture involves two agents trying to capture an adversary in a\nmaze of interconnected rooms. The rooms are connected by doors, which can be controlled\nthrough access buttons that can be found in other rooms. The agents’ task is to capture the\nadversary in the least amount of time using effective strategies, including cornering the\nadversary and manipulating the doors to enable their partner or disable the adversary.\n3\nPreprint\nCollab Escape: Collab Escape involves two agents trying to escape an adversary in a maze\nof interconnected rooms. They need to fix two generators (similar to the game Dead-by-\nDaylight (Dea, 2016)) located in different rooms to open an exit portal. The adversary tries\nto catch the agents, and the win condition is any one agent escaping. This game requires\nstrategies like luring the adversary away from the partner, sacrificing for the partner’s safety,\nand manipulating the movement of the adversary.\n2.2\nSingle-turn Coordination QA\nThe agentic coordination task paints a holistic picture of the abilities of LLMs as agents.\nTo dive deeper into the specific strengths and weaknesses of LLMs, we develop the Co-\nordinationQA Suite. Inspired by the idea of Unit Testing for evaluating AI agents Knott\net al. (2021), we manually sampled edge cases from all 4 pure coordination games men-\ntioned in Section 2.1. All of these edge cases necessitate agents to actively understand\ntheir current state, think about their partner’s intentions, and come up with the best plans\nfor coordination. We then create a set of three types of questions for each scenario in our\nCoordinationQA Suite.\n• Environment Comprehension (EC) questions require LLMs to make indirect inferences\nabout some aspect of their environment.\n• Theory of Mind Reasoning (ToM) questions challenge the LLMs to predict the intentions\nof their partners and probe about the requirements of their partners.\n• Joint Planning (JP) questions provide agents with the state\/observation and ask them\nto predict the best next action for effective coordination. This question is essentially the\nsame question that LLMs need to repeatedly solve when they act as agents.\nAll the questions were manually developed and labeled. We filtered out questions and\nscenarios that showed any ambiguity, leaving only questions that had clear optimal solutions.\nWe generated a total of N=66 scenarios (25 from Overcooked, 28 from Hanabi, and 13\nfrom the two Collab Games) and created 3 questions per scenario, resulting in 198 unique\nquestions. The right side of Figure 1 demonstrates the sampling process for the three types\nof questions with an example from the game Overcooked. The selected scenario shows the\nBlue agent about to place their third onion in the cooker, and the green agent needs to figure\nout what to do next.\n3\nCognitive Architecture for Coordination\nWe develop a LLM Agent architecture based on Sumers et al. (2023), which we dub Cognitive\nArchitecture for Coordination (CAC), for multi-agent coordination. Using CAC we can\neasily plug and play a LLM agent, and pair it with any partner (e.g., another CAC agent, a\nhuman player, or other AI agents). The architecture consists of three key elements: Memory,\nReasoning, and Grounding.\nMemory Module includes (1) Long-Term Memory for storing the Game Description includ-\ning the game’s rules, conventions, objectives and action space, (2) Working memory which\nconsists a textual description of the current observation, and (3) Episodic Memory which is\na list of previous actions selected by the agent. In the example shown in Figure 2 the Long\nTerm Memory includes a description of the game of Hanabi, The Working memory includes\nobservations including the current stack, partner’s hand, beliefs and knowledge of both\nagents and information regarding the available tokens, and cards, and the Episodic Memory\nincludes the previously selected discards, plays and hints.\nReasoning Module is where the Large Language Model (LLM) is plugged into the frame-\nwork. It takes the textual description in the working memory as input and generates the next\nbest action based on the context. For coordination games like Hanabi that require a more\nsophisticated Theory of Mind reasoning, we add an auxiliary Theory of Mind Reasoning\nLLM whose sole responsibility is to interpret the partner agent’s actions and requirements.\nThis extra reasoning is added to the working memory before passing to the primary LLM.\nAdditionally, we also utilize a Self-verification LLM which verifies the safety of the selected\n4\nPreprint\nFigure 2: Cognitive Architecture for Coordination (CAC). This framework is segmented\ninto three key components for agentic analysis—Memory, which archives the game descrip-\ntion and current game state; Grounding, which involves the execution of actions selected\nby LLMs; and Reasoning, which encompasses a Theory of Mind (ToM) inference LLM, a\nverifier LLM, and the primary LLM under analysis.\naction. In the Hanabi example in Figure 2, the reasoning module interprets the provided\nclue of ”Revealing Rank 1 Cards” and decides to play one of the pointed cards on the empty\nstacks. The generated action is passed to the grounding module.\nGrounding Module is responsible for interfacing the reasoning and memory modules’\ntextual decision-making spaces with the actual game mechanics. Its primary task is to\ntake the selected action from the reasoning module and translate it into game-compatible\naction(s). The exact implementation of the grounding module depends on the game in\nquestion; for example, in Overcooked-AI, the grounding module needs to convert high-level\nactions like ”pick up onion from o0.” into sequences of lower-level actions. On the other\nhand, in games like Hanabi, it just needs to match actions like ”Reveal Bob’s Red Color\nCards” to their lower-level representations. The grounding module is also responsible for\nthe secondary task of filtering out infeasible actions based on the context of the game.\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nAgentic Coordination\n4.1.1\nSetup\nWe perform two types of experiments in agentic coordination: Self-Play and Cross-Play. In\nself-play settings, the participating agents are of the same type. In Cross-Play experiments,\nwe pair agents with unseen partners, and they need to adapt their behavior to the actions of\nthese new partners.\nSelf-play Baselines: For Overcooked we use Proximal Policy Optimization (Schulman et al.,\n2017) and Population-Based Training (Jaderberg et al., 2017) as baselines for comparison.\nThese baselines were established by Carroll et al. (2019a). The Hanabi challenge has been\nextensively studied and solved using MARL methods. We use Bayesian Action Decoder\n(Bard et al., 2020), Simplified Action Decoder (Hu & Foerster, 2021), and Off-Belief Learning\n(Hu et al., 2021a) as baselines.\n5\nPreprint\nCross-play Baselines: For Overcooked, we use a Behavior Cloning model trained on human\ndata Carroll et al. (2019a) and a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent trained with\nthe Human Behavior Cloning agent Carroll et al. (2019a) as baselines for comparison. We\nalso use human proxies based on behavior cloning as unseen partners. For Hanabi, we use\nthe Simplified Action Decoder (SAD) as a baseline. We pair our agents with the Off-Belief\nLearning (Hu et al., 2021a), which was trained to generate grounded policies and adapt to\nunseen partner agents.\nMetrics: We measure the total score achieved by agents in Overcooked, where each delivery\nprovides 20 points to both agents. In the case of Hanabi, the metric is the total number of\ncards that have been correctly arranged by the players.\n4.1.2\nResults and Analysis\nOvercooked Layouts\nMethod\nCR\nAA\nRing\nFC\nCC\nPPOSP (Schulman et al., 2017) 198.8 ± 4.06\n167.2 ± 3.63\n190.8 ± 4.25\n151.9 ± 3.28\n122.3 ± 3.80\nPBT (Jaderberg et al., 2017)\n216.9 ± 1.31 190.1 ± 8.64\n173.8 ± 18.27 169.5 ± 10.09\n140.1 ± 13.86\nCACGPT-4-turbo\n173.3 ± 6.67\n260.0 ± 11.55 140.0 ± 0.00\n180.0 ± 11.55 160.0 ± 0.00\nCACGPT-3.5-turbo\n33.3 ± 10.88\n46.6 ± 10.88\n40.0 ± 0.00\n66.6 ± 14.40\n53.3 ± 5.44\nCACMixtral8x7B\n46.6 ± 14.40\n200.0 ± 9.42\n113.3 ± 5.44\n46.6 ± 14.40\n100.0 ± 9.42\nTable 1: Performance comparison across Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and\nCAC methods.

This implies that LLM agents outdo\nRL agents that have been trained together through Self-play without any game-specific\ntraining or fine-tuning. It is, however, important to note that LLM agents are significantly\nslower and larger than RL models and are not fit for real-time use yet (latency (seconds) of\n8.36 ± 1.79 with Chain-of-thought and 1.02 ± 0.09 without for GPT-4-turbo). Furthermore,\nother models we tested, GPT-3.5-turbo and Mixtral8x7b, are faster but fall short of the RL\nbaselines. We also see positive results on the CollabCapture and CollabEscape games with\nCAC agents (w. GPT-4), achieving a 100% success rate. However, other LLMs are unable to\ncrack CollabEscape (see Appendix D).\nLLM agents struggle at effective planning when advanced Theory of Mind reasoning is\nrequired. In Hanabi Challenge, LLM agents seem to struggle compared to RL methods (see\nTable 2). Among all LLMs, GPT-4-turbo performs reasonably well, while other LLMs can\n6\nPreprint\nOvercooked Layouts\nMethod\nCR\nAA\nRing\nFC\nCC\nBC (Carroll et al., 2019a)\n103.5 | 110.0\n136.5 | 137.5\n59.0 | 70.0\n20.5 | 31.0\n38.0 | 44.0\nPPOBC (Schulman et al., 2017)\n156.4 | 163.9\n72.6 | 178.8\n126.4 | 129.8\n58.9 | 76.9\n69.5 | 57.6\nCACGPT-4-turbo1\n160.0 | 160.0\n180.0 | 200.0\n160.0 | 140.0\n120.0 | 80.0\n140.0 | 100.0\nTable 4: Zero shot coordination results of AI-Human Proxy Gameplay.

CAC\ncoordinates well with the new, unseen partners.\nbarely complete the Hanabi games. We attribute this failure to two factors. First, there is\nlittle room for errors in Hanabi. Any misplay or mis-clue leads to the loss of a life token.\nSecond, Hanabi requires much more complex Theory of Mind Reasoning compared to the\nOvercoked-AI environment. Each action requires agents to actively consider their partner’s\nbeliefs, intentions, and how they would react to implicit communication.\nIn contrast, Overcooked is fully observable, and its action space consists of actions like pick up\nan onion from onion dispenser 0 and place onion in cooker 0. Under most scenarios and layouts,\nLLMs only need to consider the next best steps based on the state of the environment. For\nexample, We conduct an ablation study of removing partner inventory and location, which\nreveals minimum impact on overall performance (1 less delivery in Cramped Room and\nAsymmetric Advantage layouts each in 100 timesteps), showing that the primary challenge\nfor LLMs in games like Overcooked is the Environment Comprehension ability.\nLLM agents benefit from auxiliary reasoning modules in imperfection information games\nwith low room for errors. Without the support of auxiliary modules, LLM agents seem to\nbomb (lose all three lives) in every game (see Table 3). To rectify this, our CAC framework\nincorporates auxiliary LLM-powered modules, including an Explicit Theory of Mind Rea-\nsoning (ToM) module and an Answer Verification (AV) module. The answer verification\nmodule is a game-changer in its ability to stop LLM hallucinations about environmental\nfacts from causing fatal mistakes, thus reducing the chance of mis-plays. The ToM reasoning\nLLM delegates the responsibility of interpreting partner clues and understanding partner\nneeds to different LLMs, allowing the primary LLM to focus on synthesizing the available\ninformation to plan the next action.\nLLM Agents are robust to unseen partners.\nWe use Overcooked-AI and the Hanabi\nchallenge as testbeds to evaluate the performance of LLM agents when paired with un-\nseen agents. This task is popularly known as Zero Shot Coordination. For experiments in\nOvercooked-AI, we pair our LLM agents as well as baselines with proxy-human agents.\nThese proxy human agents are behavior cloning agents trained using human data by Carroll\net al. (2019b). As shown in Table 4, we discover that LLM agents outperform both Behavior\nCloning as well as PPO agents trained with human data.\nFor experiments in Hanabi, we pair our agents with Off-Belief Learning (OBL) agents (Hu\net al., 2021a). OBL is a MARL strategy that generates grounded clues and actions and is the\n1For CAC, we run a single trial from either position due to cost constraints. In Table 1 we have\nobserved that the performance of CAC agents does not vary by more than one delivery.\n7\nPreprint\nFigure 3: Comparative Performance of LLMs in Three Cognitive Dimensions. The graphs\ndisplay the accuracy of each LLM in EC, ToM Reasoning, and JP, plotted against the model’s\nnumber of parameters (in billions) over three trials.\nstate-of-the-art method for both self-play and cross-play in Hanabi. OBL agents provide\nobservation-grounded clues and collaborate well with humans. Therefore, we use them as\nunseen partners in our experiments. Table 5 shows that CAC agents score an average of\n15.00 points with the OBL-1 agent compared to their self-play scores of 13.66. This indicates\nno degradation in coordination abilities with a new partner. The baseline RL method,\nSimplified Action Decoder (SAD) Hu & Foerster (2021), fails critically when paired with\nunseen OBL agents, even though it excels at self-play (22.00 points) due to self-play training.\nMARL agents trained with self-play struggle when paired with unseen partners in common\npayoff tasks, because they converge to arbitrary policies that only the two partners involved\nin the self-play training understand (Carroll et al., 2019a; Bard et al., 2020). Since LLM agents\nhaven’t been explicitly trained to play these games, they base their outputs on the provided\ntextual observation and commonsense knowledge learned from pre-training, and thus are\nmuch more robust to unseen partners.\n4.2\nCoordination QA\nSetup.\nWe assess the performance of 6 Families of Large Language Models (LLMs) Jiang\net al. (2023; 2024); Touvron et al. (2023); Chiang et al. (2023); OpenAI (2023) across three\ndimensions: Environment Comprehension (EC), Theory of Mind Reasoning (ToM), and\nJoint Planning (JP). For each category, LLMs respond to multiple-choice questions (MCQs),\nwith their responses evaluated against ground-truth answers through fuzzy string matching.\nTo account for the variability in LLM responses, we conduct three trials per model. We also\nreport a Random baseline.\nComparative Results of LLMs in Environment Comprehension, ToM Reasoning, vs. Joint\nPlanning. In Figure 3, we see that most LLMs achieve their best results on the Environment\nComprehension question. The best performing LLM GPT-4-turbo gets more than 80%\nEnvironment Comprehension Questions correct. The overall performance across LLMs\ndrops on the more challenging Theory of Mind reasoning questions, but GPT-4-turbo is\nstill competent, reaching a 54% accuracy. The overall accuracy of LLMs on Joint Planning\nquestions is still significantly weak, with even the best LLM scoring less than 40%, indicating\na large room for improvement in LLMs’ ability to perform coordination reasoning. Another\ncause for concern is that open-source LLMs perform abysmally at Joint Planning, with some\nmodels performing worse than a random baseline.\nVariables\nr\nρ\nToM\n0.813\n0.389\nEC\n0.895\n0.506\nTable 6: Pearson Correlation Coefficient\n(r) and Spearman Rank (ρ) Coefficient re-\nveal moderate to strong positive correla-\ntions of both ToM and EC with JP.\nImpact of Environment Comprehension and\nToM\nReasoning\nabilities\non\nJoint\nPlan-\nning.\nHaving defined Joint Planning as the\ncapacity of an agent to select the appropriate\nsubsequent action based on available informa-\ntion, we argue that proficiency in Environment\nComprehension and Theory of Mind Reasoning\n8\nPreprint\nis crucial for adept Joint Planning, and LLMs\nthat do well at these two will do well at JP. Cor-\nrelation analysis of ToM and EC with JP across\nthe data from Figure 6 reveals that ToM has a\nmoderate positive correlation to JP, whereas EC shows a strong positive correlation.\n5\nRelated Work\nMulti-agent Coordination\nIn Game Theory, Pure Coordination games are situations\nwhere the payoff is commonly shared between all agents. In such situations, cooperating\nis the best strategy. Various benchmarks and games have been used to evaluate Multi-\nAgent Coordination abilities over the years including Multiparticle Environment Lowe\net al. (2017), Overcooked-AI Carroll et al. (2019a), and the Hanabi Challenge Bard et al.\n(2020). The foundational work by Carroll et al. (2019a) emphasized the significance of\nincorporating human data for effective human-ai collaboration. Subsequent research on\nthe Overcooked-AI challenge has pivoted towards enabling self-play-trained agents to\ncoordinate seamlessly with humans within this environment. These studies employ various\ntechniques, including self-play with past agent checkpoints (Strouse et al., 2021), centralized\npopulation entropy objectives (Zhao et al., 2023), open-ended objectives using graph theory\n(Li et al., 2023a), policy ensembles with context-aware mechanisms (Lou et al., 2023), and\nthe incorporation of human biases as linear hidden rewards (Yu et al., 2023), to enhance\nthe training and diversity of AI agents in different scenarios. On the Hanabi Challenge\nmuch effort has been made to learn grounded policies Hu et al. (2021b;a) over arbitrary\nconventions. Embodied environments usually set up in household environments have also\nbeen recently used to study multi-agent coordination (Puig et al., 2021; Jain et al., 2020; 2019;\nGan et al., 2021). The Overwhelming majority of approaches to coordination problems have\nfocused on utilizing and enhancing Reinforcement Learning methods to solve the problems\nof multi-agent coordination. In this work, we argue that Large Language Models are an\nalternative approach to these coordination problems as they show emergent reasoning\nabilities, demonstrate theory-of-mind-like abilities, and do not converge to policies that\ncause arbitrary joint interactions.\nPlanning and Reasoning with Large Language Models\nLarge Language Models (LLMs)\nhave demonstrated remarkable capabilities of reasoning in natural language (OpenAI, 2023;\nOuyang et al., 2022; Chiang et al., 2023), achieving state-of-the-art performance across a\nspectrum of verbal reasoning tasks. It was then shown that LLMs could be augmented\nwith components like memory, tools, perception, and grounding to create agents that could\ninteract with an external environment (the web, simulators, games, etc.) These LLM agents\nhave shown to be capable of solving long-horizon tasks, playing complex games (Wu et al.,\n2023; Wang et al., 2023) and interacting with simulated embodied environments (Liang et al.,\n2022; Song et al., 2022).

(2023b) developed a modular agent framework that was\ncapable of cooperating with partner agents in embodied spatial rearrangement problems,\ndemonstrating increased efficiency through coordination. Zhang et al. (2023a) develop\na specialized architecture that enables LLMs to play in the Overcooked-AI environment.\nLi et al. (2023b) evaluate and show emergent collaborative abilities of LLMs in gamified\nsimulations. In contrast to existing works, our work focuses on evaluating language agents\nin established pure coordination games where coordination is not an optional efficiency\nenhancer but rather a necessity.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this study, we evaluated and analyzed the current large language models in terms of their\nability to reason and act in pure coordination games. We introduced the LLM-Coordination\nbenchmark with its two tasks: 1. Agentic Coordination and 2. CoordinationQA.

Our code is available\nat https:\/\/github.com\/eric-ai-lab\/llm coordination.\n1\nIntroduction\nIn a wide range of activities, from daily tasks such as cooking to critical operations like rescue\nefforts, cooperation without mixed intentions is essential. These scenarios are examples\nof Pure Coordination Games, where all involved parties benefit from choosing strategies\nthat are perfectly aligned, avoiding any conflict of interest. These games require agents\nto reason about their environment and plan while considering the beliefs and intentions\nof their partners. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent\nplanning abilities in both physical and virtual settings (Raman et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023;\nWu et al., 2023), impressive reasoning capabilities (Wei et al., 2022), and the hints of a Theory\nof Mind (Kosinski, 2023) making them promising candidates for developing coordination\nagents. Previous works have explored the use of LLMs for developing collaborative agents,\nyet the requisite conditions, strengths, and limitations of LLMs in coordination games\nremain unclear. In this study, we intend to bridge the gap by performing a comprehensive\nevaluation and analysis of the multi-agent coordination abilities of LLMs.\nTherefore, we introduce a new LLM-Coordination Benchmark featuring two task settings\nfor pure coordination games: 1. Agentic Coordination and 2. CoordinationQA. In Agentic\nCoordination, LLMs are scaffolded with components that allow them to act within actual\ngame environments, providing a holistic evaluation of the competencies of LLMs to act as\ncoordination agents. In CoordinationQA, LLMs have to answer a curated set of questions\nabout edge-case scenarios drawn from coordination games where agents are required\nactively cooperate with their partners. The benchmark includes four collaborative games,\nproviding a comprehensive analysis platform.\nTo enable LLMs for multi-agent coordination, we present a Cognitive Architecture for\nCoordination (CAC) framework that facilitates LLM interaction with game environments in\na plug-and-play approach. CAC translates game elements into textual formats and leverages\nauxiliary LLMs for improved coordination to enable effective multi-agent collaboration.\nOur Experiments on the Agentic Coordination task with CAC reveal that Large Language\nModels are capable of understanding the game objectives, generating coherent reasoning\nfor their next actions, and coordinating with partners across all coordination games. They\nexhibit these competencies without any training, fine-tuning, or few-shot examples.\nA comparative analysis on the Agentic Coordination task reveals that LLM agents outper-\nform Multi-agent RL solutions in games that require minimum theory-of-mind reasoning\nand focus on taking commonsense actions based on the environment. However, they strug-\ngle in more complex settings where agents need to actively consider their partner’s beliefs\nand intentions. We also observe that LLM agents are capable of collaborating with new\npartners, unlike self-play MARL methods (Carroll et al., 2019a; Bard et al., 2020) that fail to\nadapt to unseen agents.\nFor a more nuanced analysis of the coordination abilities of LLMs, we create the Coordi-\nnationQA Suite. This suite is designed to dissect the capabilities of LLMs in single-turn\nreasoning within coordination games, focusing on three key areas: Joint Planning, Theory\nof Mind (ToM), and Environment Comprehension. Joint Planning evaluates LLMs’ decision-\nmaking for optimal long-term outcomes, ToM questions probe the understanding of partner\nagents’ intentions and needs, and Environment Comprehension assesses knowledge of\ngame rules and dynamics. Our findings on CoordinationQA show a marked performance\ngap between GPT-4-turbo and other LLMs across three question types. LLMs are most\nproficient in Environment Comprehension, indicating they understand game rules and\nstates well. However, they face significant challenges in Theory of Mind Reasoning, with\ndifficulty inferring others’ intentions and needs. This issue worsens in Joint Planning,\nwhere most LLMs underperform, some even worse than random choices. These results\nhighlight LLMs’ limited reliability and effectiveness as coordination partners. Additionally,\nour analysis shows a moderate to strong correlation between Theory of Mind Reasoning,\n2\nPreprint\nEnvironment Comprehension, and Joint Planning performance, underscoring their role in\neffective coordination.\nIn summary, our contributions are four-fold:\n1. We introduce the LLM-Coordination Benchmark for evaluating and analyzing LLMs in\nPure Coordination Games, covering multi-turn Agentic Coordination and single-turn\nCoordination QA tasks.\n2. We develop the plug-and-play Cognitive Architecture for Coordination Framework to\nenable LLMs to effectively participate in complex, partially observable coordination\ngames like Hanabi, demonstrating the first zero-shot application for LLM agents in such\nscenarios.\n3. We perform a holistic evaluation of LLM agents in Self-play and Cross-play settings,\noffering a detailed comparison with RL baselines and showcasing their potential as\nCoordination Agents.\n4. We investigate Environment Comprehension and Theory of Mind Reasoning as essen-\ntial components of LLMs’ overall Joint Planning capabilities, highlighting their critical\nimportance in coordination tasks.\n2\nLLM-Coordination Benchmark\n2.1\nMulti-turn Agentic Coordination\nIn the Multi-turn Agentic Coordination task, LLMs participate in end-to-end pure coordi-\nnation games as agents, where the best strategy for all participating agents is to cooperate.\nLLMs under test are plugged into coordination frameworks with components like memory\nmodules and grounding modules to act in complete games. These LLM agents can then be\npartnered with any policies or agents to complete the games.\nOur LLM-Coordination benchmark includes 4 pure coordination games, Hanabi Challenge\n(Bard et al., 2020), Overcooked-AI (Carroll et al., 2019a), Collab Capture and Collab Escape.\nHanabi Challenge: In Hanabi (Bard et al., 2020), players aim to assemble five sequences of\ncards in ascending order (1 through 5). A unique aspect of the game is that the players can\nonly view their partner’s cards, not their own. This requires players to work collaboratively,\nutilizing reveal tokens to provide hints about the cards in their partner’s hand. These hints\ncan be about either the color or the rank of the cards. For instance, using a single hint token,\na player can indicate all cards of a certain rank in their partner’s hand. Hanabi serves as an\nexemplary Pure Coordination game, necessitating player cooperation to achieve optimal\noutcomes. Success in Hanabi hinges on the ability to understand partners’ perspectives,\nnavigate decisions based on incomplete information, and engage in implicit communication,\nmaking it an excellent testing ground for coordination among agents.\nOvercooked-AI: In the Overcooked-AI environment (Carroll et al., 2019a),\ntwo\nagents—Alice (Blue) and Bob (Green)—collaborate to cook and deliver onion soups. This\nenvironment includes a variety of layouts, each with its own arrangement and quantity of\nonion dispensers, plate dispensers, cookers, delivery zones, and countertops. To prepare a\ndish, agents are required to insert three onions into a cooker, initiating a cooking process\nthat lasts 20 time steps. Upon completion, the soup must be plated and delivered to com-\nplete the task. Each layout presents unique challenges, emphasizing the need for agents to\ncomprehend their surroundings, locate necessary resources, and synchronize their actions\nwith their teammate for effective collaboration.\nCollab Capture: Collab Capture involves two agents trying to capture an adversary in a\nmaze of interconnected rooms. The rooms are connected by doors, which can be controlled\nthrough access buttons that can be found in other rooms. The agents’ task is to capture the\nadversary in the least amount of time using effective strategies, including cornering the\nadversary and manipulating the doors to enable their partner or disable the adversary.\n3\nPreprint\nCollab Escape: Collab Escape involves two agents trying to escape an adversary in a maze\nof interconnected rooms. They need to fix two generators (similar to the game Dead-by-\nDaylight (Dea, 2016)) located in different rooms to open an exit portal. The adversary tries\nto catch the agents, and the win condition is any one agent escaping. This game requires\nstrategies like luring the adversary away from the partner, sacrificing for the partner’s safety,\nand manipulating the movement of the adversary.\n2.2\nSingle-turn Coordination QA\nThe agentic coordination task paints a holistic picture of the abilities of LLMs as agents.\nTo dive deeper into the specific strengths and weaknesses of LLMs, we develop the Co-\nordinationQA Suite. Inspired by the idea of Unit Testing for evaluating AI agents Knott\net al. (2021), we manually sampled edge cases from all 4 pure coordination games men-\ntioned in Section 2.1. All of these edge cases necessitate agents to actively understand\ntheir current state, think about their partner’s intentions, and come up with the best plans\nfor coordination. We then create a set of three types of questions for each scenario in our\nCoordinationQA Suite.\n• Environment Comprehension (EC) questions require LLMs to make indirect inferences\nabout some aspect of their environment.\n• Theory of Mind Reasoning (ToM) questions challenge the LLMs to predict the intentions\nof their partners and probe about the requirements of their partners.\n• Joint Planning (JP) questions provide agents with the state\/observation and ask them\nto predict the best next action for effective coordination. This question is essentially the\nsame question that LLMs need to repeatedly solve when they act as agents.\nAll the questions were manually developed and labeled. We filtered out questions and\nscenarios that showed any ambiguity, leaving only questions that had clear optimal solutions.\nWe generated a total of N=66 scenarios (25 from Overcooked, 28 from Hanabi, and 13\nfrom the two Collab Games) and created 3 questions per scenario, resulting in 198 unique\nquestions. The right side of Figure 1 demonstrates the sampling process for the three types\nof questions with an example from the game Overcooked. The selected scenario shows the\nBlue agent about to place their third onion in the cooker, and the green agent needs to figure\nout what to do next.\n3\nCognitive Architecture for Coordination\nWe develop a LLM Agent architecture based on Sumers et al. (2023), which we dub Cognitive\nArchitecture for Coordination (CAC), for multi-agent coordination. Using CAC we can\neasily plug and play a LLM agent, and pair it with any partner (e.g., another CAC agent, a\nhuman player, or other AI agents). The architecture consists of three key elements: Memory,\nReasoning, and Grounding.\nMemory Module includes (1) Long-Term Memory for storing the Game Description includ-\ning the game’s rules, conventions, objectives and action space, (2) Working memory which\nconsists a textual description of the current observation, and (3) Episodic Memory which is\na list of previous actions selected by the agent. In the example shown in Figure 2 the Long\nTerm Memory includes a description of the game of Hanabi, The Working memory includes\nobservations including the current stack, partner’s hand, beliefs and knowledge of both\nagents and information regarding the available tokens, and cards, and the Episodic Memory\nincludes the previously selected discards, plays and hints.\nReasoning Module is where the Large Language Model (LLM) is plugged into the frame-\nwork. It takes the textual description in the working memory as input and generates the next\nbest action based on the context. For coordination games like Hanabi that require a more\nsophisticated Theory of Mind reasoning, we add an auxiliary Theory of Mind Reasoning\nLLM whose sole responsibility is to interpret the partner agent’s actions and requirements.\nThis extra reasoning is added to the working memory before passing to the primary LLM.\nAdditionally, we also utilize a Self-verification LLM which verifies the safety of the selected\n4\nPreprint\nFigure 2: Cognitive Architecture for Coordination (CAC). This framework is segmented\ninto three key components for agentic analysis—Memory, which archives the game descrip-\ntion and current game state; Grounding, which involves the execution of actions selected\nby LLMs; and Reasoning, which encompasses a Theory of Mind (ToM) inference LLM, a\nverifier LLM, and the primary LLM under analysis.\naction. In the Hanabi example in Figure 2, the reasoning module interprets the provided\nclue of ”Revealing Rank 1 Cards” and decides to play one of the pointed cards on the empty\nstacks. The generated action is passed to the grounding module.\nGrounding Module is responsible for interfacing the reasoning and memory modules’\ntextual decision-making spaces with the actual game mechanics. Its primary task is to\ntake the selected action from the reasoning module and translate it into game-compatible\naction(s). The exact implementation of the grounding module depends on the game in\nquestion; for example, in Overcooked-AI, the grounding module needs to convert high-level\nactions like ”pick up onion from o0.” into sequences of lower-level actions. On the other\nhand, in games like Hanabi, it just needs to match actions like ”Reveal Bob’s Red Color\nCards” to their lower-level representations. The grounding module is also responsible for\nthe secondary task of filtering out infeasible actions based on the context of the game.\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nAgentic Coordination\n4.1.1\nSetup\nWe perform two types of experiments in agentic coordination: Self-Play and Cross-Play. In\nself-play settings, the participating agents are of the same type. In Cross-Play experiments,\nwe pair agents with unseen partners, and they need to adapt their behavior to the actions of\nthese new partners.\nSelf-play Baselines: For Overcooked we use Proximal Policy Optimization (Schulman et al.,\n2017) and Population-Based Training (Jaderberg et al., 2017) as baselines for comparison.\nThese baselines were established by Carroll et al. (2019a). The Hanabi challenge has been\nextensively studied and solved using MARL methods. We use Bayesian Action Decoder\n(Bard et al., 2020), Simplified Action Decoder (Hu & Foerster, 2021), and Off-Belief Learning\n(Hu et al., 2021a) as baselines.\n5\nPreprint\nCross-play Baselines: For Overcooked, we use a Behavior Cloning model trained on human\ndata Carroll et al. (2019a) and a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent trained with\nthe Human Behavior Cloning agent Carroll et al. (2019a) as baselines for comparison. We\nalso use human proxies based on behavior cloning as unseen partners. For Hanabi, we use\nthe Simplified Action Decoder (SAD) as a baseline. We pair our agents with the Off-Belief\nLearning (Hu et al., 2021a), which was trained to generate grounded policies and adapt to\nunseen partner agents.\nMetrics: We measure the total score achieved by agents in Overcooked, where each delivery\nprovides 20 points to both agents. In the case of Hanabi, the metric is the total number of\ncards that have been correctly arranged by the players.\n4.1.2\nResults and Analysis\nOvercooked Layouts\nMethod\nCR\nAA\nRing\nFC\nCC\nPPOSP (Schulman et al., 2017) 198.8 ± 4.06\n167.2 ± 3.63\n190.8 ± 4.25\n151.9 ± 3.28\n122.3 ± 3.80\nPBT (Jaderberg et al., 2017)\n216.9 ± 1.31 190.1 ± 8.64\n173.8 ± 18.27 169.5 ± 10.09\n140.1 ± 13.86\nCACGPT-4-turbo\n173.3 ± 6.67\n260.0 ± 11.55 140.0 ± 0.00\n180.0 ± 11.55 160.0 ± 0.00\nCACGPT-3.5-turbo\n33.3 ± 10.88\n46.6 ± 10.88\n40.0 ± 0.00\n66.6 ± 14.40\n53.3 ± 5.44\nCACMixtral8x7B\n46.6 ± 14.40\n200.0 ± 9.42\n113.3 ± 5.44\n46.6 ± 14.40\n100.0 ± 9.42\nTable 1: Performance comparison across Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and\nCAC methods.

GPT-4-turbo) outperform or match the overall performance of RL methods across all\nlayouts of Overcooked-AI. Table 1 presents the numerical scores attained by different agents\nwhen paired with a partner agent of the same type. This implies that LLM agents outdo\nRL agents that have been trained together through Self-play without any game-specific\ntraining or fine-tuning. It is, however, important to note that LLM agents are significantly\nslower and larger than RL models and are not fit for real-time use yet (latency (seconds) of\n8.36 ± 1.79 with Chain-of-thought and 1.02 ± 0.09 without for GPT-4-turbo). Furthermore,\nother models we tested, GPT-3.5-turbo and Mixtral8x7b, are faster but fall short of the RL\nbaselines. We also see positive results on the CollabCapture and CollabEscape games with\nCAC agents (w. GPT-4), achieving a 100% success rate. However, other LLMs are unable to\ncrack CollabEscape (see Appendix D).\nLLM agents struggle at effective planning when advanced Theory of Mind reasoning is\nrequired. In Hanabi Challenge, LLM agents seem to struggle compared to RL methods (see\nTable 2). Among all LLMs, GPT-4-turbo performs reasonably well, while other LLMs can\n6\nPreprint\nOvercooked Layouts\nMethod\nCR\nAA\nRing\nFC\nCC\nBC (Carroll et al., 2019a)\n103.5 | 110.0\n136.5 | 137.5\n59.0 | 70.0\n20.5 | 31.0\n38.0 | 44.0\nPPOBC (Schulman et al., 2017)\n156.4 | 163.9\n72.6 | 178.8\n126.4 | 129.8\n58.9 | 76.9\n69.5 | 57.6\nCACGPT-4-turbo1\n160.0 | 160.0\n180.0 | 200.0\n160.0 | 140.0\n120.0 | 80.0\n140.0 | 100.0\nTable 4: Zero shot coordination results of AI-Human Proxy Gameplay.

CAC\ncoordinates well with the new, unseen partners.\nbarely complete the Hanabi games. We attribute this failure to two factors. First, there is\nlittle room for errors in Hanabi. Any misplay or mis-clue leads to the loss of a life token.\nSecond, Hanabi requires much more complex Theory of Mind Reasoning compared to the\nOvercoked-AI environment. Each action requires agents to actively consider their partner’s\nbeliefs, intentions, and how they would react to implicit communication.\nIn contrast, Overcooked is fully observable, and its action space consists of actions like pick up\nan onion from onion dispenser 0 and place onion in cooker 0. Under most scenarios and layouts,\nLLMs only need to consider the next best steps based on the state of the environment. For\nexample, We conduct an ablation study of removing partner inventory and location, which\nreveals minimum impact on overall performance (1 less delivery in Cramped Room and\nAsymmetric Advantage layouts each in 100 timesteps), showing that the primary challenge\nfor LLMs in games like Overcooked is the Environment Comprehension ability.\nLLM agents benefit from auxiliary reasoning modules in imperfection information games\nwith low room for errors. Without the support of auxiliary modules, LLM agents seem to\nbomb (lose all three lives) in every game (see Table 3). To rectify this, our CAC framework\nincorporates auxiliary LLM-powered modules, including an Explicit Theory of Mind Rea-\nsoning (ToM) module and an Answer Verification (AV) module. The answer verification\nmodule is a game-changer in its ability to stop LLM hallucinations about environmental\nfacts from causing fatal mistakes, thus reducing the chance of mis-plays. The ToM reasoning\nLLM delegates the responsibility of interpreting partner clues and understanding partner\nneeds to different LLMs, allowing the primary LLM to focus on synthesizing the available\ninformation to plan the next action.\nLLM Agents are robust to unseen partners.\nWe use Overcooked-AI and the Hanabi\nchallenge as testbeds to evaluate the performance of LLM agents when paired with un-\nseen agents. This task is popularly known as Zero Shot Coordination. For experiments in\nOvercooked-AI, we pair our LLM agents as well as baselines with proxy-human agents.\nThese proxy human agents are behavior cloning agents trained using human data by Carroll\net al. (2019b). As shown in Table 4, we discover that LLM agents outperform both Behavior\nCloning as well as PPO agents trained with human data.\nFor experiments in Hanabi, we pair our agents with Off-Belief Learning (OBL) agents (Hu\net al., 2021a). OBL is a MARL strategy that generates grounded clues and actions and is the\n1For CAC, we run a single trial from either position due to cost constraints. In Table 1 we have\nobserved that the performance of CAC agents does not vary by more than one delivery.\n7\nPreprint\nFigure 3: Comparative Performance of LLMs in Three Cognitive Dimensions. The graphs\ndisplay the accuracy of each LLM in EC, ToM Reasoning, and JP, plotted against the model’s\nnumber of parameters (in billions) over three trials.\nstate-of-the-art method for both self-play and cross-play in Hanabi. OBL agents provide\nobservation-grounded clues and collaborate well with humans. Therefore, we use them as\nunseen partners in our experiments. Table 5 shows that CAC agents score an average of\n15.00 points with the OBL-1 agent compared to their self-play scores of 13.66. This indicates\nno degradation in coordination abilities with a new partner. The baseline RL method,\nSimplified Action Decoder (SAD) Hu & Foerster (2021), fails critically when paired with\nunseen OBL agents, even though it excels at self-play (22.00 points) due to self-play training.\nMARL agents trained with self-play struggle when paired with unseen partners in common\npayoff tasks, because they converge to arbitrary policies that only the two partners involved\nin the self-play training understand (Carroll et al., 2019a; Bard et al., 2020). Since LLM agents\nhaven’t been explicitly trained to play these games, they base their outputs on the provided\ntextual observation and commonsense knowledge learned from pre-training, and thus are\nmuch more robust to unseen partners.\n4.2\nCoordination QA\nSetup.\nWe assess the performance of 6 Families of Large Language Models (LLMs) Jiang\net al. (2023; 2024); Touvron et al. (2023); Chiang et al. (2023); OpenAI (2023) across three\ndimensions: Environment Comprehension (EC), Theory of Mind Reasoning (ToM), and\nJoint Planning (JP). For each category, LLMs respond to multiple-choice questions (MCQs),\nwith their responses evaluated against ground-truth answers through fuzzy string matching.\nTo account for the variability in LLM responses, we conduct three trials per model. We also\nreport a Random baseline.\nComparative Results of LLMs in Environment Comprehension, ToM Reasoning, vs. Joint\nPlanning. In Figure 3, we see that most LLMs achieve their best results on the Environment\nComprehension question. The best performing LLM GPT-4-turbo gets more than 80%\nEnvironment Comprehension Questions correct. The overall performance across LLMs\ndrops on the more challenging Theory of Mind reasoning questions, but GPT-4-turbo is\nstill competent, reaching a 54% accuracy. The overall accuracy of LLMs on Joint Planning\nquestions is still significantly weak, with even the best LLM scoring less than 40%, indicating\na large room for improvement in LLMs’ ability to perform coordination reasoning. Another\ncause for concern is that open-source LLMs perform abysmally at Joint Planning, with some\nmodels performing worse than a random baseline.\nVariables\nr\nρ\nToM\n0.813\n0.389\nEC\n0.895\n0.506\nTable 6: Pearson Correlation Coefficient\n(r) and Spearman Rank (ρ) Coefficient re-\nveal moderate to strong positive correla-\ntions of both ToM and EC with JP.\nImpact of Environment Comprehension and\nToM\nReasoning\nabilities\non\nJoint\nPlan-\nning.\nHaving defined Joint Planning as the\ncapacity of an agent to select the appropriate\nsubsequent action based on available informa-\ntion, we argue that proficiency in Environment\nComprehension and Theory of Mind Reasoning\n8\nPreprint\nis crucial for adept Joint Planning, and LLMs\nthat do well at these two will do well at JP. Cor-\nrelation analysis of ToM and EC with JP across\nthe data from Figure 6 reveals that ToM has a\nmoderate positive correlation to JP, whereas EC shows a strong positive correlation.\n5\nRelated Work\nMulti-agent Coordination\nIn Game Theory, Pure Coordination games are situations\nwhere the payoff is commonly shared between all agents. In such situations, cooperating\nis the best strategy. Various benchmarks and games have been used to evaluate Multi-\nAgent Coordination abilities over the years including Multiparticle Environment Lowe\net al. (2017), Overcooked-AI Carroll et al. (2019a), and the Hanabi Challenge Bard et al.\n(2020). The foundational work by Carroll et al. (2019a) emphasized the significance of\nincorporating human data for effective human-ai collaboration. Subsequent research on\nthe Overcooked-AI challenge has pivoted towards enabling self-play-trained agents to\ncoordinate seamlessly with humans within this environment. These studies employ various\ntechniques, including self-play with past agent checkpoints (Strouse et al., 2021), centralized\npopulation entropy objectives (Zhao et al., 2023), open-ended objectives using graph theory\n(Li et al., 2023a), policy ensembles with context-aware mechanisms (Lou et al., 2023), and\nthe incorporation of human biases as linear hidden rewards (Yu et al., 2023), to enhance\nthe training and diversity of AI agents in different scenarios. On the Hanabi Challenge\nmuch effort has been made to learn grounded policies Hu et al. (2021b;a) over arbitrary\nconventions. Embodied environments usually set up in household environments have also\nbeen recently used to study multi-agent coordination (Puig et al., 2021; Jain et al., 2020; 2019;\nGan et al., 2021). The Overwhelming majority of approaches to coordination problems have\nfocused on utilizing and enhancing Reinforcement Learning methods to solve the problems\nof multi-agent coordination. In this work, we argue that Large Language Models are an\nalternative approach to these coordination problems as they show emergent reasoning\nabilities, demonstrate theory-of-mind-like abilities, and do not converge to policies that\ncause arbitrary joint interactions.\nPlanning and Reasoning with Large Language Models\nLarge Language Models (LLMs)\nhave demonstrated remarkable capabilities of reasoning in natural language (OpenAI, 2023;\nOuyang et al., 2022; Chiang et al., 2023), achieving state-of-the-art performance across a\nspectrum of verbal reasoning tasks. It was then shown that LLMs could be augmented\nwith components like memory, tools, perception, and grounding to create agents that could\ninteract with an external environment (the web, simulators, games, etc.) These LLM agents\nhave shown to be capable of solving long-horizon tasks, playing complex games (Wu et al.,\n2023; Wang et al., 2023) and interacting with simulated embodied environments (Liang et al.,\n2022; Song et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023b) developed a modular agent framework that was\ncapable of cooperating with partner agents in embodied spatial rearrangement problems,\ndemonstrating increased efficiency through coordination. Zhang et al. (2023a) develop\na specialized architecture that enables LLMs to play in the Overcooked-AI environment.\nLi et al. (2023b) evaluate and show emergent collaborative abilities of LLMs in gamified\nsimulations. In contrast to existing works, our work focuses on evaluating language agents\nin established pure coordination games where coordination is not an optional efficiency\nenhancer but rather a necessity.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this study, we evaluated and analyzed the current large language models in terms of their\nability to reason and act in pure coordination games. We introduced the LLM-Coordination\nbenchmark with its two tasks: 1. Agentic Coordination and 2. CoordinationQA. These\nsettings allowed us to conduct holistic comparative studies of LLMs as agents as well as dive\ndeeper into the fine-grained aspects of LLMs as coordination reasoners. We juxtaposed LLM\nagents with existing Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning agents, discussing the conditions\n9\nPreprint\nin which LLMs thrive and fail. Finally, we discussed the Theory of Mind Reasoning and\nEnvironment Comprehension as prerequisites for coordination and evaluated existing LLMs\non these two components.\n10\nPreprint\n```\n\n#### 5. 学生问题\n问题1：介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」\n问题2：这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？\n问题3：这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？\n\n\n请输出论文总结\n### 输出格式（输出语言用中文）\n```\n## 💡 解答问题1 (...复述学生问题1...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (...复述学生问题2...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (...复述学生问题3...)\n...\n```\n","llm_summary_res":"## 🌟 论文解读 | LLM-Coordination：评估和分析大型语言模型的多智能体协调能力\n\n## 📌 背景痛点\/本文动机\n在许多日常任务和关键操作中，如烹饪和救援行动，合作是至关重要的。这些场景可以被视为纯协调游戏，其中所有参与方都从选择完全一致的战略中受益，避免任何利益冲突。这些游戏要求代理推理他们的环境并计划，同时考虑他们的伙伴的信念和意图。大型语言模型（LLMs）最近在物理和虚拟环境中的涌现规划能力、令人印象深刻的推理能力和对心智理论的暗示，使它们成为开发协调代理的有希望的候选者。然而，LLMs在协调游戏中的必要条件、优势和局限性仍然不清楚。本文旨在通过进行LLMs的多智能体协调能力的全面评估和分析来弥合这一差距。\n\n## 🚀 核心方法\n本文提出了一个新的LLM-Coordination基准，旨在对LLMs在纯协调游戏中的能力进行详细分析。该基准通过两个不同的任务评估LLMs：\n1. **代理协调**：LLMs作为积极合作参与者参与4个纯协调游戏。\n2. **协调问答（QA）**：LLMs被提示回答来自4个游戏的198个多项选择题，以评估三个关键推理能力：环境理解、心智理论推理和联合规划。\n\n此外，为了使LLMs能够进行多智能体协调，本文引入了一个协调认知架构（CAC）框架，该框架可以轻松地将不同的LLMs作为即插即用模块集成到纯协调游戏中。\n\n## 📈 实验结果\n实验结果表明，配备GPT-4-turbo的LLM代理在需要基于环境的常识行动的游戏中，其性能与最先进的强化学习方法相当。此外，零样本协调实验表明，与RL方法不同，LLM代理对新未见伙伴具有鲁棒性。然而，协调QA的结果表明，LLMs的心智理论推理和联合规划能力还有很大的改进空间。分析还揭示了LLMs理解其环境和其伙伴的信念和意图的能力如何影响它们协调计划的能力。\n\n## 💬 可借鉴之处\n本文提出的LLM-Coordination基准和CAC框架为评估和分析LLMs的多智能体协调能力提供了一个有价值的工具。此外，本文的结果突出了LLMs在协调任务中的优势和局限性，并为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。","llm_summary_res_status":200,"order":19,"query_answer":"## 💡 解答问题1 (介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」)\n\n这篇论文提出了一个名为LLM-Coordination的基准，用于评估和分析大型语言模型（LLMs）在纯协调游戏中的多智能体协调能力。该基准包括两个主要任务：\n\n1. **代理协调**：LLMs作为积极合作参与者参与4个纯协调游戏，包括Hanabi Challenge、Overcooked-AI、Collab Capture和Collab Escape。这些游戏要求代理推理他们的环境并计划，同时考虑他们的伙伴的信念和意图。\n\n2. **协调问答（QA）**：LLMs被提示回答来自4个游戏的198个多项选择题，以评估三个关键推理能力：环境理解、心智理论推理和联合规划。\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？)\n\n论文中没有明确说明LLM-Coordination基准所需的特定设备条件，例如GPU数量或内存大小。然而，考虑到LLMs（如GPT-4-turbo）的计算需求，可以推测需要高性能的计算资源。论文中提到，GPT-4-turbo的推理延迟为8.36 ± 1.79秒（使用思维链）和1.02 ± 0.09秒（不使用思维链），这表明LLM推理可能需要强大的GPU和足够的内存来支持。\n\n至于模型训练和推理所使用的设备，论文中没有提供具体信息。然而，考虑到GPT-4-turbo等大型LLMs的训练通常需要大量的计算资源，可以推测训练过程可能使用了多个高性能GPU和大量的内存。\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？)\n\nLLM-Coordination基准的环境设计旨在评估LLMs在纯协调游戏中的协调能力。这些游戏通常具有明确的目标和规则，因此结果奖励通常与游戏的成功完成相关。例如，在Hanabi Challenge中，结果奖励是正确排列的牌的数量，而在Overcooked-AI中，结果奖励是成功交付的洋葱汤的数量。\n\n虽然论文中没有明确提到过程奖励，但可以推测这些游戏可能包含一些过程奖励，例如在游戏过程中获得提示或完成特定任务。这些过程奖励可以帮助LLMs学习有效的协调策略，并避免reward hacking。\n\n总的来说，LLM-Coordination基准的环境设计旨在评估LLMs在纯协调游戏中的协调能力，并支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩。","query_answer_status":200}

These models exhibit remarkable versatility\nby adeptly assuming a wide range of roles—from acting as a Linux terminal to serving as an invest-\nment manager—highlighting their adaptability across various domains. Such ﬂexibility underscores\ntheir potential for broad implementation. Consequently, the development of a benchmark dataset for\nsimulation tasks is imperative in nurturing LLMs’ progression toward becoming true generalists.\nNonetheless, existing benchmarks do not fully evaluate this potential. Current evaluations mainly\nfocus on single-turn, static interactions between users and LLMs [6, 14]. While MT-bench [17]\nattempts to consider multi-turn interactions with 80 examples, its reliance on predeﬁned second\nqueries fails to effectively examine the dynamic responses of different LLMs when engaging with\nusers in complex, long-horizon simulation tasks. In addition, these benchmarks primarily concen-\ntrate on tasks related to general information retrieval and creative writing, with less emphasis on\ncomplex simulation abilities.\nBased on whether the simulation target is a human or not, simulation tasks can be divided into two\ngroups. The former groups correlate to existing role-playing benchmarks focusing on replicating\n∗Corresponding author.\nPreprint. Under review.\nFigure 1: Examples of creative simulation tasks in SIMULBENCH.\nthe language styles and knowledge of famous characters or professions [5, 12, 18, 9] and have been\nwidely investigated. However, the second group of tasks are under consideration. Recent work from\nDuan et al. [3] introducing GTBench to explore LLM’s ability on some language-driven games, is\nbarely beginning to explore this kind of simulation abilities. A comprehensive benchmark covering\nwide-ranging non-human centered tasks for thoroughly assessing the simulation potential of LLMs\nis in urgent need.\nTasks for SIMULBENCH. We have gathered 109 distinct simulation tasks that require LLMs to\nperform in a variety of interfaces. These interfaces include acting as a Linux terminal, an SQL\nexecutor, text-based games such as tic-tac-toe, a generator for passwords with particular constraints,\nan ASCII art creator, a predictor of chemical reactions, and more. Each task speciﬁcation comes\nwith an interface description, some output requirements and an initial user request. Some examples\nof simulation tasks are presented in Figure 1.\nMulti-Turn Script-based Evaluation. MT-bench [17] is designed to test LLMs in a two-turn con-\nversation, where the second turn is predeﬁned. However, our SIMULBENCH necessitates multiple\nturns between users and LLMs. Depending on the task types and context window limit, some tasks\nmay involve conversations exceeding 5 turns, with the majority spanning over 2 turns. To repli-\ncate realistic usage scenarios of LLMs, we employ OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 to simulate a user interacting\ncontinuously with an LLM. To ensure fairness among different test models, we extract challenging\nhistories from the collected dialogues to form the ﬁnal test scripts. Finally, after gathering reactions\nfrom each target LLM, we follow the methodology of previous studies [17, 19, 15], using GPT-4\nto assess and rate the quality of these responses. We also conduct pairwise comparisons for a more\ndetailed analysis.\nExperimental Results and Findings. Our study involved an analysis of 2 proprietary LLMs and\n12 widely used open-source LLMs, speciﬁcally series of models in LLaMA [11], Qwen [1] and\nMixtral [4]. These models are often ranked highly on several existing leaderboards, such as the\nChatbot Arena2. Although the performance of these open-source LLMs is approaching GPT-4-turbo,\nthere is still a conspicuous gap between them. Even the strongest open LLM, LLaMA-3-70B-Chat,\nwas surpassed by GPT-4-turbo on 18.55% more cases on the hard subset of SIMULBENCH.\nWe noticed that recent LLMs can take advantage of history information much better than the pre-\nvious ones, showing superior performance on stateful tasks than the stateless ones. However, we\nalso highlighted the importance of utilizing the context information cautiously and selectively, and\n2https:\/\/huggingface.co\/spaces\/lmsys\/chatbot-arena-leaderboard\n2\nshowed that even the performance of GPT-4o drops from 9.40 to 7.57 on the most challenging scripts\npossibly containing erroneous dialogue history. In addition, we observed that although LLMs are\nknowledgeable and good at question answering, they face obstacles to applying knowledge ﬂexibly\nand tend to exhibit poorer performance in simulation tasks that necessitate more rigorous outputs\n(such as classical encryption algorithms) and strategic plans along with long-horizon memory (such\nas different board games).\n2\nSIMULBENCH\nIn this section, we ﬁrst describe how we collect the tasks for SIMULBENCH, next introduce the\nuser agent for collecting LLM interactions, then explain how we extracted challenging conversation\nhistories and ﬁnally present our evaluation metrics.\n2.1\nOverview\nThe complexity of simulation tasks, characterized by their multi-round nature and the diverse con-\nversation paths inﬂuenced by differing model responses, renders script-based single-turn evalu-\nation [16, 12] and pre-deﬁned multi-turn dialogue templates [17] inappropriate. Previous stud-\nies [18, 13] have employed human volunteers to interact with models and perform evaluations.\nThis approach, however, inherently necessitates that the volunteer possess a thorough understand-\ning of the testing role or be able to readily acquire the needed knowledge through search engines.\nYet, in simulation tasks, some of the required knowledge is highly specialized, such as diverse pro-\ngramming languages in language interpreters or terminal simulators, and algebraic notation in chess\nplayer simulations. Consequently, recruiting knowledgeable volunteers for various scenarios is not\nonly impractical but also challenging to replicate for subsequent research.\nTo address this, we propose a three-stage evaluation framework leveraging the exceptional proﬁ-\nciency of proprietary models in diverse text-based generation tasks. The ﬁrst stage involves the\ncollection of multi-turn dialogues between a ﬁxed user agent and an LLM. Subsequently, challeng-\ning conversation histories will be extracted as testing scripts for fair comparisons. Finally, an LLM\nJudge is utilized to rate the performance of the LLMs’ response in each script. The mean score across\nnumerous testing scripts covering diverse simulation tasks serves as an indicator of the viability of\nusing LLMs as simulators.\n2.2\nCollecting tasks for SIMULBENCH\nIn order to encompass a broad range of simulation scenarios, we utilize tasks found in a publicly\naccessible Github repository named “Awesome ChatGPT Prompts”3. This repository is a platform\nwhere community users share real-world applications of ChatGPT. It contains 168 prompts that\nrepresent a wide array of scenarios.\nWe ﬁltered out role-playing cases manually, modiﬁed the serious mistakes, ﬁlled the placeholders\nin some samples, and collected 59 prompts as the seed data in the end. We treated the prompts as\nsimulation speciﬁcations. Each simulation task speciﬁcation primarily consists of a brief paragraph\ndetailing the task description, output requirements, and an initial user request.\nTo improve the diversity of the testing data, we adopted a 5-shot prompting strategy and prompted\nGPT-4 to generate new simulation tasks. 5 samples are randomly selected from the seed data to\nform the task generation prompt. We carefully checked the quality of generated prompts and only\nreserved the non-repetitive ones. Finally, 109 simulation tasks were collected.\n2.3\nLLM interactions with an user agent\nTo assess the capability of LLMs as simulators, interaction with a user is required. To automate this\ninteraction, we developed a user agent leveraging the capabilities of GPT-3.5-turbo. The model was\ntasked with emulating a real human, generating diverse requests that engage in dialogue with the\nsimulators. To maintain the user agent’s character consistency, we suggested four distinct generic\nresponse strategies, as follows:\n3https:\/\/github.com\/f\/awesome-chatgpt-prompts\n3\n◦Improvement: Identifying errors, ambiguities, or other dis-satisfactions for improvements.\n◦NextStep: Proceeding to the subsequent step or diving deeper into the current topic.\n◦NewRequest: Initiating a new request which is more long-tailed or more difﬁcult.\n◦Others: Other feasible strategies.\nThe ﬁnalized prompt for the user agent is designed to accommodate most kinds of tasks. It can\nalso be modiﬁed slightly by incorporating task-speciﬁc conﬁgurations to improve the user agent’s\nstability. Each time, the dialogue history will be inserted into the placeholder of the prompt, the user\nagent is expected to generate the next utterance together with a brief description of their adopted\nstrategy. The utterance will be extracted as a reply to the current dialogue.\nWe utilized the default prompts for simulators provided by the corresponding LLMs. Throughout the\nconversation, the initial utterance from the user bot is designated as the simulation task speciﬁcation.\nThe simulator and the user bot alternate turns speaking until the maximum turn limit is reached.\n2.4\nTest script extraction\nIntuitively, we can assess the performance of a test model in each dialogue between itself and the\nuser agent across the simulation tasks. Unfortunately, based on our pilot experiments, it suffers from\nunfair comparisons due to the dynamics involved by the user agent. Even though the model’s temper-\nature is set to 0.0 without sampling strategies during decoding, the agent may still raise queries with\nvarious levels of complexity among different test models. This divergence becomes more severe as\nthe conversation goes on. For example, at the 4th turn of simulating a password generator, the user\nagent only queried gpt-4-0124-preview to generate a password with “length=11”, but challenged\nLLaMA-2-70B and Mixtral-8x7B with “length=16” and “length=28” respectively.\nOne possible solution is to collect multiple dialogues for each test model, and use the averaged\nperformance as the ﬁnal result. However, it’s hard to guarantee that the user agent will not be biased\ntoward some models all the time, and it largely aggravates the evaluation cost.\nInstead, we propose to extract challenging dialogue histories as a test script from the user-simulator\ndialogues, and do the script-based evaluation. It imitates the endgames in chess, where the history\ninteractions are provided and the test model is expected to continue the dialogue and generate a\nresponse to the latest user’s query. In this way, our evaluation pipeline assures fair comparisons\namong different models while maintaining the multi-round characteristic of simulation tasks, with\nbetter reproducibility and lower computation costs.\nSpeciﬁcally, we chose gpt-3.5-turbo as the simulator, and collected the dialogue with the user agent\non each simulation task 3 times. Two strategies were adopted to identify challenging test scripts:\n◦We regard the last turn in a dialogue as challenging. The turns before it and the latest user\nquery form a test script.\n◦We adopt GPT-4 to identify whether there is a turn in the given dialogue, where the user’s\nrequest possesses extreme complexity and difﬁculty, resulting in an inaccurate response\nfrom the simulator. If it exists, the turn and turns after it are all recognized as challenging\nand extracted as test scripts.\nFinally, 500 test scripts are selected with the above strategies 4, denoted as SIMULBENCH-All. A\nhard subset containing 275 test scripts collected only by the second strategy is denoted as SIMUL-\nBENCH-Hard. SimulBench is licensed by CC BY NC 4.0 (allowing only non-commercial use).\n2.5\nGPT-4 as judge for scoring & comparing\nEvaluation based on GPT-4 has been widely discussed and adopted in recent works [17, 7, 10], since\nit is more affordable and convenient for re-implementation than hiring human annotators. Consid-\nering the diversity and complexity of simulation tasks, we also adopted GPT-4 as an evaluator to\nassess the performance of a test model in each test script. The evaluation was conducted on a scale\n4We discarded 10 samples where all of the models achieved full scores.\n4\nof 1 to 10. We modiﬁed the evaluation prompt from MT-Bench [17] to suit the task-speciﬁc spec-\niﬁcations and incorporated deﬁnitions for each score. Besides, we also compared the performance\nof two different models in relation to a script of a simulation task. The comparison was categorized\nas a “win”, “lose”, or “tie”. Follow Zheng et al. [17], we swap the order of two responses to avoid\nposition bias and only declare a win when a response is preferred in both orders.\n3\nEvaluation setup\n3.1\nModels\nThe following models with different scales are mainly considered in current work:\nGPT-4-turbo [8] and GPT-4o 5 are proprietary models provided by OpenAI through API requests.\nThe speciﬁc versions we used are gpt-4-0125-turbo and gpt-4o-2024-05-13.\nLLaMA [11] is a collection of publicly released pre-trained and ﬁne-tuned generative text mod-\nels. We experimented with both LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 with different sizes: LLaMA-2-7B-Chat,\nLLaMA-2-13B-Chat, LLaMA-2-70B-Chat, LLaMA-3-8B-Chat, and LLaMA-3-70B-Chat.\nQwen [1] is another series of publicly available foundation models. We chose Qwen1.5-110B-Chat\nand Qwen1.5-7B-Chat for comparison.\nMixtral [4] includes Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 and Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1 which are pre-\ntrained generative Sparse Mixture of Experts. Their latest instruction ﬁne-tuned model, Mistral-7B-\nInstruct-v0.3, is also considered.\n3.2\nImplementation details\nWe set the maximum number of turns as 4 when collecting user-simulator dialogues. All of the\nmodel’s temperatures are equal to 0.0 for better reproduction and fair comparison except the user\nagent’s. It’s equal to 1.2, enabling sampling strategies to achieve diverse user reactions among\nmultiple dialogue sessions given the same simulation task. The maximum token from the user agent\nand the simulation models in each utterance is 300 and 1024 tokens respectively.\n4\nResults\nThis section analyzes the performances of different LLMs.\n4.1\nMain results\nFigure 2 presents the results on all of the tasks in SIMULBENCH by the score (see speciﬁc numbers\nin Table 4).\nGPT-4-turbo achieves the highest score, followed by GPT-4o and LLaMA-3-70B-Chat. It’s abnor-\nmal that GPT-4o lags behind GPT-4-turbo on our SIMULBENCH, contradicting their rankings on\nChatbot Arena Leaderboard 6. More analysis and explanations are in Sec. 4.2.2. Besides, the per-\nformance of open-source models is gradually approaching that of proprietary ones, where LLaMA-\n3-70B-Chat outperforms LLaMA-2-70B-Chat by a margin of 16.35% and 25.06% on all test scripts\nand the hard subset.\nIn the same series of models, the larger ones always perform better than their smaller counterparts.\nHowever, it doesn’t hold among different series. LLaMA-3-70B-Chat is superior to Qwen1.5-110B-\nChat with less than 36% numbers of parameters. Meanwhile, LLaMA-3-8B-Chat shows favorable\nperformance than both the mixture-of-experts version and the instruction fune-tuned model from the\nMixtral family, and its pioneers based on LLaMA-2.\nComparing the performance between SIMULBENCH-All and SIMULBENCH-Hard, we can see the\ntrend that the stronger the model, the less its score declines.\nHowever, there an only outliers:\nQwen1.5-7B-Chat.

To eliminate the inﬂuence of different\nscript types deﬁned in Sec. 4.2.2, we focus on the scripts in FirstChan, containing 38 stateless and\n55 stateful scripts.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 3(a). There is a clear difference in the ﬁgure where top-5 LLMs perform\nbetter on stateful tasks while the weaker LLMs prefer stateless tasks regardless of LLaMA-2-7B-\nChat. Comparing LLaMA-3-8B-Chat with other LLMs with less than 10B parameters, it achieves\nsuperior gains on stateful tasks, increased by 19.38%, 24.03% and 36.92% over Qwen, Mistral and\n6\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nGPT-4-turbo\nLLaMA-3-70B-Chat\nGPT-4o\nQwen1.5-110B-Chat\nLLaMA-3-8B-Chat\nMixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1\nQwen1.5-7B-Chat\nMixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1\nLLaMA-2-70B-Chat\nMistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3\nStateless\nStateful\n(a) Stateless vs Stateful\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nGPT-4-turbo\nLLaMA-3-70B-Chat\nGPT-4o\nQwen1.5-110B-Chat\nLLaMA-3-8B-Chat\nMixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1\nQwen1.5-7B-Chat\nMixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1\nLLaMA-2-70B-Chat\nMistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3\nLastOnly\nFirstChan\nSubseqChan\n(b) LastOnly vs FirstChan vs SubseqChan\nFigure 3: Performances of LLMs on SIMULBENCH in different categories.\nLLaMA-2 respectively. Qwen1.5 with parameters increased from 7B to 110B also transforms from\na better stateless simulator to a better stateful simulator. Overall, strong LLMs have better abilities\nin utilizing history information, and show more stable performances on different simulation tasks.\nBesides, the poor performances of Qwen1.5-7B-Chat on both kinds of tasks explains why it performs\npoorly on SIMULBENCH-Hard, suffering more on stateful simulation tasks.\n4.2.2\nPerformances on different kinds of scripts\nBased on the script extraction strategy introduced in Sec. 2.4, we classify all the scripts into three\ncategories:\n◦LastOnly refers to 225 scripts extracted by the ﬁrst strategy and not considered by the\nsecond strategy.\n◦FirstChan has 93 scripts from the second strategy while only considering the ﬁrst recog-\nnized challenging turn.\n◦SubseqChan contains 182 scripts with subsequent challenging turns after the ﬁrst one.\nFirstChan and SubseqChan constitute SIMULBENCH-Hard.\nAccording to results in Fig. 3(b), LastOnly is much easier than the other two types. All of the\nLLMs achieve scores above 8, with top-5 of them more than 9. LLaMA-3-70B-Chat even slightly\noutperforms GPT-4-Turbo among this group of easier test samples.\nSubseqChan is generally more challenging than FirstChain. It should be noted that scripts in Sub-\nseqChan may contain content or format errors in their dialogue history. Simulators are supposed to\navoid the impact of previous error information and always provide a high-quality answer to the latest\nuser query. Most of the LLMs perform more poorly in this category, where GPT-4o and Qwen1.5-\n110B-Chat drop dramatically by around 1 point. It reﬂects that both of them are truly aware of\nthe history messages, but have not learned to take the essence and discard the dross so far. Even\nthough some smaller models do perform better on SubseqChan, it doesn’t mean that they have better\nhistory modeling ability considering their overall poor scores. How to selectively utilize historical\ninformation should be paying more attention in the further model design.\nGPT-4o outperforms GPT-4-Turbo on both LastOnly and FirstChan, but performs much weaker on\nSubseqChan. This also explains why it lags behind GPT-4-Turbo on SIMULBENCH-Hard.\n7\n4.2.3\nWhich speciﬁc simulation tasks are harder?\nWe also wondering if there are any common characteristics among the speciﬁc simulation tasks that\nLLMs are good at or poor at. The average score of all LLMs considered above is averaged for each\nsimulation task to present its complexity. We list the 10 simplest tasks and the 10 hardest ones that\nbelong to different simulation types in Table 2.\nTable 2: The simpliest and hardest simulation tasks.\nTasks\nStateless Tasks\nStateful Tasks\nSimplest\nEducational Content Creator, Prompt\nEnhancer, Virtual Veterinarian, Artiﬁ-\ncial Sommelier, Urban Myth Debunker,\nStartup\nIdea\nGenerator,\nWikipedia\npage, Fancy Title Generator, Historical\nError Corrector, Etiquette Expert\nDungeon Master, Text Based Adven-\nture Game, Project Manager Simulator,\nJSON Data Store, SQL terminal, Vir-\ntual Detective, Space Station Simula-\ntion, Mars Colony Simulator, Virtual\nSpace Mission Commander, Car Navi-\ngation System\nHardest\nSVG designer, Cryptographer, Plagia-\nrism Checker, Smart Domain Name\nGenerator,\nCryptographic\nSystem,\nAscii Artist, Chemical Equation Bal-\nancer, English Pronunciation Helper,\nPrompt Generator, Diagram Generator,\nNew Language Creator\nChess Game Simulator, Redux State\nManager,\nExcel Sheet,\nCity\nPlan-\nner, Tic-Tac-Toe Game, Mars Rover\nSimulator,\nChess\nPlayer,\nJapanese\nKanji quiz machine, Python Interpreter,\nGomoku player\nOverall, LLMs perform well on subjective tasks where the output is more free-formed, such as\nStartup Idea Generator and Text Based Adventure Game. However, it exhibits weaker performance\non objective tasks which have underlying rules and output requirements.\nFor stateless tasks, most of the hardest simulations present character-level constraints and require\nan accurate response. Cryptographic system is a representative task that asks the model to encrypt\na plain text message with a cryptographic method. LLMs, especially the open source ones, mostly\nfailed on this task when asked to encrypt \"Hello World\" using a Caesar cipher with rotation 5. SVG\ndesigner, requiring the simulator to create images with SVG codes and convert the codes to a base64\ndata URL, is more complicated. Stronger LLMs encode wrong attributes of the image, while outputs\nof weaker LLMs may even get out of control.\nFor stateful tasks, the simulation of board games is extremely difﬁcult. It not only requires character-\nlevel updates as the dialogue progresses, but also expects to follow complicated rules and even\nmanage winning tactics. All of the models are clear about game rules when asked but failed to\nmaintain an orderly and challenging gaming environment, and even start a wrong game board as\nshown in Fig. 1, indicating that knowledgeable LLMs are not good at applying knowledge. Tasks\nrelated to codes, such as different programming language interpreters and Linux Terminal, perform\nslightly better in board games. The major reason is that codes have been widely considered as an\nimportant part of the training data while more strategic chess journals are not specially considered.\n4.3\nHuman evaluation\nTo ensure the quality of GPT-4 Judge’s outputs for scoring, we randomly sampled 100 outputs and\nasked a human annotator to verify if the output was reasonable. The annotator was required to try\ntheir best to understand the complicated simulation tasks with the help of searching on the Internet.\n83% of samples are considered reasonable for both their short explanations and scores in the outputs,\nshowing the reliability of GPT-4 as a judge for simulation tasks. Most scores in the rest samples are\nhigher than the annotator’s expectation, showing that the judge may be too optimistic in some cases.\n8\n4.4\nEthical concerns\nWe use the Perspective API 7 to assess the potential toxicity in our data. The simulation task speciﬁ-\ncation and all of the dialogue scripts are scored for toxicity across six attributes. The score for each\nattribute ranges from 0 to 1, which is the lower the safer. The averaged scores of all samples are\nsummarized in Table 3. None of the scores is higher than 0.07, exhibiting little toxicity.\nTable 3: Perspective API results of toxicity assessment.\nAttributes\ntoxicity\nsevere toxicity\nidentity attack\ninsult\nprofanity\nthreat\nSimulation Task\n0.06\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.01\nTesting Script\n0.07\n0.00\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.02\n5\nConclusion\nWe present a hard benchmark, SIMULBENCH, speciﬁcally aimed to evaluate LLMs’ performance\nacross different simulation tasks.

While\nthese simulation tasks serve as effective measures of an LLM's general\nintelligence, they are seldom incorporated into existing benchmarks.

These models exhibit remarkable versatility\nby adeptly assuming a wide range of roles—from acting as a Linux terminal to serving as an invest-\nment manager—highlighting their adaptability across various domains. Such ﬂexibility underscores\ntheir potential for broad implementation. Consequently, the development of a benchmark dataset for\nsimulation tasks is imperative in nurturing LLMs’ progression toward becoming true generalists.\nNonetheless, existing benchmarks do not fully evaluate this potential. Current evaluations mainly\nfocus on single-turn, static interactions between users and LLMs [6, 14]. While MT-bench [17]\nattempts to consider multi-turn interactions with 80 examples, its reliance on predeﬁned second\nqueries fails to effectively examine the dynamic responses of different LLMs when engaging with\nusers in complex, long-horizon simulation tasks. In addition, these benchmarks primarily concen-\ntrate on tasks related to general information retrieval and creative writing, with less emphasis on\ncomplex simulation abilities.\nBased on whether the simulation target is a human or not, simulation tasks can be divided into two\ngroups. The former groups correlate to existing role-playing benchmarks focusing on replicating\n∗Corresponding author.\nPreprint. Under review.\nFigure 1: Examples of creative simulation tasks in SIMULBENCH.\nthe language styles and knowledge of famous characters or professions [5, 12, 18, 9] and have been\nwidely investigated. However, the second group of tasks are under consideration. Recent work from\nDuan et al. [3] introducing GTBench to explore LLM’s ability on some language-driven games, is\nbarely beginning to explore this kind of simulation abilities. A comprehensive benchmark covering\nwide-ranging non-human centered tasks for thoroughly assessing the simulation potential of LLMs\nis in urgent need.\nTasks for SIMULBENCH. We have gathered 109 distinct simulation tasks that require LLMs to\nperform in a variety of interfaces. These interfaces include acting as a Linux terminal, an SQL\nexecutor, text-based games such as tic-tac-toe, a generator for passwords with particular constraints,\nan ASCII art creator, a predictor of chemical reactions, and more. Each task speciﬁcation comes\nwith an interface description, some output requirements and an initial user request. Some examples\nof simulation tasks are presented in Figure 1.\nMulti-Turn Script-based Evaluation. MT-bench [17] is designed to test LLMs in a two-turn con-\nversation, where the second turn is predeﬁned. However, our SIMULBENCH necessitates multiple\nturns between users and LLMs. Depending on the task types and context window limit, some tasks\nmay involve conversations exceeding 5 turns, with the majority spanning over 2 turns. To repli-\ncate realistic usage scenarios of LLMs, we employ OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 to simulate a user interacting\ncontinuously with an LLM. To ensure fairness among different test models, we extract challenging\nhistories from the collected dialogues to form the ﬁnal test scripts. Finally, after gathering reactions\nfrom each target LLM, we follow the methodology of previous studies [17, 19, 15], using GPT-4\nto assess and rate the quality of these responses. We also conduct pairwise comparisons for a more\ndetailed analysis.\nExperimental Results and Findings. Our study involved an analysis of 2 proprietary LLMs and\n12 widely used open-source LLMs, speciﬁcally series of models in LLaMA [11], Qwen [1] and\nMixtral [4]. These models are often ranked highly on several existing leaderboards, such as the\nChatbot Arena2. Although the performance of these open-source LLMs is approaching GPT-4-turbo,\nthere is still a conspicuous gap between them. Even the strongest open LLM, LLaMA-3-70B-Chat,\nwas surpassed by GPT-4-turbo on 18.55% more cases on the hard subset of SIMULBENCH.\nWe noticed that recent LLMs can take advantage of history information much better than the pre-\nvious ones, showing superior performance on stateful tasks than the stateless ones. However, we\nalso highlighted the importance of utilizing the context information cautiously and selectively, and\n2https:\/\/huggingface.co\/spaces\/lmsys\/chatbot-arena-leaderboard\n2\nshowed that even the performance of GPT-4o drops from 9.40 to 7.57 on the most challenging scripts\npossibly containing erroneous dialogue history. In addition, we observed that although LLMs are\nknowledgeable and good at question answering, they face obstacles to applying knowledge ﬂexibly\nand tend to exhibit poorer performance in simulation tasks that necessitate more rigorous outputs\n(such as classical encryption algorithms) and strategic plans along with long-horizon memory (such\nas different board games).\n2\nSIMULBENCH\nIn this section, we ﬁrst describe how we collect the tasks for SIMULBENCH, next introduce the\nuser agent for collecting LLM interactions, then explain how we extracted challenging conversation\nhistories and ﬁnally present our evaluation metrics.\n2.1\nOverview\nThe complexity of simulation tasks, characterized by their multi-round nature and the diverse con-\nversation paths inﬂuenced by differing model responses, renders script-based single-turn evalu-\nation [16, 12] and pre-deﬁned multi-turn dialogue templates [17] inappropriate. Previous stud-\nies [18, 13] have employed human volunteers to interact with models and perform evaluations.\nThis approach, however, inherently necessitates that the volunteer possess a thorough understand-\ning of the testing role or be able to readily acquire the needed knowledge through search engines.\nYet, in simulation tasks, some of the required knowledge is highly specialized, such as diverse pro-\ngramming languages in language interpreters or terminal simulators, and algebraic notation in chess\nplayer simulations. Consequently, recruiting knowledgeable volunteers for various scenarios is not\nonly impractical but also challenging to replicate for subsequent research.\nTo address this, we propose a three-stage evaluation framework leveraging the exceptional proﬁ-\nciency of proprietary models in diverse text-based generation tasks. The ﬁrst stage involves the\ncollection of multi-turn dialogues between a ﬁxed user agent and an LLM. Subsequently, challeng-\ning conversation histories will be extracted as testing scripts for fair comparisons. Finally, an LLM\nJudge is utilized to rate the performance of the LLMs’ response in each script. The mean score across\nnumerous testing scripts covering diverse simulation tasks serves as an indicator of the viability of\nusing LLMs as simulators.\n2.2\nCollecting tasks for SIMULBENCH\nIn order to encompass a broad range of simulation scenarios, we utilize tasks found in a publicly\naccessible Github repository named “Awesome ChatGPT Prompts”3. This repository is a platform\nwhere community users share real-world applications of ChatGPT. It contains 168 prompts that\nrepresent a wide array of scenarios.\nWe ﬁltered out role-playing cases manually, modiﬁed the serious mistakes, ﬁlled the placeholders\nin some samples, and collected 59 prompts as the seed data in the end. We treated the prompts as\nsimulation speciﬁcations. Each simulation task speciﬁcation primarily consists of a brief paragraph\ndetailing the task description, output requirements, and an initial user request.\nTo improve the diversity of the testing data, we adopted a 5-shot prompting strategy and prompted\nGPT-4 to generate new simulation tasks. 5 samples are randomly selected from the seed data to\nform the task generation prompt. We carefully checked the quality of generated prompts and only\nreserved the non-repetitive ones. Finally, 109 simulation tasks were collected.\n2.3\nLLM interactions with an user agent\nTo assess the capability of LLMs as simulators, interaction with a user is required. To automate this\ninteraction, we developed a user agent leveraging the capabilities of GPT-3.5-turbo. The model was\ntasked with emulating a real human, generating diverse requests that engage in dialogue with the\nsimulators. To maintain the user agent’s character consistency, we suggested four distinct generic\nresponse strategies, as follows:\n3https:\/\/github.com\/f\/awesome-chatgpt-prompts\n3\n◦Improvement: Identifying errors, ambiguities, or other dis-satisfactions for improvements.\n◦NextStep: Proceeding to the subsequent step or diving deeper into the current topic.\n◦NewRequest: Initiating a new request which is more long-tailed or more difﬁcult.\n◦Others: Other feasible strategies.\nThe ﬁnalized prompt for the user agent is designed to accommodate most kinds of tasks. It can\nalso be modiﬁed slightly by incorporating task-speciﬁc conﬁgurations to improve the user agent’s\nstability. Each time, the dialogue history will be inserted into the placeholder of the prompt, the user\nagent is expected to generate the next utterance together with a brief description of their adopted\nstrategy. The utterance will be extracted as a reply to the current dialogue.\nWe utilized the default prompts for simulators provided by the corresponding LLMs. Throughout the\nconversation, the initial utterance from the user bot is designated as the simulation task speciﬁcation.\nThe simulator and the user bot alternate turns speaking until the maximum turn limit is reached.\n2.4\nTest script extraction\nIntuitively, we can assess the performance of a test model in each dialogue between itself and the\nuser agent across the simulation tasks. Unfortunately, based on our pilot experiments, it suffers from\nunfair comparisons due to the dynamics involved by the user agent. Even though the model’s temper-\nature is set to 0.0 without sampling strategies during decoding, the agent may still raise queries with\nvarious levels of complexity among different test models. This divergence becomes more severe as\nthe conversation goes on. For example, at the 4th turn of simulating a password generator, the user\nagent only queried gpt-4-0124-preview to generate a password with “length=11”, but challenged\nLLaMA-2-70B and Mixtral-8x7B with “length=16” and “length=28” respectively.\nOne possible solution is to collect multiple dialogues for each test model, and use the averaged\nperformance as the ﬁnal result. However, it’s hard to guarantee that the user agent will not be biased\ntoward some models all the time, and it largely aggravates the evaluation cost.\nInstead, we propose to extract challenging dialogue histories as a test script from the user-simulator\ndialogues, and do the script-based evaluation. It imitates the endgames in chess, where the history\ninteractions are provided and the test model is expected to continue the dialogue and generate a\nresponse to the latest user’s query. In this way, our evaluation pipeline assures fair comparisons\namong different models while maintaining the multi-round characteristic of simulation tasks, with\nbetter reproducibility and lower computation costs.\nSpeciﬁcally, we chose gpt-3.5-turbo as the simulator, and collected the dialogue with the user agent\non each simulation task 3 times. Two strategies were adopted to identify challenging test scripts:\n◦We regard the last turn in a dialogue as challenging. The turns before it and the latest user\nquery form a test script.\n◦We adopt GPT-4 to identify whether there is a turn in the given dialogue, where the user’s\nrequest possesses extreme complexity and difﬁculty, resulting in an inaccurate response\nfrom the simulator. If it exists, the turn and turns after it are all recognized as challenging\nand extracted as test scripts.\nFinally, 500 test scripts are selected with the above strategies 4, denoted as SIMULBENCH-All. A\nhard subset containing 275 test scripts collected only by the second strategy is denoted as SIMUL-\nBENCH-Hard. SimulBench is licensed by CC BY NC 4.0 (allowing only non-commercial use).\n2.5\nGPT-4 as judge for scoring & comparing\nEvaluation based on GPT-4 has been widely discussed and adopted in recent works [17, 7, 10], since\nit is more affordable and convenient for re-implementation than hiring human annotators. Consid-\nering the diversity and complexity of simulation tasks, we also adopted GPT-4 as an evaluator to\nassess the performance of a test model in each test script. The evaluation was conducted on a scale\n4We discarded 10 samples where all of the models achieved full scores.\n4\nof 1 to 10. We modiﬁed the evaluation prompt from MT-Bench [17] to suit the task-speciﬁc spec-\niﬁcations and incorporated deﬁnitions for each score. Besides, we also compared the performance\nof two different models in relation to a script of a simulation task. The comparison was categorized\nas a “win”, “lose”, or “tie”. Follow Zheng et al. [17], we swap the order of two responses to avoid\nposition bias and only declare a win when a response is preferred in both orders.\n3\nEvaluation setup\n3.1\nModels\nThe following models with different scales are mainly considered in current work:\nGPT-4-turbo [8] and GPT-4o 5 are proprietary models provided by OpenAI through API requests.\nThe speciﬁc versions we used are gpt-4-0125-turbo and gpt-4o-2024-05-13.\nLLaMA [11] is a collection of publicly released pre-trained and ﬁne-tuned generative text mod-\nels. We experimented with both LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 with different sizes: LLaMA-2-7B-Chat,\nLLaMA-2-13B-Chat, LLaMA-2-70B-Chat, LLaMA-3-8B-Chat, and LLaMA-3-70B-Chat.\nQwen [1] is another series of publicly available foundation models. We chose Qwen1.5-110B-Chat\nand Qwen1.5-7B-Chat for comparison.\nMixtral [4] includes Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 and Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1 which are pre-\ntrained generative Sparse Mixture of Experts. Their latest instruction ﬁne-tuned model, Mistral-7B-\nInstruct-v0.3, is also considered.\n3.2\nImplementation details\nWe set the maximum number of turns as 4 when collecting user-simulator dialogues. All of the\nmodel’s temperatures are equal to 0.0 for better reproduction and fair comparison except the user\nagent’s. It’s equal to 1.2, enabling sampling strategies to achieve diverse user reactions among\nmultiple dialogue sessions given the same simulation task. The maximum token from the user agent\nand the simulation models in each utterance is 300 and 1024 tokens respectively.\n4\nResults\nThis section analyzes the performances of different LLMs.\n4.1\nMain results\nFigure 2 presents the results on all of the tasks in SIMULBENCH by the score (see speciﬁc numbers\nin Table 4).\nGPT-4-turbo achieves the highest score, followed by GPT-4o and LLaMA-3-70B-Chat. It’s abnor-\nmal that GPT-4o lags behind GPT-4-turbo on our SIMULBENCH, contradicting their rankings on\nChatbot Arena Leaderboard 6. More analysis and explanations are in Sec. 4.2.2. Besides, the per-\nformance of open-source models is gradually approaching that of proprietary ones, where LLaMA-\n3-70B-Chat outperforms LLaMA-2-70B-Chat by a margin of 16.35% and 25.06% on all test scripts\nand the hard subset.\nIn the same series of models, the larger ones always perform better than their smaller counterparts.\nHowever, it doesn’t hold among different series. LLaMA-3-70B-Chat is superior to Qwen1.5-110B-\nChat with less than 36% numbers of parameters. Meanwhile, LLaMA-3-8B-Chat shows favorable\nperformance than both the mixture-of-experts version and the instruction fune-tuned model from the\nMixtral family, and its pioneers based on LLaMA-2.\nComparing the performance between SIMULBENCH-All and SIMULBENCH-Hard, we can see the\ntrend that the stronger the model, the less its score declines.\nHowever, there an only outliers:\nQwen1.5-7B-Chat.

To eliminate the inﬂuence of different\nscript types deﬁned in Sec. 4.2.2, we focus on the scripts in FirstChan, containing 38 stateless and\n55 stateful scripts.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 3(a). There is a clear difference in the ﬁgure where top-5 LLMs perform\nbetter on stateful tasks while the weaker LLMs prefer stateless tasks regardless of LLaMA-2-7B-\nChat. Comparing LLaMA-3-8B-Chat with other LLMs with less than 10B parameters, it achieves\nsuperior gains on stateful tasks, increased by 19.38%, 24.03% and 36.92% over Qwen, Mistral and\n6\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nGPT-4-turbo\nLLaMA-3-70B-Chat\nGPT-4o\nQwen1.5-110B-Chat\nLLaMA-3-8B-Chat\nMixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1\nQwen1.5-7B-Chat\nMixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1\nLLaMA-2-70B-Chat\nMistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3\nStateless\nStateful\n(a) Stateless vs Stateful\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nGPT-4-turbo\nLLaMA-3-70B-Chat\nGPT-4o\nQwen1.5-110B-Chat\nLLaMA-3-8B-Chat\nMixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1\nQwen1.5-7B-Chat\nMixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1\nLLaMA-2-70B-Chat\nMistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3\nLastOnly\nFirstChan\nSubseqChan\n(b) LastOnly vs FirstChan vs SubseqChan\nFigure 3: Performances of LLMs on SIMULBENCH in different categories.\nLLaMA-2 respectively. Qwen1.5 with parameters increased from 7B to 110B also transforms from\na better stateless simulator to a better stateful simulator. Overall, strong LLMs have better abilities\nin utilizing history information, and show more stable performances on different simulation tasks.\nBesides, the poor performances of Qwen1.5-7B-Chat on both kinds of tasks explains why it performs\npoorly on SIMULBENCH-Hard, suffering more on stateful simulation tasks.\n4.2.2\nPerformances on different kinds of scripts\nBased on the script extraction strategy introduced in Sec. 2.4, we classify all the scripts into three\ncategories:\n◦LastOnly refers to 225 scripts extracted by the ﬁrst strategy and not considered by the\nsecond strategy.\n◦FirstChan has 93 scripts from the second strategy while only considering the ﬁrst recog-\nnized challenging turn.\n◦SubseqChan contains 182 scripts with subsequent challenging turns after the ﬁrst one.\nFirstChan and SubseqChan constitute SIMULBENCH-Hard.\nAccording to results in Fig. 3(b), LastOnly is much easier than the other two types. All of the\nLLMs achieve scores above 8, with top-5 of them more than 9. LLaMA-3-70B-Chat even slightly\noutperforms GPT-4-Turbo among this group of easier test samples.\nSubseqChan is generally more challenging than FirstChain. It should be noted that scripts in Sub-\nseqChan may contain content or format errors in their dialogue history. Simulators are supposed to\navoid the impact of previous error information and always provide a high-quality answer to the latest\nuser query. Most of the LLMs perform more poorly in this category, where GPT-4o and Qwen1.5-\n110B-Chat drop dramatically by around 1 point. It reﬂects that both of them are truly aware of\nthe history messages, but have not learned to take the essence and discard the dross so far. Even\nthough some smaller models do perform better on SubseqChan, it doesn’t mean that they have better\nhistory modeling ability considering their overall poor scores. How to selectively utilize historical\ninformation should be paying more attention in the further model design.\nGPT-4o outperforms GPT-4-Turbo on both LastOnly and FirstChan, but performs much weaker on\nSubseqChan. This also explains why it lags behind GPT-4-Turbo on SIMULBENCH-Hard.\n7\n4.2.3\nWhich speciﬁc simulation tasks are harder?\nWe also wondering if there are any common characteristics among the speciﬁc simulation tasks that\nLLMs are good at or poor at. The average score of all LLMs considered above is averaged for each\nsimulation task to present its complexity. We list the 10 simplest tasks and the 10 hardest ones that\nbelong to different simulation types in Table 2.\nTable 2: The simpliest and hardest simulation tasks.\nTasks\nStateless Tasks\nStateful Tasks\nSimplest\nEducational Content Creator, Prompt\nEnhancer, Virtual Veterinarian, Artiﬁ-\ncial Sommelier, Urban Myth Debunker,\nStartup\nIdea\nGenerator,\nWikipedia\npage, Fancy Title Generator, Historical\nError Corrector, Etiquette Expert\nDungeon Master, Text Based Adven-\nture Game, Project Manager Simulator,\nJSON Data Store, SQL terminal, Vir-\ntual Detective, Space Station Simula-\ntion, Mars Colony Simulator, Virtual\nSpace Mission Commander, Car Navi-\ngation System\nHardest\nSVG designer, Cryptographer, Plagia-\nrism Checker, Smart Domain Name\nGenerator,\nCryptographic\nSystem,\nAscii Artist, Chemical Equation Bal-\nancer, English Pronunciation Helper,\nPrompt Generator, Diagram Generator,\nNew Language Creator\nChess Game Simulator, Redux State\nManager,\nExcel Sheet,\nCity\nPlan-\nner, Tic-Tac-Toe Game, Mars Rover\nSimulator,\nChess\nPlayer,\nJapanese\nKanji quiz machine, Python Interpreter,\nGomoku player\nOverall, LLMs perform well on subjective tasks where the output is more free-formed, such as\nStartup Idea Generator and Text Based Adventure Game. However, it exhibits weaker performance\non objective tasks which have underlying rules and output requirements.\nFor stateless tasks, most of the hardest simulations present character-level constraints and require\nan accurate response. Cryptographic system is a representative task that asks the model to encrypt\na plain text message with a cryptographic method. LLMs, especially the open source ones, mostly\nfailed on this task when asked to encrypt \"Hello World\" using a Caesar cipher with rotation 5. SVG\ndesigner, requiring the simulator to create images with SVG codes and convert the codes to a base64\ndata URL, is more complicated. Stronger LLMs encode wrong attributes of the image, while outputs\nof weaker LLMs may even get out of control.\nFor stateful tasks, the simulation of board games is extremely difﬁcult. It not only requires character-\nlevel updates as the dialogue progresses, but also expects to follow complicated rules and even\nmanage winning tactics. All of the models are clear about game rules when asked but failed to\nmaintain an orderly and challenging gaming environment, and even start a wrong game board as\nshown in Fig. 1, indicating that knowledgeable LLMs are not good at applying knowledge. Tasks\nrelated to codes, such as different programming language interpreters and Linux Terminal, perform\nslightly better in board games. The major reason is that codes have been widely considered as an\nimportant part of the training data while more strategic chess journals are not specially considered.\n4.3\nHuman evaluation\nTo ensure the quality of GPT-4 Judge’s outputs for scoring, we randomly sampled 100 outputs and\nasked a human annotator to verify if the output was reasonable. The annotator was required to try\ntheir best to understand the complicated simulation tasks with the help of searching on the Internet.\n83% of samples are considered reasonable for both their short explanations and scores in the outputs,\nshowing the reliability of GPT-4 as a judge for simulation tasks. Most scores in the rest samples are\nhigher than the annotator’s expectation, showing that the judge may be too optimistic in some cases.\n8\n4.4\nEthical concerns\nWe use the Perspective API 7 to assess the potential toxicity in our data. The simulation task speciﬁ-\ncation and all of the dialogue scripts are scored for toxicity across six attributes. The score for each\nattribute ranges from 0 to 1, which is the lower the safer.

By categorizing tasks from different aspects, we high-\nlight that the model should cautiously attend to their historical context. We also observe that LLMs\nperform sub-optimally in objective simulation tasks, especially those that require an accurate re-\nsponse with complex character-level constraints and scenarios requiring a stateful strategy system\nto be built within LLMs’ simulations, pointing to important future research.\nThe simulation scenarios in the current benchmark are still limited by 109 simulation tasks and a\nsingle user agent.

However,\nvideo games do not only serve as benchmarks but also represent a vast entertainment industry where\nAI agents may eventually have applications in games development, including game testing or game\ndesign (Jacob et al., 2020; Gillberg et al., 2023).\nIn the past, video game research often necessitated close integration with the games themselves to\nobtain game-specific information and establish a scalable interface for training agents. Considering\nthe costs associated with domain expertise and engineering efforts required for close integration,\n∗Work\nwas\nconducted\nduring\nan\ninternship\nat\nMicrosoft\nResearch.\nCorrespondence\nat\nl.schaefer@ed.ac.uk\n1\narXiv:2312.02312v1  [cs.LG]  4 Dec 2023\nPreprint\nour focus is on training agents to play video games in a human-like manner, receiving only images\nfrom the game and producing actions corresponding to controller joystick and button inputs. To\neliminate integration costs during training, we use behavior cloning to train agents entirely offline,\nutilising previously collected human gameplay data. Although prior research has explored encoding\nimages into lower-dimensional representations for behavior cloning, these studies primarily targeted\nrobotics applications (Nair et al., 2022), where images often resemble real-world scenes. Inspired\nby the challenges and potential applications in video games, we investigate the following research\nquestion: How can images be encoded for data-efficient imitation learning in modern video games?\nTowards our guiding research question, we compare both end-to-end trained visual encoders and\npre-trained visual encoders in three modern video games: Minecraft, Minecraft Dungeons and\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). We examine 12 distinct end-to-end trained visual en-\ncoders, varying in network architecture (Residual Networks (ResNets) (He et al., 2016a;b) or Vision\nTransformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Steiner et al., 2022)), image input size, and the ap-\nplication of image augmentations. In contrast, pre-trained visual encoders are often trained on large\ndatasets containing diverse real-world images, potentially providing useful and generalisable rep-\nresentations without additional training. However, it remains uncertain how well these pre-trained\nencoders perform in video games, which often exhibit substantial differences from real-world im-\nages. We identify four primary categories of training paradigms among pre-trained visual encoders\nand train agents using the representations from a total of 10 different pre-trained encoders spanning\nall these categories: (1) self-supervised trained encoders (e.g. DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2023)), (2)\nlanguage-contrastive trained encoders (e.g. OpenAI CLIP (Radford et al., 2021)), (3) supervised\ntrained encoders (e.g. Imagenet classification trained FocalNet (Yang et al., 2022)), and (4) recon-\nstruction trained encoders (e.g. the encoder of a variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling,\n2013)). Finally, inspired by the cost associated with collecting human gameplay data and the hy-\npothesis that pre-trained encoders could be advantageous in the absence of extensive training data,\nwe investigate the performance of these visual encoders across varying amounts of training data.\nOur results show that even though visual encoders trained end-to-end in complex video games can be\neffective with relatively small 128×128 images and limited amounts of high-quality data, substantial\nimprovements can be achieved by employing pre-trained encoders, especially DINOv2.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nLearning Agents in Video Games. Video games have often served as benchmarks for decision-\nmaking agents, leading to impressive performance in modern video games where a programmatic in-\nterface (Vinyals et al., 2019; Berner et al., 2019) or large quantities of expert demonstrations (Baker\net al., 2022; Fan et al., 2022; Reed et al., 2022) are available for training. Recent work directly\nleverages or fine-tunes pre-trained foundation models to collect training data (Cai et al., 2023a) or\nguide action selection (Wang et al., 2023; Lifshitz et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b), but games without\nsuch close integration, extensive datasets or pre-trained models have seen comparably little research\nattention. Pearce & Zhu (2022) used imitation learning to train agents to play CS:GO with a com-\nbination of online scraped gameplay and expert demonstrations. Similarly, Kanervisto et al. (2020)\nbenchmarked imitation learning agents across a diverse set of video games, including six modern\ngames without programmatic interfaces. They emulated keyboard and mouse inputs to take actions\nin these games, akin to our approach. However, their study was limited to relatively simple visual\nencoders and agents did not leverage temporal history used in most recent decision-making agents.\nVisual Encoders for Imitation Learning. Prior research has compared pre-trained visual encoders\nto those trained end-to-end using imitation learning for robotic applications (Nair et al., 2022; Yuan\net al., 2022). These studies generally found that pre-trained encoders exhibit better generality and\nperformance than those trained on smaller, task-specific data sets. However, given the real-world\nnature of robotics and the availability of datasets, it remains uncertain how these findings translate\nto the realm of video games. Our study seeks to bridge this gap.\nVisual Encoders for Video Games. In the context of video games, pre-trained visual models have\nbeen employed to extract visual representations that differentiate between genres and styles (Trivedi\net al., 2023), indicating their ability to detect relevant features in games. However, domain-specific\nmodels trained using self-supervised representation learning techniques can yield higher-quality rep-\nresentations than certain pre-trained visual encoders (Trivedi et al., 2022). Our study expands upon\n2\nPreprint\nVisual\nEncoder\nPolicy\nActions\nMLP\n512\nLSTM 512\nLSTM\nMLP\n512\nActions\nPolicy\nFigure 2: Architecture illustration: Core network architecture used throughout all the experiments.\nprevious experiments by concentrating on modern video games and examining a broad spectrum of\nrecent pre-trained and end-to-end trained visual encoder architectures.\n3\nIMITATION LEARNING FOR VIDEO GAMES FROM PIXELS\n3.1\nBEHAVIOUR CLONING\nBehavior cloning (BC) is an imitation learning approach that trains agents through supervised learn-\ning using a dataset of provided demonstrations, denoted as D = (o1, a1), . . . , (oN, aN), where N\nrepresents the total number of samples in the dataset. Each demonstration comprises tuples (o, a),\nwhich correspond to the image observation o and the human player’s chosen action a at a specific\npoint during training. Using this data, a policy π(a | o; θ) is trained to mimic the distribution of\nactions found in D, based on the current image observed, by minimising the loss\nL(θ) = E(o,a)∼D,ˆa∼π(·|o;θ) [l(a, ˆa)]\n(1)\nwhere l measures the discrepancy between the ”true” action a and the policy’s sampled action ˆa. For\ncontinuous and discrete actions, we use the mean-squared error and cross-entropy loss, respectively.\n3.2\nIMAGE PROCESSING\nReceived images, sampled from the dataset during training or directly from the game during eval-\nuation, are first resized to the required image size of the respective visual encoder (see Table 1)1.\nIf image augmentation is used for an encoder, images are augmented after resizing using the same\naugmentations applied by Baker et al. (2022). Finally, image colour values are normalised.\n3.3\nARCHITECTURE\nThe architecture of all trained agents is illustrated in Figure 2, and Table 1 lists all visual encoders\nconsidered in our experiments. The processed image ot is fed through the visual encoder to obtain\nan embedding zt. The policy receives this embedding and outputs actions at for the respective game.\nPolicy Network. For all experiments, the policy architecture remains identical. First, the received\nembedding zt is projected to 512 dimensions with a MLP with one hidden layer of dimension 512\nbefore being fed through a two-layered LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) with hidden di-\nmensions of 512. The LSTM processes the projected embedding and a hidden state ht−1 which\nrepresents the history of previously received embeddings during a sequence (obtained either as a\nsampled sequence during training or online evaluation). Following the two-layered LSTM, a MLP\nwith one hidden layer of 512 dimensions is used to project the 512-dimensional representation out-\nputted by the LSTM to as many dimensions as there are actions. At each intermediate layer, the\nReLU activation function is applied.\nEnd-to-End Visual Encoders. For visual encoders trained end-to-end with the BC loss, we con-\nsider three ResNet (He et al., 2016a;b) and three vision transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021;\nSteiner et al., 2022) architectures. The Impala (Espeholt et al., 2018) ResNet architecture is a com-\nmonly used visual encoder for decision making agents but designed for smaller image sizes than\n128 × 128 and, thus, outputs large embeddings. For comparison, we evaluate two alternative larger\n1For the resizing, we use linear interpolation for end-to-end encoders and bicubic interpolation for all pre-\ntrained encoders to be consistent with the processing pipeline used during training of the pre-trained encoders.\n3\nPreprint\nTable 1: Overview of all visual encoder architectures considered in this study including the type\nof training category, image sizes, parameter counts and the size of computed embeddings.

For ViTs, we evaluate the commonly used tiny model architecture proposed\nby Steiner et al. (2022) which outputs fairly small embeddings. For comparison, we also evaluate\ntwo alternative architectures with slightly larger models that output comparably larger embeddings.\nSee Appendix A.1 for full details on all end-to-end visual encoder architectures.\nPre-Trained Visual Encoders. We consider four paradigms of pre-trained visual encoders with rep-\nresentative models being evaluated in our experiments: OpenAI’s CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) as lan-\nguage contrastive pre-trained encoders, DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2023) as self-supervised pre-trained\nencoders with self-distillation objectives between a teacher and student network, FocalNet (Yang\net al., 2022) trained on ImageNet21K classification as supervised pre-trained encoders, and a varia-\ntional autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2013) from stable diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022)\nas reconstruction pre-trained encoder. These visual encoders have already been trained on large\namounts of real-world images. During all our experiments, we freeze these encoders and only use\nthem to obtain embeddings of images without any fine-tuning or further training. For details on\nthe models used, see Appendix A.2, and for details on the network architecture, training data, and\nfurther considerations of these encoders we refer to the original papers.\nTraining Configuration. For each network update, we sample 32 random sequences of 100 consec-\nutive image-action pairs within the dataset. Before each training step, the hidden state and cell state\nof the LSTMs in the policy are reset and the mean BC loss is computed across all sequences with the\nhidden state accumulating across the 100 samples within a sequence. The Adam optimiser (Kingma\n& Ba, 2014) is used with decoupled weight decay (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) of 0.01 and a learn-\ning rate of 3 · 10−4. To stabilise training, gradients are normalised at 1.0 and we use half precision\nfor all training. In Minecraft Dungeons, we train each model for 1 million gradient updates. In\nMinecraft and CS:GO, models are trained for 500,000 gradient updates.\n4\nVIDEO GAMES FOR EVALUATION\nWe train and evaluate BC models with all visual encoders in three different games, Minecraft Dun-\ngeons, Minecraft and CS:GO, illustrated in Figure 1. Below, we will outline details regarding the\ntraining data and action space for each game.\n4\nPreprint\n4.1\nMINECRAFT DUNGEONS\nMinecraft Dungeons is an action-adventure role-playing video game with isometric camera view\ncentered on the player. The player controls the movement and actions (including dodge roll, attack,\nuse health potion, use items) of a single character which is kept in the center of the video frame (as\nseen in Figure 1a). The player has to complete diverse levels by following and completing several\nobjectives. In our evaluation, we focus on the “Arch Haven” level of Minecraft Dungeons which\ncontains fighting against several types of enemies and navigation across visually diverse terrain.\nDataset. Before data collection, we pre-registered this study with our Institutional Review Board\n(IRB) who advised on the drafting of our participant instructions to ensure informed consent. After\ntheir approval, four players2 played the “Arch Haven” level, and game frames at 1280 × 720 resolu-\ntion, actions (joystick positions and button presses on a controller), and character position within the\nlevel were captured. The dataset includes a total of 139 recorded trajectories with more than eight\nhours of gameplay at 30Hz. Individual demonstrations vary between 160 and 380 seconds which\ncorresponds to 4,800 and 11,400 recorded actions, respectively. We use 80% of the data for training\nand reserve 20% for validation. Each player was instructed to complete the level using a fixed char-\nacter equipped with only the starting equipment of a sword and bow, and most players followed the\nimmediate path towards level completion.\nAction space. Agents have access to all effective controls in Minecraft Dungeons, including the x-\nand y-positions of both joysticks, the right trigger position (for shooting the bow), and ten buttons.\nThe most frequently used buttons during recordings control sword attacks, bow shooting, healing\npotions, and forward dodging.\nOnline evaluation. To evaluate the quality of trained BC policies, we rollout the policy in the game\nwith actions being queried at 10Hz (see Appendix D for details). These actions are then taken in\nthe game using Xbox controller emulation software. Each rollout spawns the agent in the beginning\nof the “Arch Haven” level and queries actions until five minutes passed (3,000 actions) or the agent\ndies four times resulting in the level being failed. We run 20 rollouts per trained agent and report the\nprogression throughout the level (Appendix C).\n4.2\nMINECRAFT\nMinecraft is a game that lets players create and explore a world made of breakable cubes. Players\ncan gather resources, craft items and fight enemies in this open-world sandbox game. Minecraft is\nalso a useful platform for AI research, where different learning algorithms can be tested and com-\npared (Johnson et al., 2016). We use the MineRL (Guss et al., 2019; Baker et al., 2022) environment,\nwhich connects Minecraft with Python and allows us to control the agents and the environment. We\nuse MineRL version 1.0.2, which has been used for large-scale imitation learning experiments be-\nfore (Baker et al., 2022), and which offers simpler mouse and keyboard input than previous MineRL\nversions (Guss et al., 2019).\nTask and online evaluation. To evaluate our BC models, we use the “Treechop” task; after spawn-\ning to a new, randomly generated world, the player has to chop a single log of a tree within 1 minute.\nThis is the first step to craft many of the items in Minecraft, and has been previously used to bench-\nmark reinforcement learning algorithms (Guss et al., 2019). See Figure 1b for a screenshot of the\nstarting state. The agent observes the shown image pixels in first-person perspective, can move the\nplayer around and attack to chop trees. For reporting the performance of trained models, we rollout\neach model for 100 episodes with the same world seeds, and record the number of trees the player\nchopped. If the player chopped at least one tree within the first minute, the episode is counted as a\nsuccess, otherwise it is counted as a failure (the timeout is set to 1 minute).\nDataset. We use the Minecraft dataset released with the OpenAI VPT model (Baker et al., 2022)\nto select demonstrations of tree chopping. We choose the 6.13 version of the dataset and filter it to\n40 minutes of human demonstrations that start from a fresh world and chop a tree within 1 minute.\nWe also remove any erroneous files that remain after the filtering. The demonstrations include the\nimage pixels seen by the human player at 640 × 360 resolution and the keyboard and mouse state at\nthe same time, recorded at 20Hz. We also run the models at 20Hz.\n2120 recordings were collected by one player with the remaining 19 recordings being roughly evenly split\nacross the other three players.\n5\nPreprint\nbeach\ngate\npath\nstairs\nbooks\ncave\nProgression zone\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nProgression percentage\nImpala ResNet\nResNet 128\nResNet 256\nNo Augmentation\n(a) End-to-end ResNets\nbeach\ngate\npath\nstairs\nbooks\ncave\nProgression zone\nViT Tiny\nViT 128\nViT 256\nNo Augmentation\n(b) End-to-end ViTs\nbeach\ngate\npath\nstairs\nbooks\ncave\nProgression zone\nCLIP RN50\nDINO ViT-S\/14\nFocal Large\nSD VAE\nLarger\nLargest\n(c) Pre-trained encoders\nFigure 3: Online evaluation progression for BC agents in Minecraft Dungeons with (a) end-to-\nend ResNets, (b) end-to-end ViTs, and (c) pre-trained visual encoders. We visualise the mean and\nstandard deviation, computed over three training seeds, of the percentage of rollouts progressing\nthrough each of the objective zones within the “Arch Haven” level. Results for the ViT Tiny model\nare only aggregated over two seeds, as one seed resulted in an invalid checkpoint.\n4.3\nCOUNTER-STRIKE: GLOBAL OFFENSIVE\nCS:GO is a first-person shooter game designed for competitive, five versus five games. The core\nskill of the game is accurate aiming and handling the weapon recoil\/sway as the weapon is fired.\nPrevious work has used CS:GO as a benchmark to train and test behavioural cloning models (Pearce\net al., 2023), with best models able to outperform easier bots (Pearce & Zhu, 2022). We incorporate\nexperiments using CS:GO, as it offers visuals more similar to the real-world images that most pre-\ntrained visual encoders were trained on, in contrast to our primary evaluation in Minecraft Dungeons\nand Minecraft (see Figure 1c).\nFollowing Pearce et al. (2023), we use the “Clean aim train” dataset and setup. The controlled\nplayer is placed in the middle of an arena, and random enemies are spawned around them who try\nto reach the player. The player can not move; they can only aim to different directions (Figure 1c).\nThe dataset contains 45 minutes of expert-human gameplay from one player, recorded at 16Hz. To\nevaluate models, we run each model for three rollouts of five minutes each, and report the average\nand standard deviation of the kills-per-minute.\n5\nEVALUATION\nIn our evaluation, we focus on the guiding question of how to encode images for data-efficient im-\nitation learning in modern video games. The evaluation is structured in four experiments studying\n(1) which end-to-end visual encoder is most effective, (2) which pre-trained encoder is most effec-\ntive, (3) how do the best end-to-end and pre-trained visual encoders compare under varying amounts\nof training data, and (4) how do the best visual encoders compare in a video game with visuals\nmore akin to the real-world. For each experiment, we train each model with three different seeds\nand report aggregated training and online evaluation metrics. Lastly, we visually inspect the visual\nencoders with respect to the information they attend to during action selection. An outline of the\ncomputational resources used for training and evaluation can be found in Appendix G.\n5.1\nHOW TO CHOOSE END-TO-END VISUAL ENCODERS?\nTo identify which end-to-end visual encoder is the most effective, we train all six end-to-end visual\nencoder architectures (listed in Table 1) with and without image augmentations using the BC loss.\nFigures 3a and 3b visualise the online evaluation performance for all models with end-to-end ResNet\nand ViT visual encoders, respectively, in Minecraft Dungeons. We observe that image augmentation\nconsistently improves online performance, leading to models that more robustly progress further.\nResNet image encoders slightly outperform ViT models, but by no significant margins. Lastly,\nno notable difference can be observed for end-to-end encoders trained on images of 128 × 128 or\n6\nPreprint\nTable 2: Minecraft online evaluation of agent success rate chopping a single tree with end-to-end\ntrained (left) and pre-trained (right) visual encoders.

These results suggest that comparably small images of 128×128 are sufficient\neven for complex video games like Minecraft Dungeons. In Minecraft (Table 2, left half), we also\nobserve that the input image size has no significant effect on the results. However, ViT 256 and\nViT Tiny outperform most ResNets by statistically significant margins (double-tailed Welch’s test,\np < 0.05) without image augmentations.\nThese results suggest two main findings: (1) Small images of 128 × 128 can be sufficient to train\nagents in complex modern video games, and (2) image augmentation has the potential to signifi-\ncantly improve performance but is game-specific.\n5.2\nHOW TO CHOOSE PRE-TRAINED VISUAL ENCODERS?\nTo identify most suitable pre-trained visual encoders for video games, we compare BC agents trained\nwith the representations of 10 pre-trained encoders. These encoders are frozen during BC training.\nIn Minecraft Dungeons (Figure 3c) and MineCraft (Table 2, right half), we find that BC models\nwith DINOv2 visual encoders generally outperform other models. In Minecraft Dungeons, the BC\nmodels trained with DINOv2 ViT-B\/14 pre-trained encoder outperforms all other models, including\nany end-to-end trained visual encoder. The stable diffusion encoder still outperforms FocalNet and\nCLIP visual encoders, but performs notably worse than all DINOv2 models. In Minecraft, the\nlargest DINOv2 ViT-L\/14, significantly (p < 0.05) outperforms all but the noisiest models (Tiny\nViT, ViT 128 +Aug, Stable Diffusion and CLIP ResNet 50). While smaller DINOv2 models appear\nbetter than FocalNet or CLIP, their results are not significantly different from ViT-B\/14 and ViT-S\/14\nDINOv2 models. Stable diffusion VAE works similarly to smaller DINOv2 models in Minecraft.\nLastly, we observe that there is no clear correlation between the model size of pre-trained encoders\nand online performance. While larger DINOv2 models perform best in Minecraft, the same trend\ndoes not hold for CLIP and FocalNet where encoders with fewer parameters perform better.\n5.3\nHOW MUCH DATA DO YOU NEED?\nA significant advantage of utilising pre-trained visual encoders is their independence from additional\ntraining, potentially resulting in more reliable performance with limited data. In contrast, visual\nencoders specifically trained for a particular task may be less generalisable but have the potential to\noutperform general-purpose pre-trained encoders. To test this hypothesis, we examine how the top-\nperforming end-to-end and pre-trained visual encoders (based on online evaluation performance)\ncompare with varying amounts of data.\nIn Minecraft Dungeons, we select the DINOv2 ViT-S\/14, ViT-B\/14 models, as well as the ResNet\nand ViT architectures on 128 × 128 images and image augmentation as the best-performing pre-\n7\nPreprint\nbeach\ngate\npath\nstairs\nbooks\ncave\nProgression zone\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nProgression percentage\nResNet 128 +Aug\nViT 128 +Aug\nDINO ViT-S\/14\nDINO ViT-B\/14\n50% Data\n25% Data\nFigure 4: Online evaluation progression for\nthe best-performing BC agents in Minecraft\nDungeons with the full dataset (solid line)\nand subparts of the dataset.\nTable 3: Online evaluation performance for the\nbest-performing BC agents in Minecraft with the\nfull dataset and 10% of the dataset.\nModel name\nSuccess rate (%)\nViT 256 (Full)\n24.33± 0.94\nViT 256 (10%)\n10.33± 1.70\nViT Tiny (Full)\n23.33± 4.19\nViT Tiny (10%)\n16.50± 1.50\nDINOv2 ViT-L\/14 (Full)\n32.00± 1.63\nDINOv2 ViT-L\/14 (10%)\n15.00± 2.16\nDINOv2 ViT-B\/14 (Full)\n25.33± 2.05\nDINOv2 ViT-B\/14 (10%)\n17.00± 1.41\ntrained and end-to-end trained encoders, respectively. We generate two reduced datasets with 50%\n(∼4 hours) and 25% (∼2 hours) of the training data by sampling trajectories uniformly at ran-\ndom. Each of the selected models is then trained on the 50% and 25% training datasets for 500 and\n250 thousand gradient updates, respectively. Figure 4 shows the online evaluation performance of\nall models. As expected, we can see that the performance of all models gradually deteriorates as\nthe training data is reduced. For pre-trained models, the larger DINOv2 ViT-B\/14 outperforms the\nsmaller ViT-S\/14 when dealing with smaller datasets. Regarding end-to-end trained models, the ViT\nmodel’s performance declines more rapidly with smaller data quantities compared to the ResNet.\nHowever, contrary to expectations, both end-to-end trained visual encoders yield performance com-\nparable to pre-trained models in lower data regimes.\nIn Minecraft, we also experimented with a low-data regime by using only 10% (∼3.5 minutes, 14\ndemonstrations, 4269 steps of data) of gameplay data. The results for the two best end-to-end and\npre-trained models are shown in Table 3. The success rate drops by half for all models, but it is still\nbetter than some models in the full experiments. This is surprising considering the small amount\nof data. Similar to Minecraft Dungeons, there is no significant difference between pre-trained and\nend-to-end visual encoders, suggesting that either of them could work well with less than 5 minutes\nof high-quality demonstration data. However, contrary to Minecraft Dungeons, there is no clear\ndifference between both DINOv2 encoders in the lower data regime, suggesting that there is no\nclear correlation between model size and online performance in the very low data regime.\n5.4\nGRAD-CAM INSPECTION OF VISUAL ENCODERS\nTo understand what information is captured by visual encoders at various times in the games, we\nuse gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) (Selvaraju et al., 2017) to inspect each\ntrained visual encoder. We visualise the Grad-CAM activations of visual encoders for images in\nMinecraft Dungeons and Minecraft with action logits of trained BC policies serving as the targets,\nthese can be interpreted as which parts of the image are most relevant for the visual encoder during\naction selection. For more details on the Grad-CAM visualisations, plots for more game screenshots\nin both games and all visual encoders, see Appendix F.\nFigure 5 shows the Grad-CAM activations for the best-performing visual encoders in both Minecraft\nDungeons and Minecraft. In Minecraft Dungeons, many visual encoders tend to focus on the parts\nof the image containing the player character and enemy units. We hypothesise that other activations\nmight correspond to way points the models focus on to navigate through the level. In Minecraft,\nmost visual encoders tend to focus on parts indicative of nearby terrain, wood, and the progress of\nchopping a tree, aligning with the objective of the task.\n8\nPreprint\n(a) Original\n(b) RN 128 +Aug\n(c) ViT 128 +Aug\n(d) DINOv2 ViT-S\n(e) DINOv2 ViT-B\n(f) Original\n(g) ViT 256\n(h) ViT Tiny\n(i) DINOv2 ViT-L\n(j) DINOv2 ViT-B\nFigure 5: Grad-CAM visualisation of the activation of the best-performing visual encoders for\nMinecraft Dungeons (top) and Minecraft (bottom) with action logits of a BC policy serving as tar-\ngets.

Initially, we hypothesised that the image\nprocessing in CS:GO3 might be the cause for the poor online performance of DINOv2. However,\nfurther investigation with four pre-trained visual encoders in Minecraft (detailed in Appendix E)\nindicates that pre-trained visual encoders are not as sensitive to the image processing as hypothe-\nsised from the performance of DINOv2 ViT-S\/14 in CS:GO. Even with similar image processing as\napplied in CS:GO, agents trained with pre-trained visual encoders were able to exhibit performance\ncomparable to our original findings in Minecraft. We leave further investigation into the efficacy of\npre-trained visual encoders in CS:GO and the observed failure of DINOv2 for future work.\n6\nCONCLUSION\nIn this study, we systematically evaluated the effectiveness of imitation learning in modern video\ngames by comparing the conventional end-to-end training of task-specific visual encoders with the\nuse of publicly available pre-trained encoders. Our findings revealed that training visual encoders\nend-to-end on relatively small images can yield strong performance when using high-quality, repre-\nsentative data for the evaluation task, even in low-data regimes of few hours or minutes. DINOv2,\ntrained with self-supervised objectives on diverse data, consistently outperformed other pre-trained\nvisual encoders, indicating its generality and suitability for video games. Interestingly, agents us-\ning these pre-trained visual encoders demonstrated performance comparable (or superior) to those\n3The CS:GO dataset contains images at a resolution of 280×150 but images have to be resized to 224×224\nfor DINOv2. This up-scaling of the image height after initial down-scaling during the dataset collection differs\nfrom the image processing applied during the pre-training of DINOv2.\n9\nPreprint\nemploying game-specific visual encoders across different data volumes. However, careful attention\nmust be given to image resizing and processing as seen in CS:GO. Overall, our results suggest that\nthe use of effective pre-trained visual encoders, such as DINOv2, should be seriously considered in\nthe context of modern video games.\nIn order to maintain focus and feasibility in our study, we concentrated on a specific set of visual\nencoders, enabling a range of comparisons between different architectures and pre-trained model\nparadigms. Nevertheless, our study could be complemented by exploring additional comparison\npoints, such as diverse supervised-trained pre-trained encoder architectures and additional scenarios\nwithin the examined or other video games. Although our study focused on settings with available\ntraining data for the evaluation task, future work could explore the potential benefits of pre-trained\nvisual encoders when agents need to generalise across diverse levels or maps with variable visuals.\nREFERENCES\nBowen Baker, Ilge Akkaya, Peter Zhokov, Joost Huizinga, Jie Tang, Adrien Ecoffet, Brandon\nHoughton, Raul Sampedro, and Jeff Clune.

(2018) consisting of a 3×3 convolution with stride 1,\nmax pooling with 3×3 kernels and stride 2 followed by two residual blocks of two 3×3 convolutions\nwith stride 1. This joint block is repeated three times with 16, 32, and 32 channels, respectively.\nCustom ResNet\nThe architecture for our custom ResNet models is modelled after Liu et al. (2022)\nand illustrated in detail in Figure 6.\nConv2d \n \n,\nstride=4, padding=3\nConv2d \n \n,\nstride=1, padding=3\nGroupNorm\nConv2d \n \n,\nstride=1, padding=0\nGeLU\nConv2d \n \n,\nstride=1, padding=0\nGroupNorm\nConv2d \n \n,\nstride=2, padding=1\nRepeat for \nGeLU\nLayerNorm\nFigure 6: Illustration of the architecture of our custom ResNet visual encoders for 128 × 128 and\n256 × 256 images.\nViT\nOur ViT architectures are all based on the reference implementation at https:\/\/github.\ncom\/lucidrains\/vit-pytorch\/blob\/main\/vit_pytorch\/vit.py. For all models,\nwe use no dropout, and the following configurations are used across the considered ViT visual\nencoders:\nModel name\nPatch size\nNum layers\nWidth\nMLP dim\nNum heads\nViT Tiny\n16\n12\n192\n768\n3\nCustom ViT\n16\n4\n512\n512\n12\nTable 5: Configurations of end-to-end ViT models.\nThe ViT Tiny architecture follows the suggested architecture of Steiner et al. (2022). In contrast,\nboth custom ViT for 128 × 128 and 256 × 256 have notably fewer layers, wider dimensions of the\nattention layers and no increase of dimensions in the MLP projections. In our experiments, we found\nthat such an architecture resulted in better online evaluation performance in several video games.\nImage augmentations\nIf image augmentations are applied during training, we randomly augment\nimages after the down-scaling process. We implement all augmentations with the torchvision\nlibrary and randomly sample augmentations during training. We apply the following augmentations\nas described by Baker et al. (2022):\n• Change colour hue by a random factor between -0.2 and 0.2\n• Change colour saturation with a random factor between 0.8 and 1.2\n• Change brightness with a random factor between 0.8 and 1.2\n• Change colour contrast with a random factor between 0.8 and 1.2\n• Randomly rotate the image between -2 and 2 degrees\n• Scale the image with a random factor between 0.98 and 1.02 in each dimension\n• Apply a random shear to the image between -2 and 2 degrees\n• Randomly translate the image between -2 and 2 pixels in both the x- and y-direction\n13\nPreprint\nA.2\nPRE-TRAINED VISUAL ENCODERS\nIn this section, we will detail the sources for all pre-trained visual encoders considered in our eval-\nuation.\nOpenAI CLIP\nFor the visual encoders of OpenAI’s CLIP models (Radford et al., 2021), we use\nthe official interface available at https:\/\/github.com\/openai\/CLIP. We use the following\nmodels from this repository: ”RN50” (ResNet 50), ”ViT-B\/16”, and ”ViT-L\/14”. In preliminary\nexperiments, we found the available larger ResNet models to provide no significant improvements\nin online evaluation performance and the ViT model with a larger patch size of 32 to perform worse\nthan the chosen ViT models with patch sizes of 16 and 14.\nDINOv2\nFor the DINOv2 pre-trained visual encoders (Oquab et al., 2023), we use the official in-\nterface available at https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/dinov2. Due to the com-\nputational cost, we do not evaluate the non-distilled ViT-G\/14 checkpoint with 1.1 billion parame-\nters.\nFocalNet\nFor the FocalNet pre-trained visual encoders (Yang et al., 2022), we used the Hugging\nFace timm library (https:\/\/huggingface.co\/docs\/timm\/index) to load the pre-trained\nmodels for its ease of use. We use the FocalNet models pre-trained on ImageNet-22K classification\nwith 4 focal layers: ”focalnet large fl4”, ”focalnet xlarge fl4”, and ”focalnet huge fl4”.\nStable Diffusion\nFor the pre-trained stable diffusion 2.1 VAE encoder, we use the Hugging\nFace checkpoint of the model available at https:\/\/huggingface.co\/stabilityai\/\nsdxl-vae. This model can be accessed with the diffusers library. In contrast to other encoders,\nthe VAE outputs a Gaussian distribution of embeddings rather than an individual embedding for a\ngiven image. We use the mode of the distribution of a given image as its embedding since (1) we\nwant to keep the embeddings of the frozen encoder for a given image deterministic, and (2) we find\nthe standard deviation to be neglectable for most inputs.\nB\nADDITIONAL EVALUATION DATA\nIn this section, we provide additional insight into our evaluation.\nMinecraft Dungeons\nFigure 7a (top) shows the training loss for all models with end-to-end visual\nencoders in Minecraft Dungeons. From the training loss, we can see that image augmentations\ngenerally increase the training loss despite improving online performance as seen in Figures 3a\nand 3b. We also note that training for the custom ResNet with 256 × 256 images and the Impala\nResNet exhibit high dispersion across three seeds, leading to large shading and stagnation of the\nloss early in training. We hypothesise that this occurs for the Impala ResNet due to the overly large\nembeddings which complicate learning a policy with BC.\nFor BC models with pre-trained visual encoders, the training loss shown in Figure 7b appears com-\nparably similar for most models. Only the reconstruction-based stable diffusion encoder and the\nCLIP ResNet50 models stand out since they outperform and underperform all other models, respec-\ntively.\nComparing the training loss of BC models trained with end-to-end and pre-trained visual encoders\nfurther shows that end-to-end encoders trained without image augmentation are capable of reaching\nlower losses. We hypothesise that this occurs since the end-to-end trained encoders are specialised\nto perform well on the exact training data the loss is computed over.\nMinecraft\nIn contrast, the training loss in Minecraft (Figure 7 bottom) quickly stagnates and con-\nverges to similarly low values for all end-to-end and pre-trained encoders.\nCS:GO\nIn CS:GO, the training loss improves all throughout training for all three trained models\nwith the models trained with DINOv2 ViT-S\/14 pre-trained encoders achieving the lowest training\nloss.

We highlight that these end-to-end trained\nvisual encoders are trained with image augmentations whereas the models with DINOv2 pre-trained\nencoders are not. Such image augmentations have been seen to consistently increase the training loss\nin Minecraft Dungeons and might be the main reason for the higher training loss of the end-to-end\ntrained models.\nC\nMINECRAFT DUNGEONS ARCH HAVEN LEVEL\nTo measure progress for the online evaluation in Minecraft Dungeons, we define boundaries of zones\nwhich determine the progression throughout the ”Arch Haven” level we evaluate in.

The heatmap also shows the path followed by most demonstrations towards\ncompletion of the level.\nD\nMINECRAFT DUNGEONS ACTION FREQUENCY IN ONLINE EVALUATION\nThe visual encoders used in our evaluation have vastly different model sizes (see Table 1) and,\nthus, notably different computational cost at inference time.

We attempt to take actions during evaluation at\n10Hz to match the action selection frequency of the (processed) training data, in particular due to the\nrecurrent architecture of our policy. However, we are unable to perfectly match this frequency for all\nvisual encoders on the hardware used to conduct the evaluation (see Appendix G for specifications\non the hardware used during training and online evaluation) despite using a more powerful GPU for\npre-trained visual encoders due to their comparably large size.\nTable 6 lists the average action frequencies of all models during online evaluation in Minecraft\nDungeons across all runs conducted as part of our evaluation. We note that most end-to-end trained\nvisual encoders enable fast inference achieving close to 10 Hz action frequency. The ViT Tiny model\nis the slowest model, likely due to its deeper 12 layers in comparison to the other end-to-end trained\nViT models with 4 layers as shown in Table 5, but we are still able to take actions at more than\n8.5Hz. For pre-trained visual encoders, we see comparably fast action frequencies for all CLIP and\nmost DINOv2 models as. The largest DINOv2 and stable diffusion VAE have notably slower action\nfrequencies, but the FocalNet models induced the highest inference cost. However, we highlight that\nwe did not observe behaviour during online evaluation which would suggest that these models were\nsignificantly inhibited due to this discrepancy.\n16\nPreprint\nTable 6: Average action frequencies during online evaluation in Minecraft Dungeons across 60 runs\nper model (20 for each seed).\nModel name\nAction freq.

We hypothesised that the cause of this poor performance in CS:GO is\nthe image resizing. The CS:GO dataset includes images cropped and down-scaled to a resolution of\n280×150 whereas DINOv2 pre-trained visual encoders (and most other pre-trained visual encoders)\nexpect image sizes of 224 × 224. Therefore, images are down-scaled from a higher resolution to\n280 × 150 during data collection and then up-scaled again to 224 × 224. We hypothesise that\nthis resizing causes discrepancies in the resulting images compared to the expected processing of\nresizing images from a higher resolution directly to 224 × 224.\nTo verify this hypothesis, we conduct experiments in Minecraft instead of CS:GO since the dataset\nin CS:GO is only available with images of 280 × 150. In our original evaluation in Minecraft, we\ndown-scaled images from a higher resolution of 640 × 360 to the respective resolution required by\neach visual encoder during training. To mimic the situation in CS:GO and separate the confound-\ning factors of down-scaling followed by up-scaling and squared and non-squared aspect ratios, we\nconsider two alternative image processing:\n1. CS:GO-like processing: We down-scale images to width 280 (keeping aspect ratio), crop\nto 280 × 150 from the middle, and re-size from this resolution to the resolution required by\nthe respective visual encoder.\n2. Squared aspect ratio: We down-scale images from the dataset to 150 × 150 and re-size\nfrom this resolution to the resolution required by the respective visual encoder.\nThe first processing allows us to study how different visual encoders are affected by processing\nas done in CS:GO, whereas the second processing allows us to study how the same experiment\nbehaves if squared aspect ratio is retained all throughout the process. We train and evaluate the\nbest performing pre-trained visual encoder of each family of models (following Table 2) with the\nrespective processing.\nTable 7 shows the online evaluation performance of models trained with four different pre-trained en-\ncoders either using the original image processing, CS:GO-like processing, or the described squared\nprocessing. As we can see, the large DINOv2 as well as the CLIP ResNet encoder perform com-\nparable for both the original processing and the CS:GO-like processing, but the performance of the\nFocalNet and Stable Diffusion encoders deteriorates slightly. Furthermore, all but the Stable Diffu-\nsion visual encoder perform best with the squared processing. Models trained with this processing,\nwhich ensures a squared aspect ratio for the initial down-scaling, perform best in terms of average\nperformance and exhibit notably lower deviation across two runs. Overall, these results indicate that\nthe processing applied in CS:GO is not necessarily detrimental to the performance of trained agents\n17\nPreprint\nTable 7: Minecraft online evaluation of agent success rate chopping a single tree with varying visual\nencoders and image processing.

We leave further investigation into the\nefficacy of pre-trained visual encoders for decision making in CS:GO for future work.\nF\nGRAD-CAM VISUALISATIONS\nTo generate Grad-CAM (Selvaraju et al., 2017) visualisations, we use the library available at\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/jacobgil\/pytorch-grad-cam. We use all actions of the pol-\nicy trained on the embeddings of each visual encoder as the target concept to analyse, and visualise\nthe average Grad-CAM plot across all actions. Following https:\/\/github.com\/jacobgil\/\npytorch-grad-cam#chosing-the-target-layer, we use the activations of these lay-\ners within the visual encoders to compute visualisations for:\n• ResNet:

Dungeons\nFor Minecraft Dungeons, end-to-end training runs for Impala ResNet, cus-\ntom ResNets (for 128 × 128 and 256 × 256 images) and custom ViT for 128 × 128 images without\nimage augmentation have been done on four 16GB V100s for each run. Training runs for the same\nmodels with image augmentation have been run on one A6000 GPU (with 48GB of VRAM) for\neach run. Training the ViT Tiny and ViT model for 256 × 256 images needed more VRAMs, so\nthese were trained on eight 16GB V100s for each run.\nFor training runs using pre-trained visual encoders, we computed the embeddings of all images in\nthe Minecraft Dungeons dataset prior to training for more efficient training using A6000 GPUs.\nAfter, we were able to train each model using pre-trained visual encoders with four 16GB V100s for\na single run.\nTo train models on half or a quarter of the training data for the third set of experiments, we used four\n16GB V100s for a single run of any configuration.\nSince the Minecraft Dungeons game is unable to run on Linux servers, we used Azure virtual ma-\nchines running Windows 10 for the online evaluation. For evaluation of end-to-end trained models,\nwe use a machine with two M60 GPUs, 24 CPU cores and 224GB of RAM. However, we noticed\nthat this configuration was insufficient to evaluate models with larger pre-trained visual encoders at\nthe desired 10Hz. Therefore, we used a configuration with one A10 GPU, 18 CPU cores and 220GB\nof RAM which was able to run the game and rollout the trained policy close to the desired 10Hz for\nall models.\nMinecraft\nThe training hardware is similar to Minecraft Dungeons, with A6000s used for em-\nbedding\/training with pretrained models, and 32GB V100s used to train the end-to-end models.\nTraining pretrained models took considerably less time, with most models training within hours on\na single A6000 GPU.\nMinecraft evaluation was performed on remote Linux machines with A6000s, as MineRL is able to\nrun on headless machines with virtual X buffers (xvfb). Each GPU had maximum of three rollouts\nhappening concurrently, with each rollout running at 3-9 frames per second, depending on the model\nsize.\nCounter-Strike:\nGlobal Offensive\nTraining was performed on the same hardware as with\nMinecraft experiments. For evaluation, we ran CS:GO on a local Windows machine with an Nvidia\nTitan X, as per instructions in the original CS:GO paper Pearce & Zhu (2022). We ran the game at\nhalf speed (and adjusted action rate accordingly) to allow model to predict actions in time.\n27\n","pdf_path":"tools\/arxiv_tools\/asset\/pdf\/\/Visual Encoders for Data-Efficient Imitation Learning in Modern Video Games.pdf","query_prompt":"### 任务\n你是一个人工智能领域的专家，你能够快速阅读arxiv上的各种AI前沿论文和相关博客，进而完美地回答学生的问题。\n现在请你阅读以下论文及博客，并回答学生的问题。\n\n### 论文信息\n###  1. 论文标题\n```\nVisual Encoders for Data-Efficient Imitation Learning in Modern Video Games\n```\n#### 2. 论文摘要\n```\nVideo games have served as useful benchmarks for the decision making\ncommunity, but going beyond Atari games towards training agents in modern games\nhas been prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of the research\ncommunity.

However,\nvideo games do not only serve as benchmarks but also represent a vast entertainment industry where\nAI agents may eventually have applications in games development, including game testing or game\ndesign (Jacob et al., 2020; Gillberg et al., 2023).\nIn the past, video game research often necessitated close integration with the games themselves to\nobtain game-specific information and establish a scalable interface for training agents.

To\neliminate integration costs during training, we use behavior cloning to train agents entirely offline,\nutilising previously collected human gameplay data. Although prior research has explored encoding\nimages into lower-dimensional representations for behavior cloning, these studies primarily targeted\nrobotics applications (Nair et al., 2022), where images often resemble real-world scenes. Inspired\nby the challenges and potential applications in video games, we investigate the following research\nquestion: How can images be encoded for data-efficient imitation learning in modern video games?\nTowards our guiding research question, we compare both end-to-end trained visual encoders and\npre-trained visual encoders in three modern video games: Minecraft, Minecraft Dungeons and\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). We examine 12 distinct end-to-end trained visual en-\ncoders, varying in network architecture (Residual Networks (ResNets) (He et al., 2016a;b) or Vision\nTransformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Steiner et al., 2022)), image input size, and the ap-\nplication of image augmentations. In contrast, pre-trained visual encoders are often trained on large\ndatasets containing diverse real-world images, potentially providing useful and generalisable rep-\nresentations without additional training. However, it remains uncertain how well these pre-trained\nencoders perform in video games, which often exhibit substantial differences from real-world im-\nages. We identify four primary categories of training paradigms among pre-trained visual encoders\nand train agents using the representations from a total of 10 different pre-trained encoders spanning\nall these categories: (1) self-supervised trained encoders (e.g. DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2023)), (2)\nlanguage-contrastive trained encoders (e.g. OpenAI CLIP (Radford et al., 2021)), (3) supervised\ntrained encoders (e.g. Imagenet classification trained FocalNet (Yang et al., 2022)), and (4) recon-\nstruction trained encoders (e.g. the encoder of a variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling,\n2013)). Finally, inspired by the cost associated with collecting human gameplay data and the hy-\npothesis that pre-trained encoders could be advantageous in the absence of extensive training data,\nwe investigate the performance of these visual encoders across varying amounts of training data.\nOur results show that even though visual encoders trained end-to-end in complex video games can be\neffective with relatively small 128×128 images and limited amounts of high-quality data, substantial\nimprovements can be achieved by employing pre-trained encoders, especially DINOv2.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nLearning Agents in Video Games. Video games have often served as benchmarks for decision-\nmaking agents, leading to impressive performance in modern video games where a programmatic in-\nterface (Vinyals et al., 2019; Berner et al., 2019) or large quantities of expert demonstrations (Baker\net al., 2022; Fan et al., 2022; Reed et al., 2022) are available for training. Recent work directly\nleverages or fine-tunes pre-trained foundation models to collect training data (Cai et al., 2023a) or\nguide action selection (Wang et al., 2023; Lifshitz et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b), but games without\nsuch close integration, extensive datasets or pre-trained models have seen comparably little research\nattention. Pearce & Zhu (2022) used imitation learning to train agents to play CS:GO with a com-\nbination of online scraped gameplay and expert demonstrations. Similarly, Kanervisto et al. (2020)\nbenchmarked imitation learning agents across a diverse set of video games, including six modern\ngames without programmatic interfaces. They emulated keyboard and mouse inputs to take actions\nin these games, akin to our approach. However, their study was limited to relatively simple visual\nencoders and agents did not leverage temporal history used in most recent decision-making agents.\nVisual Encoders for Imitation Learning. Prior research has compared pre-trained visual encoders\nto those trained end-to-end using imitation learning for robotic applications (Nair et al., 2022; Yuan\net al., 2022). These studies generally found that pre-trained encoders exhibit better generality and\nperformance than those trained on smaller, task-specific data sets. However, given the real-world\nnature of robotics and the availability of datasets, it remains uncertain how these findings translate\nto the realm of video games. Our study seeks to bridge this gap.\nVisual Encoders for Video Games. In the context of video games, pre-trained visual models have\nbeen employed to extract visual representations that differentiate between genres and styles (Trivedi\net al., 2023), indicating their ability to detect relevant features in games. However, domain-specific\nmodels trained using self-supervised representation learning techniques can yield higher-quality rep-\nresentations than certain pre-trained visual encoders (Trivedi et al., 2022). Our study expands upon\n2\nPreprint\nVisual\nEncoder\nPolicy\nActions\nMLP\n512\nLSTM 512\nLSTM\nMLP\n512\nActions\nPolicy\nFigure 2: Architecture illustration: Core network architecture used throughout all the experiments.\nprevious experiments by concentrating on modern video games and examining a broad spectrum of\nrecent pre-trained and end-to-end trained visual encoder architectures.\n3\nIMITATION LEARNING FOR VIDEO GAMES FROM PIXELS\n3.1\nBEHAVIOUR CLONING\nBehavior cloning (BC) is an imitation learning approach that trains agents through supervised learn-\ning using a dataset of provided demonstrations, denoted as D = (o1, a1), . . . , (oN, aN), where N\nrepresents the total number of samples in the dataset. Each demonstration comprises tuples (o, a),\nwhich correspond to the image observation o and the human player’s chosen action a at a specific\npoint during training. Using this data, a policy π(a | o; θ) is trained to mimic the distribution of\nactions found in D, based on the current image observed, by minimising the loss\nL(θ) = E(o,a)∼D,ˆa∼π(·|o;θ) [l(a, ˆa)]\n(1)\nwhere l measures the discrepancy between the ”true” action a and the policy’s sampled action ˆa. For\ncontinuous and discrete actions, we use the mean-squared error and cross-entropy loss, respectively.\n3.2\nIMAGE PROCESSING\nReceived images, sampled from the dataset during training or directly from the game during eval-\nuation, are first resized to the required image size of the respective visual encoder (see Table 1)1.\nIf image augmentation is used for an encoder, images are augmented after resizing using the same\naugmentations applied by Baker et al. (2022). Finally, image colour values are normalised.\n3.3\nARCHITECTURE\nThe architecture of all trained agents is illustrated in Figure 2, and Table 1 lists all visual encoders\nconsidered in our experiments. The processed image ot is fed through the visual encoder to obtain\nan embedding zt. The policy receives this embedding and outputs actions at for the respective game.\nPolicy Network. For all experiments, the policy architecture remains identical. First, the received\nembedding zt is projected to 512 dimensions with a MLP with one hidden layer of dimension 512\nbefore being fed through a two-layered LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) with hidden di-\nmensions of 512. The LSTM processes the projected embedding and a hidden state ht−1 which\nrepresents the history of previously received embeddings during a sequence (obtained either as a\nsampled sequence during training or online evaluation). Following the two-layered LSTM, a MLP\nwith one hidden layer of 512 dimensions is used to project the 512-dimensional representation out-\nputted by the LSTM to as many dimensions as there are actions. At each intermediate layer, the\nReLU activation function is applied.\nEnd-to-End Visual Encoders. For visual encoders trained end-to-end with the BC loss, we con-\nsider three ResNet (He et al., 2016a;b) and three vision transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021;\nSteiner et al., 2022) architectures. The Impala (Espeholt et al., 2018) ResNet architecture is a com-\nmonly used visual encoder for decision making agents but designed for smaller image sizes than\n128 × 128 and, thus, outputs large embeddings. For comparison, we evaluate two alternative larger\n1For the resizing, we use linear interpolation for end-to-end encoders and bicubic interpolation for all pre-\ntrained encoders to be consistent with the processing pipeline used during training of the pre-trained encoders.\n3\nPreprint\nTable 1: Overview of all visual encoder architectures considered in this study including the type\nof training category, image sizes, parameter counts and the size of computed embeddings.

For ViTs, we evaluate the commonly used tiny model architecture proposed\nby Steiner et al. (2022) which outputs fairly small embeddings. For comparison, we also evaluate\ntwo alternative architectures with slightly larger models that output comparably larger embeddings.\nSee Appendix A.1 for full details on all end-to-end visual encoder architectures.\nPre-Trained Visual Encoders. We consider four paradigms of pre-trained visual encoders with rep-\nresentative models being evaluated in our experiments: OpenAI’s CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) as lan-\nguage contrastive pre-trained encoders, DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2023) as self-supervised pre-trained\nencoders with self-distillation objectives between a teacher and student network, FocalNet (Yang\net al., 2022) trained on ImageNet21K classification as supervised pre-trained encoders, and a varia-\ntional autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2013) from stable diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022)\nas reconstruction pre-trained encoder. These visual encoders have already been trained on large\namounts of real-world images. During all our experiments, we freeze these encoders and only use\nthem to obtain embeddings of images without any fine-tuning or further training. For details on\nthe models used, see Appendix A.2, and for details on the network architecture, training data, and\nfurther considerations of these encoders we refer to the original papers.\nTraining Configuration. For each network update, we sample 32 random sequences of 100 consec-\nutive image-action pairs within the dataset. Before each training step, the hidden state and cell state\nof the LSTMs in the policy are reset and the mean BC loss is computed across all sequences with the\nhidden state accumulating across the 100 samples within a sequence. The Adam optimiser (Kingma\n& Ba, 2014) is used with decoupled weight decay (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) of 0.01 and a learn-\ning rate of 3 · 10−4. To stabilise training, gradients are normalised at 1.0 and we use half precision\nfor all training. In Minecraft Dungeons, we train each model for 1 million gradient updates. In\nMinecraft and CS:GO, models are trained for 500,000 gradient updates.\n4\nVIDEO GAMES FOR EVALUATION\nWe train and evaluate BC models with all visual encoders in three different games, Minecraft Dun-\ngeons, Minecraft and CS:GO, illustrated in Figure 1. Below, we will outline details regarding the\ntraining data and action space for each game.\n4\nPreprint\n4.1\nMINECRAFT DUNGEONS\nMinecraft Dungeons is an action-adventure role-playing video game with isometric camera view\ncentered on the player. The player controls the movement and actions (including dodge roll, attack,\nuse health potion, use items) of a single character which is kept in the center of the video frame (as\nseen in Figure 1a). The player has to complete diverse levels by following and completing several\nobjectives. In our evaluation, we focus on the “Arch Haven” level of Minecraft Dungeons which\ncontains fighting against several types of enemies and navigation across visually diverse terrain.\nDataset. Before data collection, we pre-registered this study with our Institutional Review Board\n(IRB) who advised on the drafting of our participant instructions to ensure informed consent. After\ntheir approval, four players2 played the “Arch Haven” level, and game frames at 1280 × 720 resolu-\ntion, actions (joystick positions and button presses on a controller), and character position within the\nlevel were captured. The dataset includes a total of 139 recorded trajectories with more than eight\nhours of gameplay at 30Hz. Individual demonstrations vary between 160 and 380 seconds which\ncorresponds to 4,800 and 11,400 recorded actions, respectively. We use 80% of the data for training\nand reserve 20% for validation. Each player was instructed to complete the level using a fixed char-\nacter equipped with only the starting equipment of a sword and bow, and most players followed the\nimmediate path towards level completion.\nAction space. Agents have access to all effective controls in Minecraft Dungeons, including the x-\nand y-positions of both joysticks, the right trigger position (for shooting the bow), and ten buttons.\nThe most frequently used buttons during recordings control sword attacks, bow shooting, healing\npotions, and forward dodging.\nOnline evaluation. To evaluate the quality of trained BC policies, we rollout the policy in the game\nwith actions being queried at 10Hz (see Appendix D for details). These actions are then taken in\nthe game using Xbox controller emulation software. Each rollout spawns the agent in the beginning\nof the “Arch Haven” level and queries actions until five minutes passed (3,000 actions) or the agent\ndies four times resulting in the level being failed. We run 20 rollouts per trained agent and report the\nprogression throughout the level (Appendix C).\n4.2\nMINECRAFT\nMinecraft is a game that lets players create and explore a world made of breakable cubes. Players\ncan gather resources, craft items and fight enemies in this open-world sandbox game. Minecraft is\nalso a useful platform for AI research, where different learning algorithms can be tested and com-\npared (Johnson et al., 2016). We use the MineRL (Guss et al., 2019; Baker et al., 2022) environment,\nwhich connects Minecraft with Python and allows us to control the agents and the environment. We\nuse MineRL version 1.0.2, which has been used for large-scale imitation learning experiments be-\nfore (Baker et al., 2022), and which offers simpler mouse and keyboard input than previous MineRL\nversions (Guss et al., 2019).\nTask and online evaluation. To evaluate our BC models, we use the “Treechop” task; after spawn-\ning to a new, randomly generated world, the player has to chop a single log of a tree within 1 minute.\nThis is the first step to craft many of the items in Minecraft, and has been previously used to bench-\nmark reinforcement learning algorithms (Guss et al., 2019). See Figure 1b for a screenshot of the\nstarting state. The agent observes the shown image pixels in first-person perspective, can move the\nplayer around and attack to chop trees. For reporting the performance of trained models, we rollout\neach model for 100 episodes with the same world seeds, and record the number of trees the player\nchopped. If the player chopped at least one tree within the first minute, the episode is counted as a\nsuccess, otherwise it is counted as a failure (the timeout is set to 1 minute).\nDataset. We use the Minecraft dataset released with the OpenAI VPT model (Baker et al., 2022)\nto select demonstrations of tree chopping. We choose the 6.13 version of the dataset and filter it to\n40 minutes of human demonstrations that start from a fresh world and chop a tree within 1 minute.\nWe also remove any erroneous files that remain after the filtering. The demonstrations include the\nimage pixels seen by the human player at 640 × 360 resolution and the keyboard and mouse state at\nthe same time, recorded at 20Hz. We also run the models at 20Hz.\n2120 recordings were collected by one player with the remaining 19 recordings being roughly evenly split\nacross the other three players.\n5\nPreprint\nbeach\ngate\npath\nstairs\nbooks\ncave\nProgression zone\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nProgression percentage\nImpala ResNet\nResNet 128\nResNet 256\nNo Augmentation\n(a) End-to-end ResNets\nbeach\ngate\npath\nstairs\nbooks\ncave\nProgression zone\nViT Tiny\nViT 128\nViT 256\nNo Augmentation\n(b) End-to-end ViTs\nbeach\ngate\npath\nstairs\nbooks\ncave\nProgression zone\nCLIP RN50\nDINO ViT-S\/14\nFocal Large\nSD VAE\nLarger\nLargest\n(c) Pre-trained encoders\nFigure 3: Online evaluation progression for BC agents in Minecraft Dungeons with (a) end-to-\nend ResNets, (b) end-to-end ViTs, and (c) pre-trained visual encoders. We visualise the mean and\nstandard deviation, computed over three training seeds, of the percentage of rollouts progressing\nthrough each of the objective zones within the “Arch Haven” level. Results for the ViT Tiny model\nare only aggregated over two seeds, as one seed resulted in an invalid checkpoint.\n4.3\nCOUNTER-STRIKE: GLOBAL OFFENSIVE\nCS:GO is a first-person shooter game designed for competitive, five versus five games. The core\nskill of the game is accurate aiming and handling the weapon recoil\/sway as the weapon is fired.\nPrevious work has used CS:GO as a benchmark to train and test behavioural cloning models (Pearce\net al., 2023), with best models able to outperform easier bots (Pearce & Zhu, 2022). We incorporate\nexperiments using CS:GO, as it offers visuals more similar to the real-world images that most pre-\ntrained visual encoders were trained on, in contrast to our primary evaluation in Minecraft Dungeons\nand Minecraft (see Figure 1c).\nFollowing Pearce et al. (2023), we use the “Clean aim train” dataset and setup. The controlled\nplayer is placed in the middle of an arena, and random enemies are spawned around them who try\nto reach the player. The player can not move; they can only aim to different directions (Figure 1c).\nThe dataset contains 45 minutes of expert-human gameplay from one player, recorded at 16Hz. To\nevaluate models, we run each model for three rollouts of five minutes each, and report the average\nand standard deviation of the kills-per-minute.\n5\nEVALUATION\nIn our evaluation, we focus on the guiding question of how to encode images for data-efficient im-\nitation learning in modern video games. The evaluation is structured in four experiments studying\n(1) which end-to-end visual encoder is most effective, (2) which pre-trained encoder is most effec-\ntive, (3) how do the best end-to-end and pre-trained visual encoders compare under varying amounts\nof training data, and (4) how do the best visual encoders compare in a video game with visuals\nmore akin to the real-world. For each experiment, we train each model with three different seeds\nand report aggregated training and online evaluation metrics. Lastly, we visually inspect the visual\nencoders with respect to the information they attend to during action selection. An outline of the\ncomputational resources used for training and evaluation can be found in Appendix G.\n5.1\nHOW TO CHOOSE END-TO-END VISUAL ENCODERS?\nTo identify which end-to-end visual encoder is the most effective, we train all six end-to-end visual\nencoder architectures (listed in Table 1) with and without image augmentations using the BC loss.\nFigures 3a and 3b visualise the online evaluation performance for all models with end-to-end ResNet\nand ViT visual encoders, respectively, in Minecraft Dungeons. We observe that image augmentation\nconsistently improves online performance, leading to models that more robustly progress further.\nResNet image encoders slightly outperform ViT models, but by no significant margins. Lastly,\nno notable difference can be observed for end-to-end encoders trained on images of 128 × 128 or\n6\nPreprint\nTable 2: Minecraft online evaluation of agent success rate chopping a single tree with end-to-end\ntrained (left) and pre-trained (right) visual encoders.

These results suggest that comparably small images of 128×128 are sufficient\neven for complex video games like Minecraft Dungeons. In Minecraft (Table 2, left half), we also\nobserve that the input image size has no significant effect on the results. However, ViT 256 and\nViT Tiny outperform most ResNets by statistically significant margins (double-tailed Welch’s test,\np < 0.05) without image augmentations.\nThese results suggest two main findings: (1) Small images of 128 × 128 can be sufficient to train\nagents in complex modern video games, and (2) image augmentation has the potential to signifi-\ncantly improve performance but is game-specific.\n5.2\nHOW TO CHOOSE PRE-TRAINED VISUAL ENCODERS?\nTo identify most suitable pre-trained visual encoders for video games, we compare BC agents trained\nwith the representations of 10 pre-trained encoders. These encoders are frozen during BC training.\nIn Minecraft Dungeons (Figure 3c) and MineCraft (Table 2, right half), we find that BC models\nwith DINOv2 visual encoders generally outperform other models. In Minecraft Dungeons, the BC\nmodels trained with DINOv2 ViT-B\/14 pre-trained encoder outperforms all other models, including\nany end-to-end trained visual encoder. The stable diffusion encoder still outperforms FocalNet and\nCLIP visual encoders, but performs notably worse than all DINOv2 models. In Minecraft, the\nlargest DINOv2 ViT-L\/14, significantly (p < 0.05) outperforms all but the noisiest models (Tiny\nViT, ViT 128 +Aug, Stable Diffusion and CLIP ResNet 50). While smaller DINOv2 models appear\nbetter than FocalNet or CLIP, their results are not significantly different from ViT-B\/14 and ViT-S\/14\nDINOv2 models. Stable diffusion VAE works similarly to smaller DINOv2 models in Minecraft.\nLastly, we observe that there is no clear correlation between the model size of pre-trained encoders\nand online performance. While larger DINOv2 models perform best in Minecraft, the same trend\ndoes not hold for CLIP and FocalNet where encoders with fewer parameters perform better.\n5.3\nHOW MUCH DATA DO YOU NEED?\nA significant advantage of utilising pre-trained visual encoders is their independence from additional\ntraining, potentially resulting in more reliable performance with limited data. In contrast, visual\nencoders specifically trained for a particular task may be less generalisable but have the potential to\noutperform general-purpose pre-trained encoders. To test this hypothesis, we examine how the top-\nperforming end-to-end and pre-trained visual encoders (based on online evaluation performance)\ncompare with varying amounts of data.\nIn Minecraft Dungeons, we select the DINOv2 ViT-S\/14, ViT-B\/14 models, as well as the ResNet\nand ViT architectures on 128 × 128 images and image augmentation as the best-performing pre-\n7\nPreprint\nbeach\ngate\npath\nstairs\nbooks\ncave\nProgression zone\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nProgression percentage\nResNet 128 +Aug\nViT 128 +Aug\nDINO ViT-S\/14\nDINO ViT-B\/14\n50% Data\n25% Data\nFigure 4: Online evaluation progression for\nthe best-performing BC agents in Minecraft\nDungeons with the full dataset (solid line)\nand subparts of the dataset.\nTable 3: Online evaluation performance for the\nbest-performing BC agents in Minecraft with the\nfull dataset and 10% of the dataset.\nModel name\nSuccess rate (%)\nViT 256 (Full)\n24.33± 0.94\nViT 256 (10%)\n10.33± 1.70\nViT Tiny (Full)\n23.33± 4.19\nViT Tiny (10%)\n16.50± 1.50\nDINOv2 ViT-L\/14 (Full)\n32.00± 1.63\nDINOv2 ViT-L\/14 (10%)\n15.00± 2.16\nDINOv2 ViT-B\/14 (Full)\n25.33± 2.05\nDINOv2 ViT-B\/14 (10%)\n17.00± 1.41\ntrained and end-to-end trained encoders, respectively. We generate two reduced datasets with 50%\n(∼4 hours) and 25% (∼2 hours) of the training data by sampling trajectories uniformly at ran-\ndom. Each of the selected models is then trained on the 50% and 25% training datasets for 500 and\n250 thousand gradient updates, respectively. Figure 4 shows the online evaluation performance of\nall models. As expected, we can see that the performance of all models gradually deteriorates as\nthe training data is reduced. For pre-trained models, the larger DINOv2 ViT-B\/14 outperforms the\nsmaller ViT-S\/14 when dealing with smaller datasets. Regarding end-to-end trained models, the ViT\nmodel’s performance declines more rapidly with smaller data quantities compared to the ResNet.\nHowever, contrary to expectations, both end-to-end trained visual encoders yield performance com-\nparable to pre-trained models in lower data regimes.\nIn Minecraft, we also experimented with a low-data regime by using only 10% (∼3.5 minutes, 14\ndemonstrations, 4269 steps of data) of gameplay data. The results for the two best end-to-end and\npre-trained models are shown in Table 3. The success rate drops by half for all models, but it is still\nbetter than some models in the full experiments. This is surprising considering the small amount\nof data. Similar to Minecraft Dungeons, there is no significant difference between pre-trained and\nend-to-end visual encoders, suggesting that either of them could work well with less than 5 minutes\nof high-quality demonstration data. However, contrary to Minecraft Dungeons, there is no clear\ndifference between both DINOv2 encoders in the lower data regime, suggesting that there is no\nclear correlation between model size and online performance in the very low data regime.\n5.4\nGRAD-CAM INSPECTION OF VISUAL ENCODERS\nTo understand what information is captured by visual encoders at various times in the games, we\nuse gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) (Selvaraju et al., 2017) to inspect each\ntrained visual encoder. We visualise the Grad-CAM activations of visual encoders for images in\nMinecraft Dungeons and Minecraft with action logits of trained BC policies serving as the targets,\nthese can be interpreted as which parts of the image are most relevant for the visual encoder during\naction selection. For more details on the Grad-CAM visualisations, plots for more game screenshots\nin both games and all visual encoders, see Appendix F.\nFigure 5 shows the Grad-CAM activations for the best-performing visual encoders in both Minecraft\nDungeons and Minecraft. In Minecraft Dungeons, many visual encoders tend to focus on the parts\nof the image containing the player character and enemy units. We hypothesise that other activations\nmight correspond to way points the models focus on to navigate through the level. In Minecraft,\nmost visual encoders tend to focus on parts indicative of nearby terrain, wood, and the progress of\nchopping a tree, aligning with the objective of the task.\n8\nPreprint\n(a) Original\n(b) RN 128 +Aug\n(c) ViT 128 +Aug\n(d) DINOv2 ViT-S\n(e) DINOv2 ViT-B\n(f) Original\n(g) ViT 256\n(h) ViT Tiny\n(i) DINOv2 ViT-L\n(j) DINOv2 ViT-B\nFigure 5: Grad-CAM visualisation of the activation of the best-performing visual encoders for\nMinecraft Dungeons (top) and Minecraft (bottom) with action logits of a BC policy serving as tar-\ngets.

Mean and one standard deviation are provided.\nResNet 128 +Aug\nViT 128 +Aug\nDINOv2 ViT-S\/14\n7.97 ± 0.57\n4.42 ± 0.59\n2.18 ± 1.12\nResults in Table 4 indicate end-to-end trained models perform significantly better (p < 0.05) than\nDINOv2, and ResNet outperforms ViT (also p < 0.05). Initially, we hypothesised that the image\nprocessing in CS:GO3 might be the cause for the poor online performance of DINOv2. However,\nfurther investigation with four pre-trained visual encoders in Minecraft (detailed in Appendix E)\nindicates that pre-trained visual encoders are not as sensitive to the image processing as hypothe-\nsised from the performance of DINOv2 ViT-S\/14 in CS:GO. Even with similar image processing as\napplied in CS:GO, agents trained with pre-trained visual encoders were able to exhibit performance\ncomparable to our original findings in Minecraft. We leave further investigation into the efficacy of\npre-trained visual encoders in CS:GO and the observed failure of DINOv2 for future work.\n6\nCONCLUSION\nIn this study, we systematically evaluated the effectiveness of imitation learning in modern video\ngames by comparing the conventional end-to-end training of task-specific visual encoders with the\nuse of publicly available pre-trained encoders. Our findings revealed that training visual encoders\nend-to-end on relatively small images can yield strong performance when using high-quality, repre-\nsentative data for the evaluation task, even in low-data regimes of few hours or minutes. DINOv2,\ntrained with self-supervised objectives on diverse data, consistently outperformed other pre-trained\nvisual encoders, indicating its generality and suitability for video games. Interestingly, agents us-\ning these pre-trained visual encoders demonstrated performance comparable (or superior) to those\n3The CS:GO dataset contains images at a resolution of 280×150 but images have to be resized to 224×224\nfor DINOv2. This up-scaling of the image height after initial down-scaling during the dataset collection differs\nfrom the image processing applied during the pre-training of DINOv2.\n9\nPreprint\nemploying game-specific visual encoders across different data volumes. However, careful attention\nmust be given to image resizing and processing as seen in CS:GO. Overall, our results suggest that\nthe use of effective pre-trained visual encoders, such as DINOv2, should be seriously considered in\nthe context of modern video games.\nIn order to maintain focus and feasibility in our study, we concentrated on a specific set of visual\nencoders, enabling a range of comparisons between different architectures and pre-trained model\nparadigms. Nevertheless, our study could be complemented by exploring additional comparison\npoints, such as diverse supervised-trained pre-trained encoder architectures and additional scenarios\nwithin the examined or other video games. Although our study focused on settings with available\ntraining data for the evaluation task, future work could explore the potential benefits of pre-trained\nvisual encoders when agents need to generalise across diverse levels or maps with variable visuals.\nREFERENCES\nBowen Baker, Ilge Akkaya, Peter Zhokov, Joost Huizinga, Jie Tang, Adrien Ecoffet, Brandon\nHoughton, Raul Sampedro, and Jeff Clune.

(2018) consisting of a 3×3 convolution with stride 1,\nmax pooling with 3×3 kernels and stride 2 followed by two residual blocks of two 3×3 convolutions\nwith stride 1. This joint block is repeated three times with 16, 32, and 32 channels, respectively.\nCustom ResNet\nThe architecture for our custom ResNet models is modelled after Liu et al. (2022)\nand illustrated in detail in Figure 6.\nConv2d \n \n,\nstride=4, padding=3\nConv2d \n \n,\nstride=1, padding=3\nGroupNorm\nConv2d \n \n,\nstride=1, padding=0\nGeLU\nConv2d \n \n,\nstride=1, padding=0\nGroupNorm\nConv2d \n \n,\nstride=2, padding=1\nRepeat for \nGeLU\nLayerNorm\nFigure 6: Illustration of the architecture of our custom ResNet visual encoders for 128 × 128 and\n256 × 256 images.\nViT\nOur ViT architectures are all based on the reference implementation at https:\/\/github.\ncom\/lucidrains\/vit-pytorch\/blob\/main\/vit_pytorch\/vit.py. For all models,\nwe use no dropout, and the following configurations are used across the considered ViT visual\nencoders:\nModel name\nPatch size\nNum layers\nWidth\nMLP dim\nNum heads\nViT Tiny\n16\n12\n192\n768\n3\nCustom ViT\n16\n4\n512\n512\n12\nTable 5: Configurations of end-to-end ViT models.\nThe ViT Tiny architecture follows the suggested architecture of Steiner et al. (2022). In contrast,\nboth custom ViT for 128 × 128 and 256 × 256 have notably fewer layers, wider dimensions of the\nattention layers and no increase of dimensions in the MLP projections. In our experiments, we found\nthat such an architecture resulted in better online evaluation performance in several video games.\nImage augmentations\nIf image augmentations are applied during training, we randomly augment\nimages after the down-scaling process. We implement all augmentations with the torchvision\nlibrary and randomly sample augmentations during training. We apply the following augmentations\nas described by Baker et al. (2022):\n• Change colour hue by a random factor between -0.2 and 0.2\n• Change colour saturation with a random factor between 0.8 and 1.2\n• Change brightness with a random factor between 0.8 and 1.2\n• Change colour contrast with a random factor between 0.8 and 1.2\n• Randomly rotate the image between -2 and 2 degrees\n• Scale the image with a random factor between 0.98 and 1.02 in each dimension\n• Apply a random shear to the image between -2 and 2 degrees\n• Randomly translate the image between -2 and 2 pixels in both the x- and y-direction\n13\nPreprint\nA.2\nPRE-TRAINED VISUAL ENCODERS\nIn this section, we will detail the sources for all pre-trained visual encoders considered in our eval-\nuation.\nOpenAI CLIP\nFor the visual encoders of OpenAI’s CLIP models (Radford et al., 2021), we use\nthe official interface available at https:\/\/github.com\/openai\/CLIP. We use the following\nmodels from this repository: ”RN50” (ResNet 50), ”ViT-B\/16”, and ”ViT-L\/14”. In preliminary\nexperiments, we found the available larger ResNet models to provide no significant improvements\nin online evaluation performance and the ViT model with a larger patch size of 32 to perform worse\nthan the chosen ViT models with patch sizes of 16 and 14.\nDINOv2\nFor the DINOv2 pre-trained visual encoders (Oquab et al., 2023), we use the official in-\nterface available at https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/dinov2. Due to the com-\nputational cost, we do not evaluate the non-distilled ViT-G\/14 checkpoint with 1.1 billion parame-\nters.\nFocalNet\nFor the FocalNet pre-trained visual encoders (Yang et al., 2022), we used the Hugging\nFace timm library (https:\/\/huggingface.co\/docs\/timm\/index) to load the pre-trained\nmodels for its ease of use. We use the FocalNet models pre-trained on ImageNet-22K classification\nwith 4 focal layers: ”focalnet large fl4”, ”focalnet xlarge fl4”, and ”focalnet huge fl4”.\nStable Diffusion\nFor the pre-trained stable diffusion 2.1 VAE encoder, we use the Hugging\nFace checkpoint of the model available at https:\/\/huggingface.co\/stabilityai\/\nsdxl-vae. This model can be accessed with the diffusers library. In contrast to other encoders,\nthe VAE outputs a Gaussian distribution of embeddings rather than an individual embedding for a\ngiven image. We use the mode of the distribution of a given image as its embedding since (1) we\nwant to keep the embeddings of the frozen encoder for a given image deterministic, and (2) we find\nthe standard deviation to be neglectable for most inputs.\nB\nADDITIONAL EVALUATION DATA\nIn this section, we provide additional insight into our evaluation.\nMinecraft Dungeons\nFigure 7a (top) shows the training loss for all models with end-to-end visual\nencoders in Minecraft Dungeons. From the training loss, we can see that image augmentations\ngenerally increase the training loss despite improving online performance as seen in Figures 3a\nand 3b. We also note that training for the custom ResNet with 256 × 256 images and the Impala\nResNet exhibit high dispersion across three seeds, leading to large shading and stagnation of the\nloss early in training. We hypothesise that this occurs for the Impala ResNet due to the overly large\nembeddings which complicate learning a policy with BC.\nFor BC models with pre-trained visual encoders, the training loss shown in Figure 7b appears com-\nparably similar for most models. Only the reconstruction-based stable diffusion encoder and the\nCLIP ResNet50 models stand out since they outperform and underperform all other models, respec-\ntively.\nComparing the training loss of BC models trained with end-to-end and pre-trained visual encoders\nfurther shows that end-to-end encoders trained without image augmentation are capable of reaching\nlower losses. We hypothesise that this occurs since the end-to-end trained encoders are specialised\nto perform well on the exact training data the loss is computed over.\nMinecraft\nIn contrast, the training loss in Minecraft (Figure 7 bottom) quickly stagnates and con-\nverges to similarly low values for all end-to-end and pre-trained encoders.\nCS:GO\nIn CS:GO, the training loss improves all throughout training for all three trained models\nwith the models trained with DINOv2 ViT-S\/14 pre-trained encoders achieving the lowest training\nloss. In contrast, both the end-to-end trained ResNet and ViT encoders trained with 128 × 128\n14\nPreprint\n0\n200000\n400000\n600000\n800000\nSteps\n10−4\n10−3\n10−2\n10−1\nTraining loss\nImpala ResNet\nResNet 128\nResNet 256\nViT Tiny\nViT 128\nViT 256\nNo Augmentation\n0\n100000\n200000\n300000\n400000\nSteps\n10−1\n2 × 10−2\n3 × 10−2\n4 × 10−2\n6 × 10−2\nTraining loss\nImpala ResNet\nResNet 128\nResNet 256\nViT Tiny\nViT 128\nViT 256\nNo Augmentation\n(a) End-to-end training loss\n0\n200000\n400000\n600000\n800000\nSteps\n10−2\n10−1\nTraining loss\nCLIP RN50\nDINO ViT-S\/14\nFocal Large\nSD VAE\nLarger\nLargest\n0\n100000\n200000\n300000\n400000\nSteps\n2 × 10−2\n3 × 10−2\n4 × 10−2\n6 × 10−2\nTraining loss\nCLIP RN50\nDINO ViT-S\/14\nFocal Large\nSD VAE\nLarger\nLargest\n(b) Pre-trained training loss\nFigure 7: Training loss in log-scale for BC agents in Minecraft Dungeons (top) and Minecraft (bot-\ntom) with (a) end-to-end trained and (b) pre-trained visual encoders.

We visualise the mean and\nstandard deviation across three seeds.\nimages and image augmentation have higher training loss. We highlight that these end-to-end trained\nvisual encoders are trained with image augmentations whereas the models with DINOv2 pre-trained\nencoders are not. Such image augmentations have been seen to consistently increase the training loss\nin Minecraft Dungeons and might be the main reason for the higher training loss of the end-to-end\ntrained models.\nC\nMINECRAFT DUNGEONS ARCH HAVEN LEVEL\nTo measure progress for the online evaluation in Minecraft Dungeons, we define boundaries of zones\nwhich determine the progression throughout the ”Arch Haven” level we evaluate in. These zones\nand a heatmap showing the visited locations of the human demonstrations used for training are\nvisualised in Figure 9. The heatmap also shows the path followed by most demonstrations towards\ncompletion of the level.\nD\nMINECRAFT DUNGEONS ACTION FREQUENCY IN ONLINE EVALUATION\nThe visual encoders used in our evaluation have vastly different model sizes (see Table 1) and,\nthus, notably different computational cost at inference time. This is particularly challenging during\nonline evaluation in Minecraft Dungeons, since there exists no programmatic interface to pause or\n15\nPreprint\n0\n100000\n200000\n300000\n400000\nSteps\n10−4\n10−3\n10−2\n10−1\nTraining loss\nResNet 128 +Aug\nViT 128 +Aug\nDINO ViT-S\/14\nFigure 8: Training loss in log-scale for BC agents in CS:GO with (a) end-to-end trained and (b)\npre-trained visual encoders.\nbeach\ngate\npath\nstairs\nbooks\n(a) Progression zones\n(b) Human dataset heatmap\nFigure 9: (a) A visualisation of the boundaries of each progression zone in the ”Arch Haven” level\nin Minecraft Dungeons used for online evaluations.

We attempt to take actions during evaluation at\n10Hz to match the action selection frequency of the (processed) training data, in particular due to the\nrecurrent architecture of our policy. However, we are unable to perfectly match this frequency for all\nvisual encoders on the hardware used to conduct the evaluation (see Appendix G for specifications\non the hardware used during training and online evaluation) despite using a more powerful GPU for\npre-trained visual encoders due to their comparably large size.\nTable 6 lists the average action frequencies of all models during online evaluation in Minecraft\nDungeons across all runs conducted as part of our evaluation. We note that most end-to-end trained\nvisual encoders enable fast inference achieving close to 10 Hz action frequency. The ViT Tiny model\nis the slowest model, likely due to its deeper 12 layers in comparison to the other end-to-end trained\nViT models with 4 layers as shown in Table 5, but we are still able to take actions at more than\n8.5Hz. For pre-trained visual encoders, we see comparably fast action frequencies for all CLIP and\nmost DINOv2 models as. The largest DINOv2 and stable diffusion VAE have notably slower action\nfrequencies, but the FocalNet models induced the highest inference cost. However, we highlight that\nwe did not observe behaviour during online evaluation which would suggest that these models were\nsignificantly inhibited due to this discrepancy.\n16\nPreprint\nTable 6: Average action frequencies during online evaluation in Minecraft Dungeons across 60 runs\nper model (20 for each seed).\nModel name\nAction freq.

We hypothesised that the cause of this poor performance in CS:GO is\nthe image resizing. The CS:GO dataset includes images cropped and down-scaled to a resolution of\n280×150 whereas DINOv2 pre-trained visual encoders (and most other pre-trained visual encoders)\nexpect image sizes of 224 × 224. Therefore, images are down-scaled from a higher resolution to\n280 × 150 during data collection and then up-scaled again to 224 × 224. We hypothesise that\nthis resizing causes discrepancies in the resulting images compared to the expected processing of\nresizing images from a higher resolution directly to 224 × 224.\nTo verify this hypothesis, we conduct experiments in Minecraft instead of CS:GO since the dataset\nin CS:GO is only available with images of 280 × 150. In our original evaluation in Minecraft, we\ndown-scaled images from a higher resolution of 640 × 360 to the respective resolution required by\neach visual encoder during training. To mimic the situation in CS:GO and separate the confound-\ning factors of down-scaling followed by up-scaling and squared and non-squared aspect ratios, we\nconsider two alternative image processing:\n1. CS:GO-like processing: We down-scale images to width 280 (keeping aspect ratio), crop\nto 280 × 150 from the middle, and re-size from this resolution to the resolution required by\nthe respective visual encoder.\n2. Squared aspect ratio: We down-scale images from the dataset to 150 × 150 and re-size\nfrom this resolution to the resolution required by the respective visual encoder.\nThe first processing allows us to study how different visual encoders are affected by processing\nas done in CS:GO, whereas the second processing allows us to study how the same experiment\nbehaves if squared aspect ratio is retained all throughout the process. We train and evaluate the\nbest performing pre-trained visual encoder of each family of models (following Table 2) with the\nrespective processing.\nTable 7 shows the online evaluation performance of models trained with four different pre-trained en-\ncoders either using the original image processing, CS:GO-like processing, or the described squared\nprocessing. As we can see, the large DINOv2 as well as the CLIP ResNet encoder perform com-\nparable for both the original processing and the CS:GO-like processing, but the performance of the\nFocalNet and Stable Diffusion encoders deteriorates slightly. Furthermore, all but the Stable Diffu-\nsion visual encoder perform best with the squared processing. Models trained with this processing,\nwhich ensures a squared aspect ratio for the initial down-scaling, perform best in terms of average\nperformance and exhibit notably lower deviation across two runs. Overall, these results indicate that\nthe processing applied in CS:GO is not necessarily detrimental to the performance of trained agents\n17\nPreprint\nTable 7: Minecraft online evaluation of agent success rate chopping a single tree with varying visual\nencoders and image processing.

Dungeons\nFor Minecraft Dungeons, end-to-end training runs for Impala ResNet, cus-\ntom ResNets (for 128 × 128 and 256 × 256 images) and custom ViT for 128 × 128 images without\nimage augmentation have been done on four 16GB V100s for each run. Training runs for the same\nmodels with image augmentation have been run on one A6000 GPU (with 48GB of VRAM) for\neach run. Training the ViT Tiny and ViT model for 256 × 256 images needed more VRAMs, so\nthese were trained on eight 16GB V100s for each run.\nFor training runs using pre-trained visual encoders, we computed the embeddings of all images in\nthe Minecraft Dungeons dataset prior to training for more efficient training using A6000 GPUs.\nAfter, we were able to train each model using pre-trained visual encoders with four 16GB V100s for\na single run.\nTo train models on half or a quarter of the training data for the third set of experiments, we used four\n16GB V100s for a single run of any configuration.\nSince the Minecraft Dungeons game is unable to run on Linux servers, we used Azure virtual ma-\nchines running Windows 10 for the online evaluation. For evaluation of end-to-end trained models,\nwe use a machine with two M60 GPUs, 24 CPU cores and 224GB of RAM. However, we noticed\nthat this configuration was insufficient to evaluate models with larger pre-trained visual encoders at\nthe desired 10Hz. Therefore, we used a configuration with one A10 GPU, 18 CPU cores and 220GB\nof RAM which was able to run the game and rollout the trained policy close to the desired 10Hz for\nall models.\nMinecraft\nThe training hardware is similar to Minecraft Dungeons, with A6000s used for em-\nbedding\/training with pretrained models, and 32GB V100s used to train the end-to-end models.\nTraining pretrained models took considerably less time, with most models training within hours on\na single A6000 GPU.\nMinecraft evaluation was performed on remote Linux machines with A6000s, as MineRL is able to\nrun on headless machines with virtual X buffers (xvfb). Each GPU had maximum of three rollouts\nhappening concurrently, with each rollout running at 3-9 frames per second, depending on the model\nsize.\nCounter-Strike:\nGlobal Offensive\nTraining was performed on the same hardware as with\nMinecraft experiments. For evaluation, we ran CS:GO on a local Windows machine with an Nvidia\nTitan X, as per instructions in the original CS:GO paper Pearce & Zhu (2022). We ran the game at\nhalf speed (and adjusted action rate accordingly) to allow model to predict actions in time.\n27\n\n```\n\n#### 5. 学生问题\n问题1：介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」\n问题2：这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？\n问题3：这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？\n\n\n请输出论文总结\n### 输出格式（输出语言用中文）\n```\n## 💡 解答问题1 (...复述学生问题1...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (...复述学生问题2...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (...复述学生问题3...)\n...\n```\n","llm_summary_res":"## 🌟 论文解读 | 视觉编码器在现代视频游戏中的高效模仿学习\n\n## 📌 背景痛点\/本文动机\n视频游戏一直是决策制定社区的有用基准，但将研究扩展到现代游戏对于大多数研究社区来说成本高昂。近年来，大型视觉模型的研究、开发和公开发布有可能在整个社区中分摊这些成本。然而，目前尚不清楚这些模型中的哪些模型已经学习了保留对顺序决策至关重要的信息的表示。为了使更广泛的社区参与现代游戏中的游戏代理研究，本文对Minecraft、Minecraft Dungeons和Counter-Strike: Global Offensive中的模仿学习进行了系统研究，并与典型的、特定任务的端到端训练方法进行了比较。\n\n## 🚀 核心方法\n💡 创新点1：本文比较了端到端训练的视觉编码器和公开可用的预训练编码器在模仿学习中的表现。端到端训练的编码器在相对较小的图像上训练，而预训练编码器则是在大型数据集上训练的，可能提供有用且通用的表示，而无需额外的训练。\n\n💡 创新点2：本文研究了不同数量的训练数据对视觉编码器性能的影响。结果表明，即使在使用少量高质量数据的情况下，预训练编码器也能表现出与特定任务编码器相当或更好的性能。\n\n## 📈 实验结果\n本文在三个现代视频游戏（Minecraft、Minecraft Dungeons和Counter-Strike: Global Offensive）中进行了实验，结果表明：\n\n1. 小图像（128×128）足以训练现代视频游戏中的代理，即使在使用少量高质量数据的情况下也能取得良好的性能。\n2. 预训练编码器，特别是DINOv2，在模仿学习中表现出色，并且在使用少量数据时仍然有效。\n3. 端到端训练的编码器在处理更真实世界的图像时表现更好，但在使用预训练编码器时需要仔细考虑图像大小和比例。\n\n## 💬 可借鉴之处\n本文的研究结果表明，预训练编码器在现代视频游戏的模仿学习中具有巨大的潜力。研究人员可以利用这些编码器来训练代理，从而降低成本并提高效率。此外，本文还强调了图像大小和比例对预训练编码器性能的重要性，这为未来的研究提供了有价值的见解。","llm_summary_res_status":200,"order":21,"query_answer":"## 💡 解答问题1 (介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」)\n\n这篇论文的benchmark是针对现代视频游戏中的模仿学习。具体来说，论文在三个现代视频游戏（Minecraft、Minecraft Dungeons和Counter-Strike: Global Offensive）中进行了实验，比较了端到端训练的视觉编码器和公开可用的预训练编码器在模仿学习中的表现。实验结果表明，预训练编码器，特别是DINOv2，在模仿学习中表现出色，并且在使用少量数据时仍然有效。此外，论文还发现，即使在使用少量高质量数据的情况下，小图像（128×128）也能训练出现代视频游戏中的代理，并取得良好的性能。\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？)\n\n论文中使用的设备条件如下：\n\n* **训练设备**： Azure compute，使用了Nvidia 16GB V100s、32GB V100s和A6000 GPUs。\n* **推理设备**： 对于Minecraft Dungeons，使用了Azure虚拟机运行Windows 10，配备了M60 GPUs、24 CPU cores和224GB of RAM。对于Minecraft，使用了远程Linux机器，配备了A6000 GPUs。对于Counter-Strike: Global Offensive，使用了本地Windows机器，配备了Nvidia Titan X。\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？)\n\n论文中并没有明确说明这个benchmark的环境是否具有高质量的结果奖励或过程奖励。但是，论文中提到，实验结果表明，即使在使用少量高质量数据的情况下，小图像（128×128）也能训练出现代视频游戏中的代理，并取得良好的性能。这表明，这个benchmark的环境可能具有一定的挑战性，能够支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩。","query_answer_status":200}

INTRODUCTION\nArtificial intelligence has become increasingly relevant in\nrecent years, with various applications in forecasting unseen\noutcomes within sports matches [23], [29]. Various deep learn-\ning approaches have been utilized to forecast the outcomes of\ncompetitive matches [38], [41]. One popular application per-\ntains to audience engagement in electronic sports (E-sports),\nwhere an estimated 71 million people watched competitive\ngaming in 2014 [39]. In 2015, DOTA 2 offered a 18 million\nUSD prize pool for its annual tournament, considered the\nlargest esport event in history [40]. The growing field of\nesports highlights the need for systematic in-game analysis\n[42]. These analytics focus on analyzing data from behavioral\npatterns to identify insightful trends [43]. Analytics also assists\ncompetitors to make an informed decisions and improving\nunderstanding of the gameplay tactics. Most importantly, it can\nsimplify in-game dynamics for the viewers, while promoting\naudience engagement through the use of data driven outcome\nprediction models.\nHowever, current forecasting of outcomes in sports is\nlimited to pre-match outcome predictions. While win-lose\nforecasts can directly tie in with the engagement of the\naudience, traditional sports does not have access to the real-\ntime information necessary to solve this problem. Typically,\n∗Kittimate Chulajata and Sean Wu contributed equally to this research and\nare co-first authors.\n† Open Source Github Repository\nthis gap in real-time analysis and prediction is compensated\nby live commentary, where experts draw upon their experience\nto forecast the most probable outcomes of the match. In the\ntraditional sports, similarly to finance, most predictions rely\nheavily on historical data, such as player statistics or past per-\nformances, to predict the outcome [29]. Thus, these methods\nlack the ability to take real-time events into consideration.\nEsports, on the other hand, is rich in information, opening\nup the opportunity to solve this real-time prediction problem.\nEsports offer the advantage of generating real-time data due\nto ease of access with its digital format. As a consequence,\nvarious applications involving video game datasets are emerg-\ning. [18], [30] While there have been multiple attempts to\nsolve this problem, [31] there have yet to exist a robust yet\nreal-time forecasting method for two player games.\nTime series forecasting based on Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) shows remarkable performance both inside [32] and\noutside Esports [1], [3], [9]. In particular, we focus on the\nreal-time forcasting problem using Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM) [1]. As proof of concept, we predict the live outcomes\nof a two-player arcade game, Super Street Fighter II Turbo.\nOur approach leverages the percentage of health bar loss for\neach player, allowing for predictions at different stages of the\nmatch in real time.\nThus, our LSTM-based approach involves real-time, mid-\nmatch data sets to predict outcomes at varying time-steps. We\nexperiment at different slices of the game round progression\n(25%, 75%, and 95%). We attempt to capture the sequential\ndynamics of two player games as a means of providing greater\nimmersive engagement for the E-sports viewers. By utilizing\nthe percent changes in the health bar of both players, which\nreflect the extent of damage inflicted, we suggest an approach\nthat is a step towards real-time game play analysis.\nConsequently, our contributions are as follows:\n• Robust prediction of gaming outcomes in two player\ngames mid-round (25%, 75%, & 95%) using Long Short\nTerm Memory Networks (LSTMs) as a means of enhanc-\ning audience engagement.\n• An open-source data set with code to further research\nin predictive time series analysis for two-player arcade\ngames.\narXiv:2402.15923v1  [cs.LG]  24 Feb 2024\n(1) Street Fighter II Gameplay\nPixel Extraction\n& Enumeration\n(3) Long Short Term Memory\nOutcome Prediction\nGameplay 25%\nGameplay 75%\nGameplay 95%\nPlayer 1 has 62% Chance of Winning\nPlayer 1 has 82% Chance of Winning\nPlayer 1 has 95% Chance of Winning\n(4) Outcome Prediction\n25%\n75%\n95%\n(2) Temporal Health Data\nT = 0\nT = 10\nT = 25\nT = 50\nT = 60\nT = 75\nT = 80\nT = 90\nT = 95\nσ\ntanh\nx\n+\ntanh\nx\nσ\nσ\nx\nEnd to end visualization of our research in outcome prediction in Super Street Fighter II Turbo with long short term memory\nnetworks (LSTMs).

EXISTING WORK\nQuantitative Analysis in E-sports: Koivisto and Hamari\n(2019) delve into the significance of gameplay metrics like\nscores and decision points, illustrating the strong link with\nplayer performance and engagement. Their work underscores\nthe intricate relationship between in-game strategies and learn-\ning outcomes, emphasizing the importance of these metrics in\nunderstanding player behavior and game dynamics [24].\nReal-Time Esports Prediction: Hodge (2021) pioneers live\nanalytics, particularly focusing on predicting outcomes in\nprofessional matches of games like DOTA 2 [31] The study\nemploys a diverse range of predictive models, from Logistic\nRegression to XGBoost, and tests them in major tournaments.\nRemarkably, their proposed models demonstrate up to 85%\naccuracy within the first five minutes of gameplay, marking a\nsignificant stride in real-time analytics [31].\nComprehensive Match Forecasting: Yang (2016) aims to\nenhance prediction accuracy for DOTA 2 matches by incorpo-\nrating a broad spectrum of pre-match and real-time features.\nBy analyzing a vast set of matches, Yang introduces novel\nmodels that boost prediction accuracy, demonstrating the role\nof real-time data in game progression. This research provides\nvaluable insights for players by combining historical and live\ndata for predictions [32].\nNeural Learning: The inception of the Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) architecture in 1997 marked a significant\nadvancement in time series analysis and deep learning. LSTMs\nhave since been applied to various fields [1]–[8].\nTransformer Attention Models: Introduced in 2017, the\nTransformer attention model [9] has revolutionized natural\nlanguage processing, replacing LSTMs. Its widespread adop-\ntion and recent advancements underscore its effectiveness and\nversatility across various domains, from audio synthesis to\nmedical data analysis [9]–[16].\nIII. METHODOLOGY\nA. Assumptions\nWe assume repeatability with the gameplay of players.\nWhile the gameplay of Super Street Fighter II Turbo uses\na variable set of commands for movement, we only utilize\nthe health bar of each player to analyze the progression of\nthe game. We therefore assume that gameplay mechanics,\nstrategies, character uniqueness, movements, player reactions,\nand decisions are all represented by changes in both players’\nhealth at each time step during gaming rounds.\nB. Data Collection\nSuper Street Fighter II Turbo is a popular two-player\nfighting game where each player can move, block, and attack\nto deal damage to the opposing player’s health. The goal\nis to reduce the opponent’s health to zero or have more\nhealth when the round time expires. The data was collected\nfrom 10 Super Street Fighter II Turbo full tournament videos.\nThese were collected from public tournament footage on\nYouTube. Overall, the data set contains 274,002 rows and 4\ncolumns, where each row corresponds to data extracted from\nan individual frame, sampled at a rate of 5 frames per second,\nor a single time-step in a round. This means that a single round\nmay span multiple rows in the data.\n• Winner - Represents the winner of each round. Used as\nthe target variable for training.\n• Round Progression - Represents the fraction of the\nround that elapsed at each time step.\n• Player1 Damaged% - Indicates the percentage of health\nlost by Player 1 due to Player 2’s actions at each timestep.\n• Player2 Damaged% - Indicates the percentage of health\nlost by Player 2 due to Player 1’s actions at each timestep.\nAfter selecting variables for training, the data was split into\nrounds. We explain this procedure below.\nC. Splitting Data into Rounds\nOur training and prediction models work on a ”round\nbasis,” meaning that data from each round needed to be\nseparated and extracted from the raw 274,002 rows. Using\nthe column Round Progression, we split the data into rounds.\nFor our study, we choose to retain 75% of the time steps.\nOther percentages, such as 25% and 95% were also tested to\ngain an understanding of the model’s predictive capabilities.\nWith the 75% time step data, the model was expected to\naccurately predict the winner of each round before it ended.\nThe percentage of time steps allotted to the model is significant\non its performance and real-world effectiveness. For instance,\na lower percentage, such as 25% may not be as accurate,\nbut would be more useful as it could conclude outcomes\nmuch quicker. However, a higher percentage, such as 95%,\ncould provide consistently correct outcomes due to the higher\nvolume of data for the model to interpret, but may not have\nany useful applications.\nIn order to split the rows into rounds, we used the col-\numn Round Progression, where the value 0.0 indicated the\nbeginning of a new round and 100.0 indicated the end. After\ndetermining the round ”boundaries,” we extracted the initial\npercentage of time steps from each of the rounds. For each\nround, the winner served as the target variable. Next, the data\nwas split into training and test sets. K-fold cross validation\nwas used with K set to 5 as our data set size was highly\nconstrained.\nFor each iteration, a set of sheets is designated as the test set,\nand the rest of the data is used for training. Specifically, the test\nset is determined by selecting data points from sheets indexed\nfrom Sheet i to Sheet (i+3), where i is a variable starting from\n2 and incrementing within the loop. The training set consists\nof data points from sheets not included in the test set. To\nminimize the risk of data leakage, no overlap between the\ndifferent sheets or videos was allowed between the sets. After\nsplitting, the train set contained 1154 (roughly 81.2%) rounds-\nsamples, and the test set contained 267 (roughly 18.7%)\nsamples.\nAfter pre-processing, the class distribution in the data was\nas follows:\n• Overall Data: 50.36% for label 0 & 49.64% for label 1.\n• Training: 53.81% for label 0 & 46.19% for label 1.\n• Test: 46.82% for label 0 & 53.18% for label 1.\nD. Padding Data\nEach data point or round in the splits has the shape\n(time steps, features). time steps represents the number of\nframes for which data has been retained, while features is the\nnumber of columns used for training (2 in our case). Due to\nvariation in the temporal sequence of our data, each sample\nhas a varying number of time steps. Thus, the samples needed\nto be padded so that they all maintained the same number of\ntime steps. We padded all our samples to the same sequence\nlength as a result. When 75% of the initial time steps were\nused, the maximum sequence length was 320 time steps. For\nthe Transformer model, we use a padding value of -1 and then\ngenerated a Boolean padding mask on it.\nContrary to standard practice in most sequential forecasting\napplications, we did not use 0 for padding. This is because\nthe feature values for when neither player took damage was\nalready 0. By utilizing the -1 padding, we easily generate\nmasks while retaining legitimate data points. For the LSTM\nmodel, the padding value itself was arbitrary and was thus set\nto 0, because the length of sequences before padding contained\nour information.\nIV. MODELS\nThis section outlines the models that were implemented and\ntested on the video game data. Results show a high level of\nperformance with LSTMs and Transformer attention-encoders.\nThe implementations of each respective model are detailed\nbelow.\nA. Baseline Machine Learning Models\n1) K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier (KNNs): The K-Nearest\nNeighbors (KNN) algorithm falls into the category of instance-\nbased learning algorithms. The predictions are made based on\nthe similarity of new data points to existing data points.\n2) Support Vector Classifier (SVMs) :\nSupport Vector\nMachines (SVMs) finds the optimal hyperplane that most\nefficiently separates different classes in the feature space. SVM\noperates by mapping input data into a higher-dimensional\nfeature space using a kernel function. SVM constructs a hy-\nperplane that maximizes the margin in this higher-dimensional\nspace which is distance between the hyperplane and the nearest\ndata points from each class.\n3) Random Forest Classifier (RF): The Random Forest\nClassifier combines the strength of multiple decision trees\nto make accurate predictions in classification tasks. It is\nwidely adopted in various domains such as healthcare, finance,\nand natural language processing due to its robustness and\neffectiveness.\nTABLE I\nCOMPARISON OF LSTM, TRANSFORMER, AND BASELINE MODELS IN PREDICTING ROUND OUTCOMES.\nModel\nROC-AUC Scores Across 5 Folds\nRound Progression\n25%\n75%\n95%\nLong Short Term Memory [1]\nFold 1\n0.64 ± 0.07\n0.94 ± 0.02\n0.95 ± 0.03\nFold 2\n0.67 ± 0.06\n0.94 ± 0.02\n0.96 ± 0.02\nFold 3\n0.65 ± 0.06\n0.93 ± 0.03\n0.98 ± 0.01\nFold 4\n0.63 ± 0.05\n0.93 ± 0.02\n0.97 ± 0.01\nFold 5\n0.65 ± 0.04\n0.93 ± 0.02\n0.95 ± 0.02\nTransformer [9]\nFold 1\n0.61 ± 0.07\n0.84 ± 0.05\n0.87 ± 0.05\nFold 2\n0.60 ± 0.06\n0.92 ± 0.03\n0.64 ± 0.06\nFold 3\n0.59 ± 0.06\n0.89 ± 0.03\n0.91 ± 0.03\nFold 4\n0.59 ± 0.05\n0.93 ± 0.02\n0.83 ± 0.04\nFold 5\n0.62 ± 0.05\n0.89 ± 0.02\n0.87 ± 0.03\nBaseline Models\nSupport Vector Machine [44]\nFold 1\n0.50 ± 0.07\n0.51 ± 0.07\n0.49 ± 0.07\nFold 2\n0.52 ± 0.07\n0.50 ± 0.07\n0.49 ± 0.06\nFold 3\n0.55 ± 0.06\n0.51 ± 0.06\n0.49 ± 0.06\nFold 4\n0.49 ± 0.05\n0.52 ± 0.05\n0.51 ± 0.04\nFold 5\n0.48 ± 0.04\n0.49 ± 0.04\n0.48 ± 0.04\nRandom Forest Classifer [45]\nFold 1\n0.49 ± 0.07\n0.66 ± 0.07\n0.49 ± 0.07\nFold 2\n0.54 ± 0.06\n0.67 ± 0.06\n0.49 ± 0.06\nFold 3\n0.54 ± 0.06\n0.63 ± 0.06\n0.49 ± 0.06\nFold 4\n0.53 ± 0.04\n0.63 ± 0.04\n0.51 ± 0.04\nFold 5\n0.57 ± 0.05\n0.69 ± 0.04\n0.48 ± 0.04\nK-Nearest Neighbors [46]\nFold 1\n0.49 ± 0.07\n0.51 ± 0.07\n0.51 ± 0.07\nFold 2\n0.57 ± 0.06\n0.55 ± 0.06\n0.54 ± 0.06\nFold 3\n0.57 ± 0.06\n0.55 ± 0.06\n0.56 ± 0.06\nFold 4\n0.48 ± 0.05\n0.47 ± 0.05\n0.48 ± 0.05\nFold 5\n0.45 ± 0.04\n0.50 ± 0.04\n0.49 ± 0.04\nB. Long Short-Term Memory Classifier\nThe Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM) model consists of\nthe following hyper parameters:\n• Output Sequence Length : The output feature dimension\nof the LSTM layer was set to 8.\n• Dropout : A dropout of 30% was utilized to reduce over-\nfitting.\n• Classifier Head : The output of our LSTM layer was\naveraged along the time step dimension.\nC. Transformer Classifier\nThe Transformer described in Attention is All You Need\nconsists of two main branches - an encoder and a decoder.\nThe encoder can access its input sequence in its entirety\nand provides ”context” that is passed to the decoder [9] The\ndecoder is an auto regressive component that can only access\nvalues it has generated previously, as well as the encoder\noutput. The decoder predicts the next value in the sequence,\nusing the ”context” provided by the encoder and its own\noutputs from earlier time steps, which is similar to how LSTMs\nwork. The Transformer model in our benchmark tests utilizes\nonly the Transformer encoder to process time steps from the\nrounds, inspired by encoder-only models like BERT [20] or\nRoBERTa [21] that learn to predict tokens that have been\nmasked out of input sequences. For our use case, the contextual\ninformation from the encoder is averaged along the time\nstep dimension, like in the LSTM model, and passed to the\nclassifier head for final prediction. However, it should be noted\nthat models like BERT use an alternative approach where a\nspecial token called [CLS] is pre-appended to input sequences\n[20] The state of this token is extracted from the encoder\noutput to serve as the final classification result produced by\nthe model. The hyperparameters of our Transformer encoder-\nbased classifier is as follows:\n• Linear Embedding Layer: The output dimension of this\nmodel was set to 8.\n• Positional Encoding: Dropout of 30% and maximum vo-\ncabulary size of 722 are used in the positional encoding.\n• Encoder: The dimension of the feed forward network at\nthe end of the encoder was set to 8, the number of heads\nin our multi-head attention was set to a size of 4.\nD. Training Procedure\nFor both classifiers, the Adam optimization algorithm [22]\nwas used. The binary cross-entropy function with logits was\nchosen as the loss function to minimize. The binary cross-\nentropy loss function is given by the following equation:\n−1\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\nyi log ˆyi + (1 −yi) log (1 −yi)\nThe learning rate for the Transformer model was set to 0.0006,\nwhile the LSTM learning rate was set to 0.001.

The batch size for training was set to 28 for the\nTransformer model and 64 for the LSTM model. Both models\nwere trained for 500 epochs across 5 folds.\nV. RESULTS\nIn this study, the output logits were converted to proba-\nbilities using the sigmoid activation function, allowing us to\nproperly benchmark the models. For the training sets, metrics\nwere collected and averaged for each epoch over 5 training\nruns. For the test set, the model was evaluated once at the end\nof each training run - results were later averaged as well.\nWithin 400 epochs of training, neither model converged.\nHowever, judging by loss alone, the Transformer model\nperformed better on the training set relative to its test set\ncompared to the LSTM classifier. The LSTM model achieved\nlower test loss than the Transformer model due to the latter\nover-fitting.\nTABLE II\nLSTM AND TRANSFORMER INFERENCE TIME ACROSS FIVE FOLDS\nRound Progression (%)\nModel\n25%\n50%\n95%\nLSTM (ms)\n0.781 ± 0.241\n2.203 ± 0.752\n2.768 ± 0.945\nTransformer (ms)\n1.737 ± 3.326\n2.058 ± 3.519\n2.428 ± 4.087\nVI. DISCUSSION\nBoth Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) and\nTransformer Attention Models were shown to be effective in\nreal-time forecasting. The LSTM classifier exhibits marginal\nperformance gains in key indicators such as AUC (Area Under\nthe Curve). In an effort to test the models’ robustness, we\nalso evaluated their performance on a round progression of\n95%. Interestingly, this evaluation did not lead to a significant\nimprovement in performance. However, we give metrics for\nmodels trained on just 25% percent of the initial time steps\nin the rounds. We can see that performance significantly\ndegrades with a lower percentage of data points included. With\nregards to our method, prior research shows (Sak et al. 2014)\nthat LSTMs being sequential, have difficulty processing long\nsequences [19]. While LSTMs were proficient for the smaller-\nscale applications, its performance could be largely improved\nby further exploration into its architecture. The Transformer\nencoder can effectively handle parallelization and sequence\nlength issues. This was due to its distinctive components,\nsuch as positional encoding and diagonal look-ahead masks,\nallowing it to handle large sequential tasks.\nA. Limitations\nWhile we acknowledge the small size of our data set as a\nkey limitation in our study, as a potential solution, we refer\nto Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019), [34] which demonstrate\nthe potential of data augmentation techniques tailored to spe-\ncific data set characteristics. Explorations of these techniques\nthat introduce perturbations in player actions might enhance\neach model’s ability to generalize within diverse gameplay\nscenarios. Furthermore, data from Youtube videos typically\nhighlight key moments in a game round. Thus, the gameplay\nbehaviors may not be representative of all Super Street Fighter\nII Turbo gameplay as a whole. We acknowledge that our\ndata set may be limited to highlights or gameplay between\nprofessionals in unusual moments. These are all outliers, and\ntherefore it is unclear whether our model would be effective on\ndetermining outcomes between casual players. As a solution,\nfuture work will involve collecting data from a broader range\nof participants, ranging from new entrants to experts.\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate the predictive capacity of\nLSTMs for player outcomes in two player games. Our pre-\nliminary work can further engage the audience in anticipa-\ntion of gaming outcomes. Audience-centric considerations are\nnecessary in entertainment; predictions on gameplay bridge\nthe gap between competition and the viewer’s immersion in\nentertainment experience. Future work may involve in-game\npose estimation to further predictive performance. This may\nalso be useful in predicting behavioral or emotional changes\nfor the players. For example, one could apply our predictive\nanalysis method towards the detection of ’skill drop moments’\nduring game play for an understanding of human computer\ninteractions (HCI). We also suggest hybrid architectures which\ncombine the strength of different models for future work.\nResearch by Pham et al. (2018) [35] delves deeper into or en-\nsemble learning, suggesting that hybrid models can ultimately\noutperform individual architectures [34]. We hope our work\nserves as a groundwork for furthering research in predicting\noutcomes in other games within E-ports.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to acknowledge Capcom Co., Ltd for game-\nplay videos of Super Street Fighter II Turbo.

However, making such\nreal-time predictions is challenging due to unpredictable variables within the\ngame involving diverse player strategies and decision-making. Our work attempts\nto enhance audience engagement within video game tournaments by introducing a\nreal-time method of predicting wins. Our Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTMs)\nbased approach enables efficient predictions of win-lose outcomes by only using\nthe health indicator of each player as a time series.

INTRODUCTION\nArtificial intelligence has become increasingly relevant in\nrecent years, with various applications in forecasting unseen\noutcomes within sports matches [23], [29]. Various deep learn-\ning approaches have been utilized to forecast the outcomes of\ncompetitive matches [38], [41]. One popular application per-\ntains to audience engagement in electronic sports (E-sports),\nwhere an estimated 71 million people watched competitive\ngaming in 2014 [39]. In 2015, DOTA 2 offered a 18 million\nUSD prize pool for its annual tournament, considered the\nlargest esport event in history [40]. The growing field of\nesports highlights the need for systematic in-game analysis\n[42]. These analytics focus on analyzing data from behavioral\npatterns to identify insightful trends [43]. Analytics also assists\ncompetitors to make an informed decisions and improving\nunderstanding of the gameplay tactics. Most importantly, it can\nsimplify in-game dynamics for the viewers, while promoting\naudience engagement through the use of data driven outcome\nprediction models.\nHowever, current forecasting of outcomes in sports is\nlimited to pre-match outcome predictions. While win-lose\nforecasts can directly tie in with the engagement of the\naudience, traditional sports does not have access to the real-\ntime information necessary to solve this problem. Typically,\n∗Kittimate Chulajata and Sean Wu contributed equally to this research and\nare co-first authors.\n† Open Source Github Repository\nthis gap in real-time analysis and prediction is compensated\nby live commentary, where experts draw upon their experience\nto forecast the most probable outcomes of the match. In the\ntraditional sports, similarly to finance, most predictions rely\nheavily on historical data, such as player statistics or past per-\nformances, to predict the outcome [29]. Thus, these methods\nlack the ability to take real-time events into consideration.\nEsports, on the other hand, is rich in information, opening\nup the opportunity to solve this real-time prediction problem.\nEsports offer the advantage of generating real-time data due\nto ease of access with its digital format. As a consequence,\nvarious applications involving video game datasets are emerg-\ning. [18], [30] While there have been multiple attempts to\nsolve this problem, [31] there have yet to exist a robust yet\nreal-time forecasting method for two player games.\nTime series forecasting based on Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) shows remarkable performance both inside [32] and\noutside Esports [1], [3], [9]. In particular, we focus on the\nreal-time forcasting problem using Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM) [1]. As proof of concept, we predict the live outcomes\nof a two-player arcade game, Super Street Fighter II Turbo.\nOur approach leverages the percentage of health bar loss for\neach player, allowing for predictions at different stages of the\nmatch in real time.\nThus, our LSTM-based approach involves real-time, mid-\nmatch data sets to predict outcomes at varying time-steps. We\nexperiment at different slices of the game round progression\n(25%, 75%, and 95%). We attempt to capture the sequential\ndynamics of two player games as a means of providing greater\nimmersive engagement for the E-sports viewers. By utilizing\nthe percent changes in the health bar of both players, which\nreflect the extent of damage inflicted, we suggest an approach\nthat is a step towards real-time game play analysis.\nConsequently, our contributions are as follows:\n• Robust prediction of gaming outcomes in two player\ngames mid-round (25%, 75%, & 95%) using Long Short\nTerm Memory Networks (LSTMs) as a means of enhanc-\ning audience engagement.\n• An open-source data set with code to further research\nin predictive time series analysis for two-player arcade\ngames.\narXiv:2402.15923v1  [cs.LG]  24 Feb 2024\n(1) Street Fighter II Gameplay\nPixel Extraction\n& Enumeration\n(3) Long Short Term Memory\nOutcome Prediction\nGameplay 25%\nGameplay 75%\nGameplay 95%\nPlayer 1 has 62% Chance of Winning\nPlayer 1 has 82% Chance of Winning\nPlayer 1 has 95% Chance of Winning\n(4) Outcome Prediction\n25%\n75%\n95%\n(2) Temporal Health Data\nT = 0\nT = 10\nT = 25\nT = 50\nT = 60\nT = 75\nT = 80\nT = 90\nT = 95\nσ\ntanh\nx\n+\ntanh\nx\nσ\nσ\nx\nEnd to end visualization of our research in outcome prediction in Super Street Fighter II Turbo with long short term memory\nnetworks (LSTMs).

EXISTING WORK\nQuantitative Analysis in E-sports: Koivisto and Hamari\n(2019) delve into the significance of gameplay metrics like\nscores and decision points, illustrating the strong link with\nplayer performance and engagement. Their work underscores\nthe intricate relationship between in-game strategies and learn-\ning outcomes, emphasizing the importance of these metrics in\nunderstanding player behavior and game dynamics [24].\nReal-Time Esports Prediction: Hodge (2021) pioneers live\nanalytics, particularly focusing on predicting outcomes in\nprofessional matches of games like DOTA 2 [31] The study\nemploys a diverse range of predictive models, from Logistic\nRegression to XGBoost, and tests them in major tournaments.\nRemarkably, their proposed models demonstrate up to 85%\naccuracy within the first five minutes of gameplay, marking a\nsignificant stride in real-time analytics [31].\nComprehensive Match Forecasting: Yang (2016) aims to\nenhance prediction accuracy for DOTA 2 matches by incorpo-\nrating a broad spectrum of pre-match and real-time features.\nBy analyzing a vast set of matches, Yang introduces novel\nmodels that boost prediction accuracy, demonstrating the role\nof real-time data in game progression. This research provides\nvaluable insights for players by combining historical and live\ndata for predictions [32].\nNeural Learning: The inception of the Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) architecture in 1997 marked a significant\nadvancement in time series analysis and deep learning. LSTMs\nhave since been applied to various fields [1]–[8].\nTransformer Attention Models: Introduced in 2017, the\nTransformer attention model [9] has revolutionized natural\nlanguage processing, replacing LSTMs. Its widespread adop-\ntion and recent advancements underscore its effectiveness and\nversatility across various domains, from audio synthesis to\nmedical data analysis [9]–[16].\nIII. METHODOLOGY\nA. Assumptions\nWe assume repeatability with the gameplay of players.\nWhile the gameplay of Super Street Fighter II Turbo uses\na variable set of commands for movement, we only utilize\nthe health bar of each player to analyze the progression of\nthe game. We therefore assume that gameplay mechanics,\nstrategies, character uniqueness, movements, player reactions,\nand decisions are all represented by changes in both players’\nhealth at each time step during gaming rounds.\nB. Data Collection\nSuper Street Fighter II Turbo is a popular two-player\nfighting game where each player can move, block, and attack\nto deal damage to the opposing player’s health. The goal\nis to reduce the opponent’s health to zero or have more\nhealth when the round time expires. The data was collected\nfrom 10 Super Street Fighter II Turbo full tournament videos.\nThese were collected from public tournament footage on\nYouTube. Overall, the data set contains 274,002 rows and 4\ncolumns, where each row corresponds to data extracted from\nan individual frame, sampled at a rate of 5 frames per second,\nor a single time-step in a round. This means that a single round\nmay span multiple rows in the data.\n• Winner - Represents the winner of each round. Used as\nthe target variable for training.\n• Round Progression - Represents the fraction of the\nround that elapsed at each time step.\n• Player1 Damaged% - Indicates the percentage of health\nlost by Player 1 due to Player 2’s actions at each timestep.\n• Player2 Damaged% - Indicates the percentage of health\nlost by Player 2 due to Player 1’s actions at each timestep.\nAfter selecting variables for training, the data was split into\nrounds. We explain this procedure below.\nC. Splitting Data into Rounds\nOur training and prediction models work on a ”round\nbasis,” meaning that data from each round needed to be\nseparated and extracted from the raw 274,002 rows. Using\nthe column Round Progression, we split the data into rounds.\nFor our study, we choose to retain 75% of the time steps.\nOther percentages, such as 25% and 95% were also tested to\ngain an understanding of the model’s predictive capabilities.\nWith the 75% time step data, the model was expected to\naccurately predict the winner of each round before it ended.\nThe percentage of time steps allotted to the model is significant\non its performance and real-world effectiveness. For instance,\na lower percentage, such as 25% may not be as accurate,\nbut would be more useful as it could conclude outcomes\nmuch quicker. However, a higher percentage, such as 95%,\ncould provide consistently correct outcomes due to the higher\nvolume of data for the model to interpret, but may not have\nany useful applications.\nIn order to split the rows into rounds, we used the col-\numn Round Progression, where the value 0.0 indicated the\nbeginning of a new round and 100.0 indicated the end. After\ndetermining the round ”boundaries,” we extracted the initial\npercentage of time steps from each of the rounds. For each\nround, the winner served as the target variable. Next, the data\nwas split into training and test sets. K-fold cross validation\nwas used with K set to 5 as our data set size was highly\nconstrained.\nFor each iteration, a set of sheets is designated as the test set,\nand the rest of the data is used for training. Specifically, the test\nset is determined by selecting data points from sheets indexed\nfrom Sheet i to Sheet (i+3), where i is a variable starting from\n2 and incrementing within the loop. The training set consists\nof data points from sheets not included in the test set. To\nminimize the risk of data leakage, no overlap between the\ndifferent sheets or videos was allowed between the sets. After\nsplitting, the train set contained 1154 (roughly 81.2%) rounds-\nsamples, and the test set contained 267 (roughly 18.7%)\nsamples.\nAfter pre-processing, the class distribution in the data was\nas follows:\n• Overall Data: 50.36% for label 0 & 49.64% for label 1.\n• Training: 53.81% for label 0 & 46.19% for label 1.\n• Test: 46.82% for label 0 & 53.18% for label 1.\nD. Padding Data\nEach data point or round in the splits has the shape\n(time steps, features). time steps represents the number of\nframes for which data has been retained, while features is the\nnumber of columns used for training (2 in our case). Due to\nvariation in the temporal sequence of our data, each sample\nhas a varying number of time steps. Thus, the samples needed\nto be padded so that they all maintained the same number of\ntime steps. We padded all our samples to the same sequence\nlength as a result. When 75% of the initial time steps were\nused, the maximum sequence length was 320 time steps. For\nthe Transformer model, we use a padding value of -1 and then\ngenerated a Boolean padding mask on it.\nContrary to standard practice in most sequential forecasting\napplications, we did not use 0 for padding. This is because\nthe feature values for when neither player took damage was\nalready 0. By utilizing the -1 padding, we easily generate\nmasks while retaining legitimate data points. For the LSTM\nmodel, the padding value itself was arbitrary and was thus set\nto 0, because the length of sequences before padding contained\nour information.\nIV. MODELS\nThis section outlines the models that were implemented and\ntested on the video game data. Results show a high level of\nperformance with LSTMs and Transformer attention-encoders.\nThe implementations of each respective model are detailed\nbelow.\nA. Baseline Machine Learning Models\n1) K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier (KNNs): The K-Nearest\nNeighbors (KNN) algorithm falls into the category of instance-\nbased learning algorithms. The predictions are made based on\nthe similarity of new data points to existing data points.\n2) Support Vector Classifier (SVMs) :\nSupport Vector\nMachines (SVMs) finds the optimal hyperplane that most\nefficiently separates different classes in the feature space. SVM\noperates by mapping input data into a higher-dimensional\nfeature space using a kernel function. SVM constructs a hy-\nperplane that maximizes the margin in this higher-dimensional\nspace which is distance between the hyperplane and the nearest\ndata points from each class.\n3) Random Forest Classifier (RF): The Random Forest\nClassifier combines the strength of multiple decision trees\nto make accurate predictions in classification tasks. It is\nwidely adopted in various domains such as healthcare, finance,\nand natural language processing due to its robustness and\neffectiveness.\nTABLE I\nCOMPARISON OF LSTM, TRANSFORMER, AND BASELINE MODELS IN PREDICTING ROUND OUTCOMES.\nModel\nROC-AUC Scores Across 5 Folds\nRound Progression\n25%\n75%\n95%\nLong Short Term Memory [1]\nFold 1\n0.64 ± 0.07\n0.94 ± 0.02\n0.95 ± 0.03\nFold 2\n0.67 ± 0.06\n0.94 ± 0.02\n0.96 ± 0.02\nFold 3\n0.65 ± 0.06\n0.93 ± 0.03\n0.98 ± 0.01\nFold 4\n0.63 ± 0.05\n0.93 ± 0.02\n0.97 ± 0.01\nFold 5\n0.65 ± 0.04\n0.93 ± 0.02\n0.95 ± 0.02\nTransformer [9]\nFold 1\n0.61 ± 0.07\n0.84 ± 0.05\n0.87 ± 0.05\nFold 2\n0.60 ± 0.06\n0.92 ± 0.03\n0.64 ± 0.06\nFold 3\n0.59 ± 0.06\n0.89 ± 0.03\n0.91 ± 0.03\nFold 4\n0.59 ± 0.05\n0.93 ± 0.02\n0.83 ± 0.04\nFold 5\n0.62 ± 0.05\n0.89 ± 0.02\n0.87 ± 0.03\nBaseline Models\nSupport Vector Machine [44]\nFold 1\n0.50 ± 0.07\n0.51 ± 0.07\n0.49 ± 0.07\nFold 2\n0.52 ± 0.07\n0.50 ± 0.07\n0.49 ± 0.06\nFold 3\n0.55 ± 0.06\n0.51 ± 0.06\n0.49 ± 0.06\nFold 4\n0.49 ± 0.05\n0.52 ± 0.05\n0.51 ± 0.04\nFold 5\n0.48 ± 0.04\n0.49 ± 0.04\n0.48 ± 0.04\nRandom Forest Classifer [45]\nFold 1\n0.49 ± 0.07\n0.66 ± 0.07\n0.49 ± 0.07\nFold 2\n0.54 ± 0.06\n0.67 ± 0.06\n0.49 ± 0.06\nFold 3\n0.54 ± 0.06\n0.63 ± 0.06\n0.49 ± 0.06\nFold 4\n0.53 ± 0.04\n0.63 ± 0.04\n0.51 ± 0.04\nFold 5\n0.57 ± 0.05\n0.69 ± 0.04\n0.48 ± 0.04\nK-Nearest Neighbors [46]\nFold 1\n0.49 ± 0.07\n0.51 ± 0.07\n0.51 ± 0.07\nFold 2\n0.57 ± 0.06\n0.55 ± 0.06\n0.54 ± 0.06\nFold 3\n0.57 ± 0.06\n0.55 ± 0.06\n0.56 ± 0.06\nFold 4\n0.48 ± 0.05\n0.47 ± 0.05\n0.48 ± 0.05\nFold 5\n0.45 ± 0.04\n0.50 ± 0.04\n0.49 ± 0.04\nB. Long Short-Term Memory Classifier\nThe Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM) model consists of\nthe following hyper parameters:\n• Output Sequence Length : The output feature dimension\nof the LSTM layer was set to 8.\n• Dropout : A dropout of 30% was utilized to reduce over-\nfitting.\n• Classifier Head : The output of our LSTM layer was\naveraged along the time step dimension.\nC. Transformer Classifier\nThe Transformer described in Attention is All You Need\nconsists of two main branches - an encoder and a decoder.\nThe encoder can access its input sequence in its entirety\nand provides ”context” that is passed to the decoder [9] The\ndecoder is an auto regressive component that can only access\nvalues it has generated previously, as well as the encoder\noutput. The decoder predicts the next value in the sequence,\nusing the ”context” provided by the encoder and its own\noutputs from earlier time steps, which is similar to how LSTMs\nwork. The Transformer model in our benchmark tests utilizes\nonly the Transformer encoder to process time steps from the\nrounds, inspired by encoder-only models like BERT [20] or\nRoBERTa [21] that learn to predict tokens that have been\nmasked out of input sequences. For our use case, the contextual\ninformation from the encoder is averaged along the time\nstep dimension, like in the LSTM model, and passed to the\nclassifier head for final prediction. However, it should be noted\nthat models like BERT use an alternative approach where a\nspecial token called [CLS] is pre-appended to input sequences\n[20] The state of this token is extracted from the encoder\noutput to serve as the final classification result produced by\nthe model. The hyperparameters of our Transformer encoder-\nbased classifier is as follows:\n• Linear Embedding Layer: The output dimension of this\nmodel was set to 8.\n• Positional Encoding: Dropout of 30% and maximum vo-\ncabulary size of 722 are used in the positional encoding.\n• Encoder: The dimension of the feed forward network at\nthe end of the encoder was set to 8, the number of heads\nin our multi-head attention was set to a size of 4.\nD. Training Procedure\nFor both classifiers, the Adam optimization algorithm [22]\nwas used. The binary cross-entropy function with logits was\nchosen as the loss function to minimize. The binary cross-\nentropy loss function is given by the following equation:\n−1\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\nyi log ˆyi + (1 −yi) log (1 −yi)\nThe learning rate for the Transformer model was set to 0.0006,\nwhile the LSTM learning rate was set to 0.001.

The batch size for training was set to 28 for the\nTransformer model and 64 for the LSTM model. Both models\nwere trained for 500 epochs across 5 folds.\nV. RESULTS\nIn this study, the output logits were converted to proba-\nbilities using the sigmoid activation function, allowing us to\nproperly benchmark the models. For the training sets, metrics\nwere collected and averaged for each epoch over 5 training\nruns. For the test set, the model was evaluated once at the end\nof each training run - results were later averaged as well.\nWithin 400 epochs of training, neither model converged.\nHowever, judging by loss alone, the Transformer model\nperformed better on the training set relative to its test set\ncompared to the LSTM classifier. The LSTM model achieved\nlower test loss than the Transformer model due to the latter\nover-fitting.\nTABLE II\nLSTM AND TRANSFORMER INFERENCE TIME ACROSS FIVE FOLDS\nRound Progression (%)\nModel\n25%\n50%\n95%\nLSTM (ms)\n0.781 ± 0.241\n2.203 ± 0.752\n2.768 ± 0.945\nTransformer (ms)\n1.737 ± 3.326\n2.058 ± 3.519\n2.428 ± 4.087\nVI. DISCUSSION\nBoth Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) and\nTransformer Attention Models were shown to be effective in\nreal-time forecasting. The LSTM classifier exhibits marginal\nperformance gains in key indicators such as AUC (Area Under\nthe Curve). In an effort to test the models’ robustness, we\nalso evaluated their performance on a round progression of\n95%. Interestingly, this evaluation did not lead to a significant\nimprovement in performance. However, we give metrics for\nmodels trained on just 25% percent of the initial time steps\nin the rounds. We can see that performance significantly\ndegrades with a lower percentage of data points included. With\nregards to our method, prior research shows (Sak et al. 2014)\nthat LSTMs being sequential, have difficulty processing long\nsequences [19]. While LSTMs were proficient for the smaller-\nscale applications, its performance could be largely improved\nby further exploration into its architecture. The Transformer\nencoder can effectively handle parallelization and sequence\nlength issues. This was due to its distinctive components,\nsuch as positional encoding and diagonal look-ahead masks,\nallowing it to handle large sequential tasks.\nA. Limitations\nWhile we acknowledge the small size of our data set as a\nkey limitation in our study, as a potential solution, we refer\nto Shorten and Khoshgoftaar (2019), [34] which demonstrate\nthe potential of data augmentation techniques tailored to spe-\ncific data set characteristics. Explorations of these techniques\nthat introduce perturbations in player actions might enhance\neach model’s ability to generalize within diverse gameplay\nscenarios. Furthermore, data from Youtube videos typically\nhighlight key moments in a game round. Thus, the gameplay\nbehaviors may not be representative of all Super Street Fighter\nII Turbo gameplay as a whole. We acknowledge that our\ndata set may be limited to highlights or gameplay between\nprofessionals in unusual moments. These are all outliers, and\ntherefore it is unclear whether our model would be effective on\ndetermining outcomes between casual players. As a solution,\nfuture work will involve collecting data from a broader range\nof participants, ranging from new entrants to experts.\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate the predictive capacity of\nLSTMs for player outcomes in two player games. Our pre-\nliminary work can further engage the audience in anticipa-\ntion of gaming outcomes. Audience-centric considerations are\nnecessary in entertainment; predictions on gameplay bridge\nthe gap between competition and the viewer’s immersion in\nentertainment experience. Future work may involve in-game\npose estimation to further predictive performance. This may\nalso be useful in predicting behavioral or emotional changes\nfor the players. For example, one could apply our predictive\nanalysis method towards the detection of ’skill drop moments’\nduring game play for an understanding of human computer\ninteractions (HCI). We also suggest hybrid architectures which\ncombine the strength of different models for future work.\nResearch by Pham et al. (2018) [35] delves deeper into or en-\nsemble learning, suggesting that hybrid models can ultimately\noutperform individual architectures [34]. We hope our work\nserves as a groundwork for furthering research in predicting\noutcomes in other games within E-ports.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to acknowledge Capcom Co., Ltd for game-\nplay videos of Super Street Fighter II Turbo.

Dick’s seminal\nnovel underscores a fundamental divide between artificial intelligence and humanity – the capacity for\ngenuine emotion. In our modern era, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]\nhave achieved remarkable performance, even surpassing human capabilities in domains such as\nperception and cognition. However, when it comes to the realm of emotions, state-of-the-art MLLMs\nappear to be lacking in their ability to accurately interpret and respond to emotional cues. While\nexisting MLLMs can generate basic responses to human queries regarding emotional aspects, the\naccuracy of their responses remains unsatisfactory, especially in nuanced categories such as fear and\nanger (Fig. 1(b)). Moreover, even LLMs that have been employed for text-based emotional analysis\noften fall short when confronted with the complexities of multimodal emotional tasks, which require\nthe integration of visual, auditory, and textual cues. A primary factor contributing to this limitation is\nthe scarcity of comprehensive emotional datasets for training MLLMs, as publicly available datasets\ngenerally focus on objective visual abilities [7]. This gap not only mirrors the philosophical questions\nraised by Dick’s narrative but also motivates us to explore the vast, uncharted territories of emotional\nintelligence within MLLMs.\n*Corresponding Author\narXiv:2406.16442v2  [cs.CV]  29 Jun 2024\nEmotion Understanding \nWhat is the emotion \nin this picture?\nThe emotion in the \nimage is exciting\nEmotional\nUniversal \nTasks\nEmotional \nApplication\nTasks\nUser Query\nThe image conveys a \nsense of Happy\na.

(c) Overview of the diverse tasks in EmoBench, including emotional\nuniversal tasks, emotional application tasks (hate, sarcasm, and humor detection).\nTo bridge this gap, we propose EmoBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to serve two critical\nfunctions: providing a rich source of training materials to enhance the performance of MLLMs and\nevaluating their emotional understanding capabilities. EmoBench encompasses a diverse range of\ntasks (Fig. 1), which we categorize into Universal Emotional Tasks and Emotional Application Tasks.\nUniversal Emotional Tasks include multimodal emotion recognition and intent understanding, both\nrepresented as a classification paradigm. Emotional Application Tasks, on the other hand, focus on\nspecific challenges in social media applications, such as Hate, Sarcasm, and Humor Detection. To\nconstruct EmoBench, we first collected a diverse dataset for each subtask, as illustrated in Tab. 1.\nSubsequently, we employed GPT-4 [1] to generate a wide array of question templates for each subtask,\nultimately compiling a dataset of approximately 287,000 multimodal instructions. By offering a\nlarge-scale, diverse, and carefully curated dataset, EmoBench enables rigorous enhancement and\nevaluation of the emotional understanding capabilities of MLLMs.\nWith our proposed EmoBench, existing MLLMs can be empowered with better emotional understand-\ning capabilities with downstream fine-tuning. Current MLLMs typically follow a two-step process:\nmodality projection and LLM reasoning. However, these models still struggle to effectively capture\nand reason about the complex and nuanced emotions present in multimodal data. To address this chal-\nlenge, we propose EmoLLM, a novel model that incorporates two key techniques: Multi-perspective\nVisual Projection and EmoPrompt. Multi-perspective Visual Projection captures diverse emotional\ncues by considering multiple viewpoints. Specifically, we use the features of objects in different\nfeature maps as content information and construct the objects and their relationships as graph-based\nrelational information. By jointly mining these two aspects of information, we can extract features\nthat are more suitable for emotional tasks.\nIn the reasoning stage, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [8] is a common and effective method. Inspired by\nCoT, we first let EmoLLM observe objects in multimedia data and then infer emotions based on these\nobservations. However, a significant problem arises, i.e., the correctness of the first-stage observations\ndetermines the accuracy of the final inference. To mitigate this issue, EmoPrompt incorporates\nspecific examples stored for the current task. To ensure the correctness of these examples, we present\nGPT-4V with data samples and ground truth labels to obtain an accurate CoT process. Whenever a\nprompt is required, EmoPrompt selects one such example to guide the reasoning process.\nWe summarize our contributions as follows:\n• We introduce EmoBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to enhance and evaluate the\nemotional understanding capabilities of MLLMs across a diverse range of tasks, providing a\nlarge-scale dataset of ~287k instructions.\n• We propose EmoLLM, which incorporates Multi-perspective Visual Projection to capture\ndiverse emotional cues and EmoPrompt to guide the reasoning process.\n• We conduct extensive experiments on the EmoBench benchmark, demonstrating that\nEmoLLM achieves substantial improvements over baseline models, with an average im-\nprovement of 12.1% across multiple foundation models.\n2\nTable 1: The statistics of various data sources in EmoBench.\nCategory\nSub-task\nDataset\nModality\nSampled Size (k)\nq\n2\n5\n4\nTrain\nVal & Test\nUniversal\nEmotional\nTasks\nEmotion\nEmotic [12; 13]\n✗\n✓\n✗\n✗\n16.2\n6.4\nEmotion\nCaer-S [45]\n✗\n✓\n✗\n✗\n42.0\n21.0\nEmotion\nMeld [11]\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✓\n11.1\n2.6\nEmotion\nEmotion_6 [46]\n✗\n✓\n✗\n✗\n1.3\n0.6\nIntention\nMintRec [23]\n✗\n✓\n✗\n✗\n1.7\n0.4\nEmotional\nApplication\nTasks\nHumor\nSMILE [47]\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✓\n8.6\n1.0\nHate\nMMHS [48]\n✓\n✓\n✗\n✗\n139.8\n10\nSarcasm\nMMSD [49]\n✓\n✗\n✓\n✓\n22.2\n2.4\n2\nRelated Works\n2.1\nMulti-modality Emotional Tasks and Methods\nMultimodal emotion recognition, which analyzes feelings through speech, text, and visual cues,\nhas been a growing area of research. Early datasets like IEMOCAP [9] provide vital audiovisual\ninteraction data but are limited by their focus on scripted events and lack of speaker diversity.\nSubsequent datasets, such as CMU-MOSEI [10] and MELD [11], address these limitations by\noffering more naturalistic expressions from videos and television shows. Emotic [12; 13] and\nGoEmotions [14] further expand the scope of resources for emotion recognition. In the related field of\nintention understanding, contemporary datasets like CLINC150 [15], HWU64 [16], Intentonomy [17],\nSnips [18], MDID [19], MSED [20], and BANKING77 [21] are derived from a diverse range of\nsources, including online forums and social media to explore the user intent [22]. The MIntRec\ndataset [23] takes a unique approach by utilizing TV series clips to capture the complex intentions\nportrayed by actors.\nBuilding upon these datasets, numerous methods [24; 25; 26] have been proposed to advance the field\nof multimodal emotion recognition. Lee et al. [27] introduce the Multimodal Transformer (MulT),\nwhich employs the vanilla Transformer [28] architecture and directional cross-modal attention to learn\neffective multimodal language representations. Hazarika et al. [29] propose Modality-Invariant and\n-Specific Representations (MISA), which differentiates modality features into invariant and specific\nsubspaces to aid in fusion and prediction. Yang et al. [30] introduce MFSA, a transformer-based\nmodel that leverages adversarial learning to create modality-specific and -agnostic representations for\nsentiment recognition. Recently, Zhang et al. [31] attempted to use GPT [1] to convert multimodal\nemotion tasks into text emotion recognition. However, this approach relies on pre-processing by an\nMLLM and is not suitable for practical applications.\n2.2\nMulti-modality Large Language Models\nLarge language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 [1], Gemini-Pro [32], and LLaVA [33], have\ndemonstrated remarkable language abilities in capturing general knowledge. By incorporating visual\nand audio inputs into LLMs using techniques like CLIP [34] and additional adapting modules [35;\n36], multi-modality large language models (MLLMs) [37; 38; 39] have been developed to tackle\na variety of multi-modal tasks. These tasks include image captioning [40; 41], visual question\nanswering (VQA) [42; 43], and other language-related capabilities [44]. However, as revealed by our\nprevious research (Fig. 1 b), the emotional understanding abilities of MLLMs remain unsatisfactory,\nparticularly when dealing with complex emotions such as anger and fear, or emotional categories that\nrequire reasoning. We attribute this limitation primarily to the lack of relevant data and specialized\nmodels. To address this issue, we introduce EmoBench, the first emotional instruction tuning dataset\ndesigned to enhance the emotional understanding capabilities of various MLLMs and enable them to\nbetter navigate the realm of emotional comprehension.\n3\n(a) Collect Emotional Data (With label)\nIn-the-wild\nTV \/ movie\nSample\nClean\n287k Content \nDatabase\n(b) Define Emotional Tasks and Prompts\nEmotional\nUniversal  \nTasks\nEmotional \nApplication\nTasks\nTaxonomy\n(c) Diverse Instruction Generation\nChoose one emotional category that best \nmatches the given image from these choices: \n[anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, \nneutral]\n1.

(a) EmoBench is built upon a\ndiverse content database. (c) The process of creating EmoBench involves expert template definition,\ndiverse template set generation, and instruction generation. (d) The proposed EmoLLM is designed\nto leverage the EmoBench for improving the multi-modal emotional understanding capabilities.\n3\nEmoBench\nAs a cornerstone of emotional tasks, we introduce EmoBench, a pioneering large-scale dataset\ncomprised of conversations focused on emotional dimensions. Initially, we explore the rationale and\nprovide a detailed definition of the tasks associated with EmoBench in Sec. 3.1. Following the task\ndefinition, we ensure a diverse and balanced representation of emotional content by sub-sampling\nfrom eight distinct datasets. We organize these samples into conversations using generative models\nand automated scripts, as detailed in Sec. 3.2.\n3.1\nData Preparation and Task Definition\nThe data in EmoBench is sourced from various emotion [12; 13; 11; 45; 46] and intention [23; 47; 48;\n49] datasets. As outlined in Tab. 1, we define two major categories of tasks: universal emotional tasks\nand emotional application tasks. For the former, which involves multi-modal emotion and intention\nunderstanding, we select well-known, data-rich works [12; 45; 11; 46; 23] from the community.\nFrom a classification perspective, LLMs are expected to choose the label that best matches the\ndata content. However, considering real-world applications where a predefined label list may not\nbe available, we also explore open-set understanding, where LLMs directly provide the predicted\ncategory without a predefined label list. For emotional application tasks, we identify sub-tasks with\nsignificant applications in the industry, particularly those frequently encountered or crucial in social\nmedia, such as humor [47], hate [48], and sarcasm [49] detection.\n3.2\nInstruction Construction\nWith the assistance of LLMs, data annotation has become increasingly streamlined. We adopt a similar\napproach and utilize a GPT-participated pipeline to establish a paradigm akin to visual (multimodal)\nquestion answering. For the Universal Emotion Tasks outlined in Sec. 3.1, we manually create a\nquestion template, e.g., \"Question: Question_base + [LABEL_SET]. <DATA> Answer: [LABEL]\".\nThe Question_base is derived from the diverse questions generated by GPT, such as: “Identify the\nonly emotion depicted in the given image from the following options”; [LABEL_SET] represents the\nlabel set of the current subtask, such as [anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise] in the emotion\nrecognition task; <DATA> is the multi-modal data placeholder; and [LABEL] corresponds to the\nground-truth label in the original sub-task dataset, reflecting the emotion category of the multi-modal\ndata.

(a) EmoLLM takes a user query and multimodal\ndata as input, which are processed by a LLM and modality-specific encoders, respectively. (b)\nThe Multi-perspective Visual Projection consists of various stages, each extracting features from\nvisual tokens and building a graph connecting cluster centers. The combined representations form a\ncomprehensive understanding of the emotional aspects.\n4\nMethodology\nIn this section, we provide a detailed overview of EmoLLM. We begin by describing the architecture\nof the model, then delve into each component of EmoLLM.\n4.1\nModel Overview\nWe present an overview of EmoLLM in this section, as shown in Fig. 3. There are three major\nmodules in EmoLLM as follows:\nModality Encoding: To incorporate additional modalities such as visual and audio data, we integrate\nextra modality encoders into EmoLLM. This enhancement enables our model to effectively handle\nmultiple modalities.\nMulti-perspective Visual Projection: To effectively capture diverse emotional cues from visual\ndata, we propose the MVP module. Unlike traditional methods that rely on a single perspective, MVP\nemploys a multifaceted approach, analyzing visual data from multiple viewpoints. By constructing a\ngraph-based representation of the relationships between object features, MVP enables EmoLLM to\nextract a rich set of emotionally relevant features.\nEmoPrompt Reasoning: EmoPrompt leverages the capabilities of GPT-4V [1] to generate accurate\nand contextually appropriate prompts. By providing GPT-4V with carefully curated data samples and\ntheir corresponding ground truth labels, EmoPrompt facilitates a reliable Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nprocess. This CoT process serves as a blueprint for EmoLLM’s reasoning, ensuring that it stays on\ntrack and arrives at emotionally coherent conclusions.\n4.2\nModality Encoding\nWe design the corresponding modal encoding module for common modalities in emotional tasks,\nincluding the following three parts:\nVisual Modality Encoding: To encode visual information, including images and video frames, we\nemploy the CLIP-VIT-L\/14 model proposed by Radford et al. [34]. CLIP is a novel framework that\nlearns directly from unprocessed textual data related to images, enabling it to exploit a significantly\nwider range of supervision. The details of the visual encoding process are described in Sec. 4.3.\nAudio Modality Encoding: For encoding audio signals and extracting meaningful representations\nfrom audio data, we utilize the WHISPER-BASE model introduced by Radford et al. [36]. WHISPER\nis a multilingual speech recognition model trained on a vast audio dataset with weak supervision,\nmaking it well-suited for capturing rich information from audio inputs.\n5\nTextual Modality Encoding: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically pre-trained on massive\ntext corpora, enabling instruction-tuned LLMs to effectively process textual information. In EmoLLM,\nwe use LLaMA2-7B [2] as the foundation model for textual modality encoding, leveraging its strong\nlanguage understanding capabilities.\nGiven a video xv ∈RLv×dv, an image xi ∈RLi×di, an audio signal xa ∈RLa×da, and a user input\ntext xt ∈RLt×dt, we employ pre-trained models to encode the multimodal features. Specifically,\nwe use the Multi-perspective Visual Projection (MVP) module, to encode the visual features. For\nthe audio signal, we first apply the WHISPER model and then use a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to\ntransform them into the desired dimension. The encoding process can be formulated as follows:\nhi = MVP (xi) , hv = MVP (xv) , ha = MLP(WHISPER (xa)),\n(1)\nwhere hi ∈RLi×dh,hv ∈RLv×dh and ha ∈RLa×dh denote the encoded image, video, and audio\nfeatures, respectively. The dimension of the modality-specific features is represented by dh\n4.3\nMulti-perspective Visual Projection\nIn this section, we introduce Multi-perspective Visual Projections designed for emotional tasks.\nWe consider two important aspects of multimodal emotional tasks: (1) mining objective object\ninformation in multimodal data, which we call content-based perspective, and (2) observing the\nconnections and relationships between objects, which we refer to as relation-based perspective.\nTo better understand the emotional aspects highlighted in the data, we believe that MLLMs should\nconsider both the content-based and relation-based perspectives to deepen their understanding of\nemotional factors.\nGiven an input image (or a frame of video) xi, we adopt the vision encoder of CLIP [34] to extract the\noriginal visual tokens Z = {zi}L\ni=1, where L is the number of visual tokens. Following Jin et al. [37],\nwe then utilize DPC-KNN [50], a k-nearest neighbor-based density peaks clustering algorithm, to\ncluster the visual tokens and obtain the content-based representation. The local density ρi and distance\nindex δi of each token zi are computed as follows:\nρi = exp\n\u0000−1\nK\nX\nzk∈KNN(zi,Z)\n∥zk −zi∥2\u0001\n, δi\n=\n\n\n\nmin\nj:ρj>ρi ∥zj −zi∥2,\nif ∃j s.t. ρj > ρi,\nmax\nj\n∥zj −zi∥2,\notherwise,\n(2)\nwhere KNN(zi, Z) denotes the K-nearest neighbors of zi in Z after removing zi. Tokens with\nrelatively high ρi × δi are identified as cluster centers, and other tokens are allocated to their nearest\ncluster center based on Euclidean distances. The average token within each cluster represents the\ncorresponding cluster z′\ni.\nTo obtain the relation-based representation, we construct a graph G = (V, E) using the cluster centers.\nEach cluster center z′i becomes a node vi ∈V, with the feature of each cluster center used as the\nnode’s value. To determine the edge weights, we first calculate the Euclidean distance between all\ncluster centers:\ndij = ∥z′\ni −z′\nj∥2.\n(3)\nWe then normalize the distances to the range [0, 1] using min-max normalization:\n˜dij =\ndij −mini,j(dij)\nmaxi,j(dij) −mini,j(dij).\n(4)\nTo determine the adjacency matrix A, we set a threshold τ and consider nodes i and j as adjacent if\ntheir normalized distance ˜dij is less than or equal to τ:\nAij =\n\u001a1,\nif ˜dij ≤τ,\n0,\notherwise.\n(5)\nWe apply a multi-layer graph convolutional network (GCN) [51] to the constructed graph. The graph\nconvolution operation at layer l can be formulated as:\nH(l+1) = σ( ˆD\n−1\n2 ˆA ˆD\n−1\n2 H(l)W (l)),\n(6)\nwhere ˆA = A + I is the adjacency matrix with added self-connections, ˆD is the degree matrix of\nˆA, H(l) is the feature matrix at layer l, W (l) is the trainable weight matrix at layer l, and σ is the\n6\nEmoBench\n1.

The output of the last layer H(m) serves as the relation-based representation,\nwhere m is the number of layers.\nFor a video with the m-th frame Zm = {zm\ni }L\ni=1, following [37], we apply mean-pooling over all\ntokens to obtain the frame-level representation f m:\nf m = 1\nL\nL\nX\ni=1\nzm\ni .\n(7)\nWe then use DPC-KNN [50; 37] to cluster the frames and identify critical events. The set of visual\ntokens within the n-th event F n is denoted as ˜Zn = {zm\ni |m ∈F n, i ∈1, 2, ..., L}. To make\nthe visual tokens expand over frames within each event, we adjust the local density and distance\nindex calculations according to eq. (2). The expanded visual tokens are concatenated together in\norder of events to ensure temporal understanding. To provide multi-scale visual features, we adopt\na three-step aggregation process for each input image or video. The outputs from each merging\nstep are concatenated and transformed using a trainable projection matrix W to obtain the content-\nbased representation Rcontent. The relation-based representation Rrelation is obtained from the\naggregation of the GCN output in each stage H(m). The final feature representation hi is the linear\ncombination of the content-based and relation-based representations with a coefficient α:\nhi = (α × Rcontent) ⊕Rrelation.\n(8)\nBy integrating content-based and relation-based representations, MVP aims to enhance the ability\nof model to reason about the relationships between visual elements and improve its performance\non downstream emotional tasks. The resulting feature representation provides a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the visual input, incorporating both local and global relationships.\n4.4\nEmoPrompt Reasoning\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) [8] is a popular and efficient technique for enhancing the reasoning power\nof LLMs without fine-tuning. It involves adding step-by-step reasoning instructions to the user’s\nprompt, guiding the LLM through a logical thought process. Given the delicate and unintuitive nature\nof emotional tasks, this kind of reasoning is crucial for accurate emotion understanding.\nFor emotional tasks, we first design a task-specific CoT as a baseline. Drawing inspiration from how\nhumans identify emotions in images and videos, we observe that people often focus on the content of\nobjects first, such as facial expressions, atmospheres, and other visual cues. Intuitively, we guide the\nMLLM to reason about the objective content in the data first, and then reason about the emotional\ntask based on the obtained conclusion combined with the data. The advantage of this approach is that\nit guides the observation of LLM, leading to more robust reasoning.\nHowever, this step-by-step thinking heavily depends on the observations made in the first step. If the\nLLM hallucinates or generates inaccurate observations during the initial stage, it can greatly affect\nthe judgment of the emotional task. To address this issue, we propose EmoPrompt, which aims to\nprovide correct guidance for the reasoning process.\nTo achieve this goal, we first collect data on a subset of emotional tasks along with their corresponding\nground truth labels. By presenting both the “question” (emotion data) and “answer” (ground truth\nlabel) to GPT-4V, we obtain objective-to-subjective reasoning in the correct direction, as shown in\nFig. 4. This ensures the correctness of the step-by-step reasoning process. Using this methodology,\n7\nTable 2: Comparison of the emotional ability between baseline MLLMs and our EmoLLM, on\nEmoBench-test set.\nMethods\nEmoBench Testing (30K)\nEmo-C\nEmo-O\nIntention\nHate\nHumor\nSarcasm\nOverall\nVicuna [52]\nzero-shot\n29.21\n21.55\n17.48\n45.39\n49.68\n55.23\n28.63\nChatUniVi [37]\nfine-tune\n47.62\n39.26\n57.85\n63.03\n63.85\n77.87\n46.66\nMacawLLM [38] fine-tune\n42.42\n31.05\n52.91\n57.54\n55.60\n71.75\n40.28\nOneLLM [39]\nfine-tune\n51.16\n40.30\n56.95\n59.01\n60.89\n73.93\n48.20\nEmoLLM\nfine-tune\n64.06\n52.58\n73.99\n67.43\n75.69\n86.67\n60.36\nwe collect hundreds of examples of reasoning for each emotional task. These examples serve as\ndemonstrations of correct reasoning during the EmoLLM reasoning process.\nBy incorporating EmoPrompt, we guide EmoLLM to follow a correct reasoning path, mitigating\nthe impact of potential hallucinations or inaccuracies in the initial observation stage. This approach\nenhances the ability of LLMs to accurately understand and interpret emotions in multimodal data.\n5\nExperiments\n5.1\nExperimental Setup\nWe adopt CLIP (ViT-L\/14) [34] and WHISPER [36] as the visual and acoustic encoders, respectively.\nFor the language foundation model, we choose the Vicuna-v1.5 model [52], which consists of 7B\nparameters. During the emotional fine-tuning stage, we utilize the data from EmoBench. EmoLLM\nis trained for 5 epochs with a batch size of 16, using the AdamW [53; 54] optimizer with a cosine\nlearning rate schedule. The learning rate is set to 2e-5, and the warmup rate is 0.03. All input images\nor frames are resized to 224 × 224. Training one epoch on 4 × RTX 4090 GPUs takes approximately\n5 hours using LoRA [55]. Hyperparameters are determined on the validation set, and final results are\nobtained on the test set. Each result is the average of three runs with various random seeds.\n5.2\nMain Results\nTable 3: Comparison of the emotional abil-\nity between SOTA MLLMs and EmoLLM.\nMethod\n#Param\nEmo-C\nEmo-O\nGPT-4V\n∼1012\n57.90\n45.10\nGemini1.0\n∼1011\n45.47\n44.83\nGemini1.5\n∼1011\n45.47\n44.83\nEmoLLM\n∼1010\n75.03\n67.14\nTo quantitatively measure the emotional capability of\nEmoLLM, we evaluate its performance on six sub-tasks\nfrom EmoBench, including close-set and open-set emo-\ntion classification, intention recognition, and three spe-\ncial emotional application tasks. As shown in Tab. 2,\nEmoLLM achieves superior performance compared to\nbaselines with the same 7B parameter scale, demon-\nstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.\nWe also compare the emotional understanding abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs on an emotion\nsub-test set. Considering that some MLLMs do not support video and audio, we take a subset of\npure images from EmoBench test set. It contains 6 emotion categories with hundreds of images in\neach category. As presented in Tab. 3, EmoLLM outperforms GPT-4V, Gemini-1.0, and Gemini-1.5\non both close-set (Emo-C) and open-set (Emo-O) emotion classification tasks while maintaining a\nsmaller parameter count.\n5.3\nAblation Studies\nWe conduct ablation studies to explore the key design choices in EmoLLM. All experiments are\nconducted on the Emo-C part of EmoBench test set, with other settings unchanged unless specified.\nMulti-perspective Visual Projection We investigate the impact of the hyperparameter τ in the\nMulti-perspective Visual Projection module by varying its value from 0.05 to 0.5. As shown in Fig. 5\n(left), performance of EmoLLM is sensitive to the choice of τ, with the highest accuracy of 64.06%\nachieved when τ is set to 0.1. The accuracy tends to decline as τ increases, indicating that a suitable\nvalue of τ is beneficial for emotional understanding capabilities of EmoLLM.\nQuantity Effects in EmoPrompt To examine the impact of the number of EmoPrompts on the\nperformance of EmoLLM, we vary the number of prompts from 100 to 1000 and evaluate the\n8\nTable 4: Various training strategies affect emotional understanding ability of LLMs. Training on\ntraditional tasks first and then emotional tasks (sequential) leads to the best results.\nTraining Strategy\nEmo-C\nEmo-O\nIntention\nHate\nHumor\nSarcasm\nOverall\nemo\n61.65\n47.40\n67.71\n62.44\n70.82\n80.22\n56.24\nmix\n63.05+1.40\n49.32+1.92\n73.54+5.83\n65.90+3.46\n67.65-3.17\n83.74+3.52\n58.11+1.87\nsequential\n64.06+2.41\n52.58+5.18\n73.99+6.28\n67.43+4.99\n75.69+4.87\n86.67+6.45\n60.36+4.12\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\n1000\nNumber of EmoPrompts\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n66\nEmo-C Accuracy\n61.37\n62.15\n63.13\n63.41\n63.91 63.89 63.84\n64.06 63.91\nAccuracy\nData Points\n60\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nHyperparameter \n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n66\nEmo-C Accuracy\n61.70\n64.06\n63.24\n63.56\n62.25\n62.48\nAccuracy\nData Points\nFigure 5: Hyperparameter ablation in Multi-perspective Visual Projection and EmoPrompts.\nEmoLLM has the best performance when τ is 0.1.

As depicted in Fig. 5 (right), increasing the number of EmoPrompts generally\nleads to improved performance, with the peak accuracy of 64.06% achieved when all prompts are\nused. This finding highlights the importance of utilizing a diverse set of prompts to enhance the\nemotional reasoning ability of LLMs. However, the performance gains diminish as the number\nof prompts exceeds 600, suggesting an optimal range for balancing computational efficiency and\nemotional understanding.\nEffect of the Tuning Strategy We investigate whether different objective and affective training\nsequences affect the emotional understanding ability of LLMs. In Tab. 4, we compare the performance\nof three training strategies: emo (training with only EmoBench), mix (training with objective fine-\ntuned data mixed with EmoBench), and sequential (fine-tuning with objective data first and then\nwith emotional task). The results suggest that sequential training substantially benefits emotional\nunderstanding. A possible explanation is that it simulates the way humans learn, starting with\neasy tasks and progressing to more difficult ones, while also moving from general knowledge to\ndomain-specific knowledge.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this work, we introduce EmoBench, a comprehensive benchmark for enhancing and evaluating the\nemotional understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), and propose\nEmoLLM, a novel model incorporating Multi-perspective Visual Projection and EmoPrompt tech-\nniques. Through extensive experiments on EmoBench, we demonstrated substantial improvements of\nEmoLLM over baselines, with an average improvement of 12.1% across multiple foundation models.\nLimitations. One notable limitation is that the answers to the instructions in EmoBench may lack\ndiversity since they were generated by GPT-4 and automated scripts rather than collected from human\nannotators. Maybe the future of work combining automation with manual labeling is a promising\ndirection. Another limitation is the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs, such as hallucination and\nsensitivity to prompts, which may affect the performance of EmoLLM.\nFuture Work. Despite these limitations, we believe our work takes a significant step towards\nenabling MLLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of complex emotions in multimodal data,\npaving the way for emotionally intelligent AI systems. Future work could focus on addressing the\nlimitations mentioned above, such as increasing the diversity of EmoBench through a combination of\nautomated and manual labeling, and mitigating the vulnerabilities of LLMs. Furthermore, exploring\nthe application of emotionally intelligent AI systems in real-world scenarios and evaluating their\nimpact on user experience and well-being could be valuable avenues for future research.\n9","pdf_path":"tools\/arxiv_tools\/asset\/pdf\/\/EmoLLM: Multimodal Emotional Understanding Meets Large Language Models.pdf","query_prompt":"### 任务\n你是一个人工智能领域的专家，你能够快速阅读arxiv上的各种AI前沿论文和相关博客，进而完美地回答学生的问题。\n现在请你阅读以下论文及博客，并回答学生的问题。\n\n### 论文信息\n###  1. 论文标题\n```\nEmoLLM: Multimodal Emotional Understanding Meets Large Language Models\n```\n#### 2. 论文摘要\n```\nMulti-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable\nperformance on objective multimodal perception tasks, but their ability to\ninterpret subjective, emotionally nuanced multimodal content remains largely\nunexplored.

Dick’s seminal\nnovel underscores a fundamental divide between artificial intelligence and humanity – the capacity for\ngenuine emotion. In our modern era, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]\nhave achieved remarkable performance, even surpassing human capabilities in domains such as\nperception and cognition. However, when it comes to the realm of emotions, state-of-the-art MLLMs\nappear to be lacking in their ability to accurately interpret and respond to emotional cues. While\nexisting MLLMs can generate basic responses to human queries regarding emotional aspects, the\naccuracy of their responses remains unsatisfactory, especially in nuanced categories such as fear and\nanger (Fig. 1(b)). Moreover, even LLMs that have been employed for text-based emotional analysis\noften fall short when confronted with the complexities of multimodal emotional tasks, which require\nthe integration of visual, auditory, and textual cues. A primary factor contributing to this limitation is\nthe scarcity of comprehensive emotional datasets for training MLLMs, as publicly available datasets\ngenerally focus on objective visual abilities [7]. This gap not only mirrors the philosophical questions\nraised by Dick’s narrative but also motivates us to explore the vast, uncharted territories of emotional\nintelligence within MLLMs.\n*Corresponding Author\narXiv:2406.16442v2  [cs.CV]  29 Jun 2024\nEmotion Understanding \nWhat is the emotion \nin this picture?\nThe emotion in the \nimage is exciting\nEmotional\nUniversal \nTasks\nEmotional \nApplication\nTasks\nUser Query\nThe image conveys a \nsense of Happy\na.

(c) Overview of the diverse tasks in EmoBench, including emotional\nuniversal tasks, emotional application tasks (hate, sarcasm, and humor detection).\nTo bridge this gap, we propose EmoBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to serve two critical\nfunctions: providing a rich source of training materials to enhance the performance of MLLMs and\nevaluating their emotional understanding capabilities. EmoBench encompasses a diverse range of\ntasks (Fig. 1), which we categorize into Universal Emotional Tasks and Emotional Application Tasks.\nUniversal Emotional Tasks include multimodal emotion recognition and intent understanding, both\nrepresented as a classification paradigm. Emotional Application Tasks, on the other hand, focus on\nspecific challenges in social media applications, such as Hate, Sarcasm, and Humor Detection. To\nconstruct EmoBench, we first collected a diverse dataset for each subtask, as illustrated in Tab. 1.\nSubsequently, we employed GPT-4 [1] to generate a wide array of question templates for each subtask,\nultimately compiling a dataset of approximately 287,000 multimodal instructions. By offering a\nlarge-scale, diverse, and carefully curated dataset, EmoBench enables rigorous enhancement and\nevaluation of the emotional understanding capabilities of MLLMs.\nWith our proposed EmoBench, existing MLLMs can be empowered with better emotional understand-\ning capabilities with downstream fine-tuning. Current MLLMs typically follow a two-step process:\nmodality projection and LLM reasoning. However, these models still struggle to effectively capture\nand reason about the complex and nuanced emotions present in multimodal data. To address this chal-\nlenge, we propose EmoLLM, a novel model that incorporates two key techniques: Multi-perspective\nVisual Projection and EmoPrompt. Multi-perspective Visual Projection captures diverse emotional\ncues by considering multiple viewpoints. Specifically, we use the features of objects in different\nfeature maps as content information and construct the objects and their relationships as graph-based\nrelational information. By jointly mining these two aspects of information, we can extract features\nthat are more suitable for emotional tasks.\nIn the reasoning stage, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [8] is a common and effective method. Inspired by\nCoT, we first let EmoLLM observe objects in multimedia data and then infer emotions based on these\nobservations. However, a significant problem arises, i.e., the correctness of the first-stage observations\ndetermines the accuracy of the final inference. To mitigate this issue, EmoPrompt incorporates\nspecific examples stored for the current task. To ensure the correctness of these examples, we present\nGPT-4V with data samples and ground truth labels to obtain an accurate CoT process. Whenever a\nprompt is required, EmoPrompt selects one such example to guide the reasoning process.\nWe summarize our contributions as follows:\n• We introduce EmoBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to enhance and evaluate the\nemotional understanding capabilities of MLLMs across a diverse range of tasks, providing a\nlarge-scale dataset of ~287k instructions.\n• We propose EmoLLM, which incorporates Multi-perspective Visual Projection to capture\ndiverse emotional cues and EmoPrompt to guide the reasoning process.\n• We conduct extensive experiments on the EmoBench benchmark, demonstrating that\nEmoLLM achieves substantial improvements over baseline models, with an average im-\nprovement of 12.1% across multiple foundation models.\n2\nTable 1: The statistics of various data sources in EmoBench.\nCategory\nSub-task\nDataset\nModality\nSampled Size (k)\nq\n2\n5\n4\nTrain\nVal & Test\nUniversal\nEmotional\nTasks\nEmotion\nEmotic [12; 13]\n✗\n✓\n✗\n✗\n16.2\n6.4\nEmotion\nCaer-S [45]\n✗\n✓\n✗\n✗\n42.0\n21.0\nEmotion\nMeld [11]\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✓\n11.1\n2.6\nEmotion\nEmotion_6 [46]\n✗\n✓\n✗\n✗\n1.3\n0.6\nIntention\nMintRec [23]\n✗\n✓\n✗\n✗\n1.7\n0.4\nEmotional\nApplication\nTasks\nHumor\nSMILE [47]\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✓\n8.6\n1.0\nHate\nMMHS [48]\n✓\n✓\n✗\n✗\n139.8\n10\nSarcasm\nMMSD [49]\n✓\n✗\n✓\n✓\n22.2\n2.4\n2\nRelated Works\n2.1\nMulti-modality Emotional Tasks and Methods\nMultimodal emotion recognition, which analyzes feelings through speech, text, and visual cues,\nhas been a growing area of research. Early datasets like IEMOCAP [9] provide vital audiovisual\ninteraction data but are limited by their focus on scripted events and lack of speaker diversity.\nSubsequent datasets, such as CMU-MOSEI [10] and MELD [11], address these limitations by\noffering more naturalistic expressions from videos and television shows. Emotic [12; 13] and\nGoEmotions [14] further expand the scope of resources for emotion recognition. In the related field of\nintention understanding, contemporary datasets like CLINC150 [15], HWU64 [16], Intentonomy [17],\nSnips [18], MDID [19], MSED [20], and BANKING77 [21] are derived from a diverse range of\nsources, including online forums and social media to explore the user intent [22]. The MIntRec\ndataset [23] takes a unique approach by utilizing TV series clips to capture the complex intentions\nportrayed by actors.\nBuilding upon these datasets, numerous methods [24; 25; 26] have been proposed to advance the field\nof multimodal emotion recognition. Lee et al. [27] introduce the Multimodal Transformer (MulT),\nwhich employs the vanilla Transformer [28] architecture and directional cross-modal attention to learn\neffective multimodal language representations. Hazarika et al. [29] propose Modality-Invariant and\n-Specific Representations (MISA), which differentiates modality features into invariant and specific\nsubspaces to aid in fusion and prediction. Yang et al. [30] introduce MFSA, a transformer-based\nmodel that leverages adversarial learning to create modality-specific and -agnostic representations for\nsentiment recognition. Recently, Zhang et al. [31] attempted to use GPT [1] to convert multimodal\nemotion tasks into text emotion recognition. However, this approach relies on pre-processing by an\nMLLM and is not suitable for practical applications.\n2.2\nMulti-modality Large Language Models\nLarge language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 [1], Gemini-Pro [32], and LLaVA [33], have\ndemonstrated remarkable language abilities in capturing general knowledge. By incorporating visual\nand audio inputs into LLMs using techniques like CLIP [34] and additional adapting modules [35;\n36], multi-modality large language models (MLLMs) [37; 38; 39] have been developed to tackle\na variety of multi-modal tasks. These tasks include image captioning [40; 41], visual question\nanswering (VQA) [42; 43], and other language-related capabilities [44]. However, as revealed by our\nprevious research (Fig. 1 b), the emotional understanding abilities of MLLMs remain unsatisfactory,\nparticularly when dealing with complex emotions such as anger and fear, or emotional categories that\nrequire reasoning. We attribute this limitation primarily to the lack of relevant data and specialized\nmodels. To address this issue, we introduce EmoBench, the first emotional instruction tuning dataset\ndesigned to enhance the emotional understanding capabilities of various MLLMs and enable them to\nbetter navigate the realm of emotional comprehension.\n3\n(a) Collect Emotional Data (With label)\nIn-the-wild\nTV \/ movie\nSample\nClean\n287k Content \nDatabase\n(b) Define Emotional Tasks and Prompts\nEmotional\nUniversal  \nTasks\nEmotional \nApplication\nTasks\nTaxonomy\n(c) Diverse Instruction Generation\nChoose one emotional category that best \nmatches the given image from these choices: \n[anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, \nneutral]\n1.

(d) The proposed EmoLLM is designed\nto leverage the EmoBench for improving the multi-modal emotional understanding capabilities.\n3\nEmoBench\nAs a cornerstone of emotional tasks, we introduce EmoBench, a pioneering large-scale dataset\ncomprised of conversations focused on emotional dimensions. Initially, we explore the rationale and\nprovide a detailed definition of the tasks associated with EmoBench in Sec. 3.1. Following the task\ndefinition, we ensure a diverse and balanced representation of emotional content by sub-sampling\nfrom eight distinct datasets. We organize these samples into conversations using generative models\nand automated scripts, as detailed in Sec. 3.2.\n3.1\nData Preparation and Task Definition\nThe data in EmoBench is sourced from various emotion [12; 13; 11; 45; 46] and intention [23; 47; 48;\n49] datasets. As outlined in Tab. 1, we define two major categories of tasks: universal emotional tasks\nand emotional application tasks. For the former, which involves multi-modal emotion and intention\nunderstanding, we select well-known, data-rich works [12; 45; 11; 46; 23] from the community.\nFrom a classification perspective, LLMs are expected to choose the label that best matches the\ndata content. However, considering real-world applications where a predefined label list may not\nbe available, we also explore open-set understanding, where LLMs directly provide the predicted\ncategory without a predefined label list. For emotional application tasks, we identify sub-tasks with\nsignificant applications in the industry, particularly those frequently encountered or crucial in social\nmedia, such as humor [47], hate [48], and sarcasm [49] detection.\n3.2\nInstruction Construction\nWith the assistance of LLMs, data annotation has become increasingly streamlined. We adopt a similar\napproach and utilize a GPT-participated pipeline to establish a paradigm akin to visual (multimodal)\nquestion answering. For the Universal Emotion Tasks outlined in Sec. 3.1, we manually create a\nquestion template, e.g., \"Question: Question_base + [LABEL_SET]. <DATA> Answer: [LABEL]\".\nThe Question_base is derived from the diverse questions generated by GPT, such as: “Identify the\nonly emotion depicted in the given image from the following options”; [LABEL_SET] represents the\nlabel set of the current subtask, such as [anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise] in the emotion\nrecognition task; <DATA> is the multi-modal data placeholder; and [LABEL] corresponds to the\nground-truth label in the original sub-task dataset, reflecting the emotion category of the multi-modal\ndata. For Emotional Application Subtasks, we modify the question format to a binary choice, e.g.,\n“Does the given multi-modal data contain sarcasm? Please answer Yes or No”.\n4\nUser Query\nVideo\nVideo\nEncoder\n…\nLarge Language Model\nEmoLLM \nResponse\nImage\nImage\nEncoder\n…\na. Overview of EmoLLM\nb.

(a) EmoLLM takes a user query and multimodal\ndata as input, which are processed by a LLM and modality-specific encoders, respectively. (b)\nThe Multi-perspective Visual Projection consists of various stages, each extracting features from\nvisual tokens and building a graph connecting cluster centers. The combined representations form a\ncomprehensive understanding of the emotional aspects.\n4\nMethodology\nIn this section, we provide a detailed overview of EmoLLM. We begin by describing the architecture\nof the model, then delve into each component of EmoLLM.\n4.1\nModel Overview\nWe present an overview of EmoLLM in this section, as shown in Fig. 3. There are three major\nmodules in EmoLLM as follows:\nModality Encoding: To incorporate additional modalities such as visual and audio data, we integrate\nextra modality encoders into EmoLLM. This enhancement enables our model to effectively handle\nmultiple modalities.\nMulti-perspective Visual Projection: To effectively capture diverse emotional cues from visual\ndata, we propose the MVP module. Unlike traditional methods that rely on a single perspective, MVP\nemploys a multifaceted approach, analyzing visual data from multiple viewpoints. By constructing a\ngraph-based representation of the relationships between object features, MVP enables EmoLLM to\nextract a rich set of emotionally relevant features.\nEmoPrompt Reasoning: EmoPrompt leverages the capabilities of GPT-4V [1] to generate accurate\nand contextually appropriate prompts. By providing GPT-4V with carefully curated data samples and\ntheir corresponding ground truth labels, EmoPrompt facilitates a reliable Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nprocess. This CoT process serves as a blueprint for EmoLLM’s reasoning, ensuring that it stays on\ntrack and arrives at emotionally coherent conclusions.\n4.2\nModality Encoding\nWe design the corresponding modal encoding module for common modalities in emotional tasks,\nincluding the following three parts:\nVisual Modality Encoding: To encode visual information, including images and video frames, we\nemploy the CLIP-VIT-L\/14 model proposed by Radford et al. [34]. CLIP is a novel framework that\nlearns directly from unprocessed textual data related to images, enabling it to exploit a significantly\nwider range of supervision. The details of the visual encoding process are described in Sec. 4.3.\nAudio Modality Encoding: For encoding audio signals and extracting meaningful representations\nfrom audio data, we utilize the WHISPER-BASE model introduced by Radford et al. [36]. WHISPER\nis a multilingual speech recognition model trained on a vast audio dataset with weak supervision,\nmaking it well-suited for capturing rich information from audio inputs.\n5\nTextual Modality Encoding: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically pre-trained on massive\ntext corpora, enabling instruction-tuned LLMs to effectively process textual information. In EmoLLM,\nwe use LLaMA2-7B [2] as the foundation model for textual modality encoding, leveraging its strong\nlanguage understanding capabilities.\nGiven a video xv ∈RLv×dv, an image xi ∈RLi×di, an audio signal xa ∈RLa×da, and a user input\ntext xt ∈RLt×dt, we employ pre-trained models to encode the multimodal features. Specifically,\nwe use the Multi-perspective Visual Projection (MVP) module, to encode the visual features. For\nthe audio signal, we first apply the WHISPER model and then use a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to\ntransform them into the desired dimension. The encoding process can be formulated as follows:\nhi = MVP (xi) , hv = MVP (xv) , ha = MLP(WHISPER (xa)),\n(1)\nwhere hi ∈RLi×dh,hv ∈RLv×dh and ha ∈RLa×dh denote the encoded image, video, and audio\nfeatures, respectively. The dimension of the modality-specific features is represented by dh\n4.3\nMulti-perspective Visual Projection\nIn this section, we introduce Multi-perspective Visual Projections designed for emotional tasks.\nWe consider two important aspects of multimodal emotional tasks: (1) mining objective object\ninformation in multimodal data, which we call content-based perspective, and (2) observing the\nconnections and relationships between objects, which we refer to as relation-based perspective.\nTo better understand the emotional aspects highlighted in the data, we believe that MLLMs should\nconsider both the content-based and relation-based perspectives to deepen their understanding of\nemotional factors.\nGiven an input image (or a frame of video) xi, we adopt the vision encoder of CLIP [34] to extract the\noriginal visual tokens Z = {zi}L\ni=1, where L is the number of visual tokens. Following Jin et al. [37],\nwe then utilize DPC-KNN [50], a k-nearest neighbor-based density peaks clustering algorithm, to\ncluster the visual tokens and obtain the content-based representation. The local density ρi and distance\nindex δi of each token zi are computed as follows:\nρi = exp\n\u0000−1\nK\nX\nzk∈KNN(zi,Z)\n∥zk −zi∥2\u0001\n, δi\n=\n\n\n\nmin\nj:ρj>ρi ∥zj −zi∥2,\nif ∃j s.t. ρj > ρi,\nmax\nj\n∥zj −zi∥2,\notherwise,\n(2)\nwhere KNN(zi, Z) denotes the K-nearest neighbors of zi in Z after removing zi. Tokens with\nrelatively high ρi × δi are identified as cluster centers, and other tokens are allocated to their nearest\ncluster center based on Euclidean distances. The average token within each cluster represents the\ncorresponding cluster z′\ni.\nTo obtain the relation-based representation, we construct a graph G = (V, E) using the cluster centers.\nEach cluster center z′i becomes a node vi ∈V, with the feature of each cluster center used as the\nnode’s value. To determine the edge weights, we first calculate the Euclidean distance between all\ncluster centers:\ndij = ∥z′\ni −z′\nj∥2.\n(3)\nWe then normalize the distances to the range [0, 1] using min-max normalization:\n˜dij =\ndij −mini,j(dij)\nmaxi,j(dij) −mini,j(dij).\n(4)\nTo determine the adjacency matrix A, we set a threshold τ and consider nodes i and j as adjacent if\ntheir normalized distance ˜dij is less than or equal to τ:\nAij =\n\u001a1,\nif ˜dij ≤τ,\n0,\notherwise.\n(5)\nWe apply a multi-layer graph convolutional network (GCN) [51] to the constructed graph. The graph\nconvolution operation at layer l can be formulated as:\nH(l+1) = σ( ˆD\n−1\n2 ˆA ˆD\n−1\n2 H(l)W (l)),\n(6)\nwhere ˆA = A + I is the adjacency matrix with added self-connections, ˆD is the degree matrix of\nˆA, H(l) is the feature matrix at layer l, W (l) is the trainable weight matrix at layer l, and σ is the\n6\nEmoBench\n1.

The output of the last layer H(m) serves as the relation-based representation,\nwhere m is the number of layers.\nFor a video with the m-th frame Zm = {zm\ni }L\ni=1, following [37], we apply mean-pooling over all\ntokens to obtain the frame-level representation f m:\nf m = 1\nL\nL\nX\ni=1\nzm\ni .\n(7)\nWe then use DPC-KNN [50; 37] to cluster the frames and identify critical events. The set of visual\ntokens within the n-th event F n is denoted as ˜Zn = {zm\ni |m ∈F n, i ∈1, 2, ..., L}. To make\nthe visual tokens expand over frames within each event, we adjust the local density and distance\nindex calculations according to eq. (2). The expanded visual tokens are concatenated together in\norder of events to ensure temporal understanding. To provide multi-scale visual features, we adopt\na three-step aggregation process for each input image or video. The outputs from each merging\nstep are concatenated and transformed using a trainable projection matrix W to obtain the content-\nbased representation Rcontent. The relation-based representation Rrelation is obtained from the\naggregation of the GCN output in each stage H(m). The final feature representation hi is the linear\ncombination of the content-based and relation-based representations with a coefficient α:\nhi = (α × Rcontent) ⊕Rrelation.\n(8)\nBy integrating content-based and relation-based representations, MVP aims to enhance the ability\nof model to reason about the relationships between visual elements and improve its performance\non downstream emotional tasks. The resulting feature representation provides a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the visual input, incorporating both local and global relationships.\n4.4\nEmoPrompt Reasoning\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) [8] is a popular and efficient technique for enhancing the reasoning power\nof LLMs without fine-tuning. It involves adding step-by-step reasoning instructions to the user’s\nprompt, guiding the LLM through a logical thought process. Given the delicate and unintuitive nature\nof emotional tasks, this kind of reasoning is crucial for accurate emotion understanding.\nFor emotional tasks, we first design a task-specific CoT as a baseline. Drawing inspiration from how\nhumans identify emotions in images and videos, we observe that people often focus on the content of\nobjects first, such as facial expressions, atmospheres, and other visual cues. Intuitively, we guide the\nMLLM to reason about the objective content in the data first, and then reason about the emotional\ntask based on the obtained conclusion combined with the data. The advantage of this approach is that\nit guides the observation of LLM, leading to more robust reasoning.\nHowever, this step-by-step thinking heavily depends on the observations made in the first step. If the\nLLM hallucinates or generates inaccurate observations during the initial stage, it can greatly affect\nthe judgment of the emotional task. To address this issue, we propose EmoPrompt, which aims to\nprovide correct guidance for the reasoning process.\nTo achieve this goal, we first collect data on a subset of emotional tasks along with their corresponding\nground truth labels. By presenting both the “question” (emotion data) and “answer” (ground truth\nlabel) to GPT-4V, we obtain objective-to-subjective reasoning in the correct direction, as shown in\nFig. 4. This ensures the correctness of the step-by-step reasoning process. Using this methodology,\n7\nTable 2: Comparison of the emotional ability between baseline MLLMs and our EmoLLM, on\nEmoBench-test set.\nMethods\nEmoBench Testing (30K)\nEmo-C\nEmo-O\nIntention\nHate\nHumor\nSarcasm\nOverall\nVicuna [52]\nzero-shot\n29.21\n21.55\n17.48\n45.39\n49.68\n55.23\n28.63\nChatUniVi [37]\nfine-tune\n47.62\n39.26\n57.85\n63.03\n63.85\n77.87\n46.66\nMacawLLM [38] fine-tune\n42.42\n31.05\n52.91\n57.54\n55.60\n71.75\n40.28\nOneLLM [39]\nfine-tune\n51.16\n40.30\n56.95\n59.01\n60.89\n73.93\n48.20\nEmoLLM\nfine-tune\n64.06\n52.58\n73.99\n67.43\n75.69\n86.67\n60.36\nwe collect hundreds of examples of reasoning for each emotional task. These examples serve as\ndemonstrations of correct reasoning during the EmoLLM reasoning process.\nBy incorporating EmoPrompt, we guide EmoLLM to follow a correct reasoning path, mitigating\nthe impact of potential hallucinations or inaccuracies in the initial observation stage. This approach\nenhances the ability of LLMs to accurately understand and interpret emotions in multimodal data.\n5\nExperiments\n5.1\nExperimental Setup\nWe adopt CLIP (ViT-L\/14) [34] and WHISPER [36] as the visual and acoustic encoders, respectively.\nFor the language foundation model, we choose the Vicuna-v1.5 model [52], which consists of 7B\nparameters. During the emotional fine-tuning stage, we utilize the data from EmoBench. EmoLLM\nis trained for 5 epochs with a batch size of 16, using the AdamW [53; 54] optimizer with a cosine\nlearning rate schedule. The learning rate is set to 2e-5, and the warmup rate is 0.03. All input images\nor frames are resized to 224 × 224. Training one epoch on 4 × RTX 4090 GPUs takes approximately\n5 hours using LoRA [55]. Hyperparameters are determined on the validation set, and final results are\nobtained on the test set. Each result is the average of three runs with various random seeds.\n5.2\nMain Results\nTable 3: Comparison of the emotional abil-\nity between SOTA MLLMs and EmoLLM.\nMethod\n#Param\nEmo-C\nEmo-O\nGPT-4V\n∼1012\n57.90\n45.10\nGemini1.0\n∼1011\n45.47\n44.83\nGemini1.5\n∼1011\n45.47\n44.83\nEmoLLM\n∼1010\n75.03\n67.14\nTo quantitatively measure the emotional capability of\nEmoLLM, we evaluate its performance on six sub-tasks\nfrom EmoBench, including close-set and open-set emo-\ntion classification, intention recognition, and three spe-\ncial emotional application tasks. As shown in Tab. 2,\nEmoLLM achieves superior performance compared to\nbaselines with the same 7B parameter scale, demon-\nstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.\nWe also compare the emotional understanding abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs on an emotion\nsub-test set. Considering that some MLLMs do not support video and audio, we take a subset of\npure images from EmoBench test set. It contains 6 emotion categories with hundreds of images in\neach category. As presented in Tab. 3, EmoLLM outperforms GPT-4V, Gemini-1.0, and Gemini-1.5\non both close-set (Emo-C) and open-set (Emo-O) emotion classification tasks while maintaining a\nsmaller parameter count.\n5.3\nAblation Studies\nWe conduct ablation studies to explore the key design choices in EmoLLM. All experiments are\nconducted on the Emo-C part of EmoBench test set, with other settings unchanged unless specified.\nMulti-perspective Visual Projection We investigate the impact of the hyperparameter τ in the\nMulti-perspective Visual Projection module by varying its value from 0.05 to 0.5. As shown in Fig. 5\n(left), performance of EmoLLM is sensitive to the choice of τ, with the highest accuracy of 64.06%\nachieved when τ is set to 0.1. The accuracy tends to decline as τ increases, indicating that a suitable\nvalue of τ is beneficial for emotional understanding capabilities of EmoLLM.\nQuantity Effects in EmoPrompt To examine the impact of the number of EmoPrompts on the\nperformance of EmoLLM, we vary the number of prompts from 100 to 1000 and evaluate the\n8\nTable 4: Various training strategies affect emotional understanding ability of LLMs. Training on\ntraditional tasks first and then emotional tasks (sequential) leads to the best results.\nTraining Strategy\nEmo-C\nEmo-O\nIntention\nHate\nHumor\nSarcasm\nOverall\nemo\n61.65\n47.40\n67.71\n62.44\n70.82\n80.22\n56.24\nmix\n63.05+1.40\n49.32+1.92\n73.54+5.83\n65.90+3.46\n67.65-3.17\n83.74+3.52\n58.11+1.87\nsequential\n64.06+2.41\n52.58+5.18\n73.99+6.28\n67.43+4.99\n75.69+4.87\n86.67+6.45\n60.36+4.12\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\n1000\nNumber of EmoPrompts\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n66\nEmo-C Accuracy\n61.37\n62.15\n63.13\n63.41\n63.91 63.89 63.84\n64.06 63.91\nAccuracy\nData Points\n60\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nHyperparameter \n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n66\nEmo-C Accuracy\n61.70\n64.06\n63.24\n63.56\n62.25\n62.48\nAccuracy\nData Points\nFigure 5: Hyperparameter ablation in Multi-perspective Visual Projection and EmoPrompts.\nEmoLLM has the best performance when τ is 0.1.

As depicted in Fig. 5 (right), increasing the number of EmoPrompts generally\nleads to improved performance, with the peak accuracy of 64.06% achieved when all prompts are\nused. This finding highlights the importance of utilizing a diverse set of prompts to enhance the\nemotional reasoning ability of LLMs. However, the performance gains diminish as the number\nof prompts exceeds 600, suggesting an optimal range for balancing computational efficiency and\nemotional understanding.\nEffect of the Tuning Strategy We investigate whether different objective and affective training\nsequences affect the emotional understanding ability of LLMs. In Tab. 4, we compare the performance\nof three training strategies: emo (training with only EmoBench), mix (training with objective fine-\ntuned data mixed with EmoBench), and sequential (fine-tuning with objective data first and then\nwith emotional task). The results suggest that sequential training substantially benefits emotional\nunderstanding. A possible explanation is that it simulates the way humans learn, starting with\neasy tasks and progressing to more difficult ones, while also moving from general knowledge to\ndomain-specific knowledge.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this work, we introduce EmoBench, a comprehensive benchmark for enhancing and evaluating the\nemotional understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), and propose\nEmoLLM, a novel model incorporating Multi-perspective Visual Projection and EmoPrompt tech-\nniques. Through extensive experiments on EmoBench, we demonstrated substantial improvements of\nEmoLLM over baselines, with an average improvement of 12.1% across multiple foundation models.\nLimitations. One notable limitation is that the answers to the instructions in EmoBench may lack\ndiversity since they were generated by GPT-4 and automated scripts rather than collected from human\nannotators. Maybe the future of work combining automation with manual labeling is a promising\ndirection.

Our demo is\navailable at https:\/\/agentsims.com .\n1\nIntroduction\nLLMs have revolutionized Natural Language Pro-\ncessing (NLP) and beyond.\nThey demonstrate\ngreat potential in few-shot learning(Brown et al.,\n2020), code generation(Nijkamp et al., 2023), rea-\nsoning(Yao et al., 2023) and other tasks. Further-\nmore, LLM powered autonomous agents(Weng,\n2023) are widely applied in solving complex prob-\nlems, like multimodal generation(Shen et al., 2023),\nsoftware developing(Qian et al., 2023) and social\nsimulating (Park et al., 2023).\nAlthough LLMs have reformed the paradigm\nof NLP, the problem of evaluation keeps haunt-\ning this field. Old benchmarks become out-of-\ndate. Since LLMs achieve human-level Natural\nLanguage Understanding (NLU) and Natural Lan-\nguage Generation (NLG) abilities(OpenAI, 2023).\nTo address the pressing need for novel benchmarks,\nthe NLP community has introduced an array of\nfresh evaluation tasks and datasets, encompassing a\n∗Corresponding author.\ndiverse spectrum of abilities, including close-book\nquestion-answering (QA) based knowledge test-\ning(Hendrycks et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2023),\nhuman-centric standardized exams(Zhong et al.,\n2023), multi-turn dialogue(Lin and Chen, 2023),\nreasoning(Liu et al., 2023a; bench authors, 2023)\nand safety assessment(Sun et al., 2023).\nHowever, there are still many problems with\nthese new benchmarks. 1) Evaluated abilities are\nlimited by the task formats. Since a majority of\nthese tasks adopt a single-turn QA format, they\nare insufficient to comprehensively evaluate vari-\nous aspects of LLMs’ capabilities. For instance,\nthey fail to assess the models’ proficiency in ad-\nhering to instructions in dialogue or mimicking\nhuman-like social interactions. 2) Benchmarks can\nbe easily hacked. Avoiding the leakage of test set is\nof paramount importance when evaluate a model’s\nability. Nonetheless, considering the amount of\npretrained knowledge of LLM, it has become more\nand more inevitable to inadvertently mix test cases\ninto the training set.(Gunasekar et al., 2023). 3)\nFor open-ended QA, existing metrics are not objec-\ntive. Previous metrics for open-ended QA involve\nautomatic metrics, and human-rating as subjective\nmetrics(Zhou et al., 2023). In the LLM era, text seg-\nment matching based metrics become out-of-date.\nTo mitigate the high-costly issue of human-rating,\ntoday’s researchers employ well-aligned LLMs like\nGPT4 as automatic raters. Nevertheless, the most\nsignificant problem of this approach is that it can\nnot evaluate super GPT4-level models, and LLMs\nare biased toward specific features (Wang et al.,\n2023b).\nBased on these observations, we suggest task-\nbased evaluation for LLM benchmarks. Specifi-\ncally, given an artificial social-economic environ-\nment, LLM-driven agents should achieve the pre-\ndefined task goals to prove their abilities, just like\nhumans accomplishing goals in real world or games\nto show their capacities. Task-based evaluation is\n1\narXiv:2308.04026v1  [cs.AI]  8 Aug 2023\na one-for-all solution for current issues: 1) Task-\nbased evaluation can test an LLM’s overall ability.\nThe complexity of social simulation and adaptation\nfar exceeds simple QA and can formulate more\nchallenging tasks for LLMs. LLM agents need to\nbe equipped with the ability from NLU to Theory\nof Mind (ToM) (Premack and Woodruff, 1978). 2)\nTask solving processes are less likely to be hacked.\nDifferent from unchanged test datasets whose for-\nmats can be easily mimicked and added to training\ndata. Task settings are diversified and the emergent\nsocial behaviors and groups are less likely to be\ndescribed and included in training corpus. 3) Task\npassing rate is an objective metric. Compared with\npopular rating methods by ChatGPT, the passing\nrate does not rely on any black-box rating process,\ni.e. deep neural networks or human brains, thus it\nis an objective and fair metric for the comparison\nbetween LLMs.\nTo all-around estimate LLMs’ capacities, we\nhope researchers from all fields take part in the de-\nvelopment of evaluation tasks. However, a key ob-\nstacle to fostering a collaborative research commu-\nnity is the absence of a standard paradigm, an easy-\nto-use and extensible research platform. Previous\nworks pursue the most efficient way to implement a\nsandbox while ignoring the need of non-specialist\nusers. Besides, the poor readability further results\nin poor extensiblity and user churn. Moreover, the\nagents’ performance varies with different support\nsystems, i.e. memory, planning and tool-use sys-\ntem. We need a standard implementation to ensure\nthe reproducibility of experimental results.\nTo this end, we introduce AgentSims, an inter-\nactive, visualized, and program-based infrastruc-\nture for curating evaluation tasks for LLMs. It\ncreates an artificial town with various buildings\nand residents. The core objective of AgentSims is\nto streamline the task design process, eliminating\nhurdles that researchers from various backgrounds\nand programming proficiencies might encounter.\n• For researchers focusing on LLM, AgentSims\nis extendable and combinable to allow users\nto combine different plan, memory and learning\nsystems to study the impacts and effectiveness of\nvarious system design.\n• For experts from other fields like behavioral eco-\nnomics or social psychology, AgentSims pro-\nvides an interactive UI for map design and agent\ncreation and lower the entry threshold. Such a\nuser-friendly architecture further facilitates the\ncooperation between different fields and the fu-\nture prosperity of the LLM community.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nBenchmarks for Large Language Models\nThe emergency of ChatGPT and other LLMs re-\nquires new benchmarks for effective evaluation.\nbench authors (2023) is the most accepted bench-\nmark to evaluate LLM’s general abilities. It con-\ntains more than 200 tasks, covering from child-\nhood development, to social bias. Zhong et al.\n(2023) collect test tasks from human-centric stan-\ndardized exams like GRE and SAT. (Hendrycks\net al., 2020; Huang et al., 2023) are benchmarks\nfocusing on measuring knowledge acquired in pre-\ntraining. They covers subjects across STEM, the\nhumanities, the social sciences.\nLin and Chen\n(2023) build a benchmark for LLMs’ multiturn\ndialogue abilities. Every dialogue is limited to two\nturns for simplicity. Sun et al. (2023) focus on mea-\nsure the safety of LLMs. They curate a adversarial\nattack dataset containing insulting instructions and\ntest whether LLMs can be jailbroke. However,\nas mentioned above, existing datasets have issues\nthat can not fully demonstrate abilities of LLMs.\nAgentSims overcomes these difficulties and renders\na chance for overall evaluation of LLMs.\n2.2\nMulti Agent Cooperation\nWith LLMs demonstrate their overwhelming abil-\nities, researchers find that multi LLM agents can\ngenerate better results than a single one. Nair et al.\n(2023) is one of the earliest attempts of multi-agent\ncooperation. It builds a forum for agents to com-\nmunicate feedback and iteratively improve their\nhealthcare suggestions. Li et al. (2023) expand\nthe application field of agent cooperation method\nby role-playing. From programming to domain-\nspecific QA, it surpass single agent baselines. Qian\net al. (2023) build a software development com-\npany, by meticulously dividing the development\nprocess into four distinct stages, leading to efficient\nresolution of specific subtasks. Liu et al. (2023b)\nfirst apply multi-agent simulated society for align-\nment, where agents in a sandbox learn from social\ninteraction to understand moral rules. (Park et al.,\n2023) is the most sophisticated application of multi\nagent sandbox. Authors build support mechanisms\nto enable agents to produce believable individual\nand emergent social behaviors. However, none\nexisting methods provide a user-friendly interface\n2\nFigure 1: Front end of AgentSims, showing in a pixel game style. Users can create agents and buildings in the\nleft-side panel and observe agents behaviors in the main screen. Besides setting-then-observing, users can also play\nas the mayor and talk with agents to intervene the experiment.\nfor unprofessional researchers or build a standard\nparadigm for agent support system. Nonetheless,\ncurrent multi-agent systems are task-oriented rather\nthan evaluation-oriented. AgentSims works as a\nplatform for easy benchmark construction.\n3\nKey Components\nAs shown in Figure 2, key components of\nAgentSims can be divided into two parts: 1) genera-\ntive agents driven by LLM support mechanisms. 2)\nbuidlings and equipment that consist the sandbox\nenvironment.\n3.1\nGenerative Agents\nIf prompted properly, LLMs can generate believ-\nable behaviors(Park et al., 2022). However, to\nachieve human-like memory performance and long-\nterm coherence, LLM is not enough. We need aux-\niliary systems to enable agents to perform more\nnaturally. Referring to recent work(Park et al.,\n2023; Wang et al., 2023a), we abstract these sup-\nportive mechanisms into three parts: Planning Sys-\ntem, Memory System, and Tool-Use System.\nPlanning System LLMs have shown some plan-\nning and reasoning capacities. However, faced\nwith complex tasks, vanilla LLMs always fail for\nlacking long-term arrangement abilities. Hence,\nwe introduce a Planning System to ensure agents’\nbehaviors are coherent and believable. The Plan-\nning System reorganizes a goal by decomposing\nthe target, summarizing current condition and gen-\nerating subtasks. Specifically, it is assembled by a\nseries of pluggable prompt modules, which assess\ncurrent achievement of ultimate goals by checking\nthe memory system and making decisions for next\nsteps. Once a new step is completed, it would be\nrecorded in the memory system.\nMemory System. Agents capable of emulating\nhuman behavior necessitate comprehending a vast\narray of experiences, beyond what a prompt can\ncontain. The complete memory stream is too ex-\npensive to be accommodated in the limited context\nwindow, and attempting to do so can overwhelm the\nmodel. Thus, we add a memory system for agents’\nexperience retention and retrieval. The system is\nbuilt upon a vector database for efficient storing and\nretrieving. Specifically, every agent’s daily mem-\nory is encoded into embeddings and stored in the\ndatabase. Every time when agents face some new\nsituation that needs the previous memory, such as\nchatting with familiar people, the memory system\ncan retrieve the information about their relationship\nto improve agent behaviour consistency.\nTool-Use System. Ideally, agents continuously\nexplore the simulated world would learn from pre-\nvious failures and successes, then acquire diverse\nskills. In our framework, to realize this feature, we\npresent a tool-use system, which endows agents\n3\nFigure 2: Overview of AgentSims architecture\nwith the ability to accomplish real-world tasks. Par-\nticularly, the tool use system stores equipment-\noperation pairs learning from feedback of using\nequipment. Once agents select equipment to in-\nteract with by planning and memory system, they\nneed to infer an initial operation by the description\nof the equipment. And the equipment will return an\noperation result as feeedback. If the agent believes\nthe result meets their operation purpose, a new skill\nwould be stored in the Tool-Use System.\n3.2\nBuildings and Equipment\nInteractive buildings and equipment are necessities\nfor the diversity of an LLM sandbox. They com-\npose the physical environments of the simulated\nworld. In our framework, a building or location con-\ntains equipment like stoves or office desks. Thus,\nbuildings are defined by the equipment they con-\ntain and equipment is the basic element composing\nthe interactive environment. More specifically, the\nequipment can be defined by some definition texts\ndescribing its features and support function, which\ncan be either hard-coded by the developer or a\nlanguage model that supports self-adaptive agent-\nequipment interaction. When an agent interacts\nwith equipment, as shown in Figure 2, its operation\ntext will be sent to the background support model.\nThe support function then returns the operation\noutcome based on the predefined rules or model-\ngenerated texts. For example, if an agent wants to\nget a cup of tea from a stove, the operation is ’Get\na cup of tea’ and the support function may return\n’Meaningless operation’ according to the hard code\nor ’You can not get tea from a stove’ generated by\nthe model. Then the agent would learn from the\nfeedback and refine its operations.\n4\nInteraction scenarios\nRegarding the researchers’ backgrounds and pur-\nposes, we design two interaction modes: User\nMode and Developer Mode. In the User Mode, re-\nsearchers who consider little about background sup-\nport systems are target users. For researchers chas-\ning better LLMs performance, Developer Mode\nprovides flexible protocols for their development\nof different support mechanisms.\n4.1\nUser Mode\nIn the User Mode, AgentSims provides an inter-\nactive interface in a pixel game style, as shown in\nFigure 1. Researchers can create agents, construct\nbuildings and equipment in a graphical interface, fo-\ncusing on the rationality of experiment design, free\nfrom complex background driving mechanisms.\nAgent Creation. Users can define agents within\nthe system through an easy-to-use front end, as\nshown in the Figure 3. AgentSims provides various\nprotocols for users to create functional agents. Not\nonly basic information like goals and biography,\nbut also options of Memory and Planning Systems.\nWe pre-design a list of memory and planning sys-\ntems and users can choose their preference from a\ndrop-down menu.\nBuilding Creation. Users can also customize\nthe physical environment by constructing buildings.\nAs shown in Figure 4, users define a building by\nchoosing a pre-configured building with equipment\ninside. To be noticed, the equipment in buildings\nare predefined but can be modified in the Developer\n4\nFigure 3: Agent Creation\nFigure 4: Building Creation\nMode.\nExperiment Intervene.\nBesides observing,\nusers can play as the major agent to participate\nin the experiment. By talking with other agents,\nusers can intervene the experiment naturally rather\nthan modify agents’ memory or goals roughly.\n4.2\nDeveloper Mode\nDeveloper Mode is designed for professional devel-\nopers who are familiar with the properties of LLMs\nand pursue better performance of LLMs on a well-\ndefined complex task. The highly-modularized fea-\nture of AgentSims enables developers to add new\nfunctions within a few lines of code.\nAgent Design. Developers have the flexibility\nto create agents tailored for various objectives and\nassemble diverse agents within a single sandbox\nfor observation. To streamline the process of agent\ncustomization, we’ve abstracted the LLM back-\nbone and distinct support systems into separate\nclasses and function calls, as illustrated below.\nThis empowers developers to personalize an agent\nby making adjustments to these abstract functions.\nclass LLMCaller:\ndef __init__(self, model: str) -> None:\nself.model = get_model(model)\ndef ask(self, prompt: str) :\nresult = self.model.generate(prompt)\nreturn result\nclass Agent:\ndef __init__(self, name, bio, goal, model,\nmemorySystem, planSystem, buildings,\ncash):\nself.state = State()\nself.state.buildings = buildings\nself.state.cash = cash\nself.caller = Caller(model)\ndef plan(self) -> None:\nself.state.plan_prompt = ...\nself.state.plan =\nself.caller.ask(self.state.pl_prompt)\ndef memory_store(self) -> None:\nself.state.memory_prompt = ...\nself.state.memory =\nself.caller.ask(self.state.mem_prompt)\ndef use(self, facility: str, operation: str,\ndescription: str) -> None:\nself.state.use_prompt = ...\nself.state.use =\nself.caller.ask(self.state.use_prompt)\nBuilding and Equipment Design. To customize\nthe physical environment, developers can design\nnew buildings and equipment by configuring corre-\nsponding json files.\nA new equipment can be defined by its type, de-\nscription and a support function.\n[{\"id\": 1,\n\"type\": \"counter\",\n\"function\":...,\n\"description\": \"This is the counter ...\",}]\nIn some cases, agents can purchase commodities\nor earn salaries at the equipment. We use another\nconfigure file to annotate these economic features.\n[{ \"id\": 1,\n\"menu\": {\n\"chicken\": 20,},\n\"salary\":0,}],\nWe define buildings by a type and the equipment it\ncontains. Hence we use a two-dimensional array to\nmark the facility ids in the building blocks.\n[{\"assets\": \"store_v1.2_0719\",\n\"id\": 1,\n\"price\": 2000,\n\"type\": \"store\",\n\"blocks\":[[1,0,0...1,1]],\n\"equipment\":[0,1,0..]]}]\n5\n5\nImplementation\nAgentSims is run using Python 3.91 and requires\ninstalling the requirements.txt file provided in the\ncodebase using Python’s package manager PyPI2.\n5.1\nBackend\nThe web server is built using Tornado3,\na\nlightweight Python web framework. It also uses\nthe websockets library for API calls and push noti-\nfications, and mysql-connector-python to interact\nwith the MySQL4 database.\n5.2\nFrontend\nFrontend The web client is built with Unity5. The\nclient built by WebGL6 is embedded in the project\ncode and can be accessed through a browser after\nproxying with nginx7.\n6\nExample Application Tasks\n6.1\nSubject LLM as participants\nWhen subject LLM agents are participants of an\nartificial scenario, researchers can evaluate LLM’s\nsocial abilities, like ToM . In this case, the formu-\nlation of specific social scenes is realized by other\nbaseline agents driven by stronger LLMs. For ex-\nample, to study a new model’s social adaptation\nabilities in a hostile environment, we can embed\ncolleague agents driven by GPT4 with a strong de-\nsire of bullying newcomers. Then we place subject\nagents into this adversarial milieu and test whether\nthe new model can understand other’s emotion and\nimprove how colleagues perceive it.\n6.2\nSubject LLM as mayor\nTo assess LLM’s long-term planning and organiza-\ntion abilities, researchers can appoint the subject\nLLM as the mayor of a town or the president of a\ncompany, where residents or employees are driven\nby baseline agents like GPT4. To overcome the\ndifficulties set ahead deliberately or emerging dur-\ning the experiments, then achieve the final goal of\nthe task, the subject LLM needs to recruit new resi-\ndents to handle new problems, issue sound policies\n1https:\/\/www.python.org\/downloads\/release\/\npython-390\n2https:\/\/pypi.org\/\n3https:\/\/www.tornadoweb.org\/en\/stable\/\n4https:\/\/www.mysql.com\/\n5https:\/\/unity3d.com\n6https:\/\/get.webgl.org\n7https:\/\/nginx.org\/en\/\nand modify the out-of-date ones, found new func-\ntional buildings to satisfy emerging requirements,\nand so on. By analyzing the success rate of LLM\nmayor under different difficulties, researchers can\ngain valuable insights into the diverse capabilities\nof the LLM.\n6.3\nApplications besides Evaluation\nBesides evaluating LLMs, AgentSims can be used\nas a data generation platform. Due to the fantastic\nNLG abilities of LLMs, researchers have applied\nthem in data annotation and augmentation. How-\never, some data involving social judgement and\nparticipation necessitate a more intricate approach\nthan a single prompt can provide. Thus, we can\nsimulate a specific social background and let LLMs\ngenerate data more precisely. Liu et al. (2023b)\nhave applied simulated society in alignment data\ngeneration. With AgentSims tailored for more intri-\ncate social simulations, its potential for enhancing\ndata generation across various disciplines is unde-\nniable.\nMoreover, our program can also benefit social sci-\nence researchers, by conducting more controllable\npreliminary experiments. Given that sota LLMs\ncan understand human instructions and simulate\nhuman behaviours, social science researchers can\ndesign social environments as they wish for prelim-\ninary studies. Once researchers have a hypothesis,\npilot experiments can be conducted in our virtual\nsandbox as a feasibility check.\n7\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we present AgentSims, avisualized\nand program-based infrastructure for LLM test\nsandbox construction. AgentSims aims to facil-\nitate researchers in effectively building LLM evalu-\nation tasks. It not only intends to make all its code\nopenly available but also commits to continuously\nupdating its documentation with comprehensive\ntutorials.\nLimitations\nAs a sandbox system, AgentSims’ simulation abil-\nity is limited by the accuracy of LLMs and the\ndiversity of buildings and equipment. It can never\nfully reflect real world cases. Besides, although\ntask-based evaluation is a sound approach to mea-\nsure the general ability of LLMs, it can hardly re-\nflect fine-grained abilities like math reasoning. The\npass rate of tasks can not provide insights on why\nLLMs success or fail.\n6","pdf_path":"tools\/arxiv_tools\/asset\/pdf\/\/AgentSims: An Open-Source Sandbox for Large Language Model Evaluation.pdf","query_prompt":"### 任务\n你是一个人工智能领域的专家，你能够快速阅读arxiv上的各种AI前沿论文和相关博客，进而完美地回答学生的问题。\n现在请你阅读以下论文及博客，并回答学生的问题。\n\n### 论文信息\n###  1. 论文标题\n```\nAgentSims: An Open-Source Sandbox for Large Language Model Evaluation\n```\n#### 2. 论文摘要\n```\nWith ChatGPT-like large language models (LLM) prevailing in the community,\nhow to evaluate the ability of LLMs is an open question.

Existing evaluation methods suffer from\nfollowing shortcomings: (1) constrained evalu-\nation abilities, (2) vulnerable benchmarks, (3)\nunobjective metrics.\nWe suggest that task-\nbased evaluation, where LLM agents complete\ntasks in a simulated environment, is a one-\nfor-all solution to solve above problems. We\npresent AgentSims, an easy-to-use infrastruc-\nture for researchers from all disciplines to test\nthe specific capacities they are interested in.\nResearchers can build their evaluation tasks by\nadding agents and buildings on an interactive\nGUI or deploy and test new support mecha-\nnisms, i.e. memory, planning and tool-use sys-\ntems, by a few lines of codes. Our demo is\navailable at https:\/\/agentsims.com .\n1\nIntroduction\nLLMs have revolutionized Natural Language Pro-\ncessing (NLP) and beyond.\nThey demonstrate\ngreat potential in few-shot learning(Brown et al.,\n2020), code generation(Nijkamp et al., 2023), rea-\nsoning(Yao et al., 2023) and other tasks. Further-\nmore, LLM powered autonomous agents(Weng,\n2023) are widely applied in solving complex prob-\nlems, like multimodal generation(Shen et al., 2023),\nsoftware developing(Qian et al., 2023) and social\nsimulating (Park et al., 2023).\nAlthough LLMs have reformed the paradigm\nof NLP, the problem of evaluation keeps haunt-\ning this field. Old benchmarks become out-of-\ndate. Since LLMs achieve human-level Natural\nLanguage Understanding (NLU) and Natural Lan-\nguage Generation (NLG) abilities(OpenAI, 2023).\nTo address the pressing need for novel benchmarks,\nthe NLP community has introduced an array of\nfresh evaluation tasks and datasets, encompassing a\n∗Corresponding author.\ndiverse spectrum of abilities, including close-book\nquestion-answering (QA) based knowledge test-\ning(Hendrycks et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2023),\nhuman-centric standardized exams(Zhong et al.,\n2023), multi-turn dialogue(Lin and Chen, 2023),\nreasoning(Liu et al., 2023a; bench authors, 2023)\nand safety assessment(Sun et al., 2023).\nHowever, there are still many problems with\nthese new benchmarks. 1) Evaluated abilities are\nlimited by the task formats. Since a majority of\nthese tasks adopt a single-turn QA format, they\nare insufficient to comprehensively evaluate vari-\nous aspects of LLMs’ capabilities. For instance,\nthey fail to assess the models’ proficiency in ad-\nhering to instructions in dialogue or mimicking\nhuman-like social interactions. 2) Benchmarks can\nbe easily hacked. Avoiding the leakage of test set is\nof paramount importance when evaluate a model’s\nability. Nonetheless, considering the amount of\npretrained knowledge of LLM, it has become more\nand more inevitable to inadvertently mix test cases\ninto the training set.(Gunasekar et al., 2023). 3)\nFor open-ended QA, existing metrics are not objec-\ntive. Previous metrics for open-ended QA involve\nautomatic metrics, and human-rating as subjective\nmetrics(Zhou et al., 2023). In the LLM era, text seg-\nment matching based metrics become out-of-date.\nTo mitigate the high-costly issue of human-rating,\ntoday’s researchers employ well-aligned LLMs like\nGPT4 as automatic raters. Nevertheless, the most\nsignificant problem of this approach is that it can\nnot evaluate super GPT4-level models, and LLMs\nare biased toward specific features (Wang et al.,\n2023b).\nBased on these observations, we suggest task-\nbased evaluation for LLM benchmarks. Specifi-\ncally, given an artificial social-economic environ-\nment, LLM-driven agents should achieve the pre-\ndefined task goals to prove their abilities, just like\nhumans accomplishing goals in real world or games\nto show their capacities. Task-based evaluation is\n1\narXiv:2308.04026v1  [cs.AI]  8 Aug 2023\na one-for-all solution for current issues: 1) Task-\nbased evaluation can test an LLM’s overall ability.\nThe complexity of social simulation and adaptation\nfar exceeds simple QA and can formulate more\nchallenging tasks for LLMs. LLM agents need to\nbe equipped with the ability from NLU to Theory\nof Mind (ToM) (Premack and Woodruff, 1978). 2)\nTask solving processes are less likely to be hacked.\nDifferent from unchanged test datasets whose for-\nmats can be easily mimicked and added to training\ndata. Task settings are diversified and the emergent\nsocial behaviors and groups are less likely to be\ndescribed and included in training corpus. 3) Task\npassing rate is an objective metric. Compared with\npopular rating methods by ChatGPT, the passing\nrate does not rely on any black-box rating process,\ni.e. deep neural networks or human brains, thus it\nis an objective and fair metric for the comparison\nbetween LLMs.\nTo all-around estimate LLMs’ capacities, we\nhope researchers from all fields take part in the de-\nvelopment of evaluation tasks. However, a key ob-\nstacle to fostering a collaborative research commu-\nnity is the absence of a standard paradigm, an easy-\nto-use and extensible research platform. Previous\nworks pursue the most efficient way to implement a\nsandbox while ignoring the need of non-specialist\nusers. Besides, the poor readability further results\nin poor extensiblity and user churn. Moreover, the\nagents’ performance varies with different support\nsystems, i.e. memory, planning and tool-use sys-\ntem. We need a standard implementation to ensure\nthe reproducibility of experimental results.\nTo this end, we introduce AgentSims, an inter-\nactive, visualized, and program-based infrastruc-\nture for curating evaluation tasks for LLMs. It\ncreates an artificial town with various buildings\nand residents. The core objective of AgentSims is\nto streamline the task design process, eliminating\nhurdles that researchers from various backgrounds\nand programming proficiencies might encounter.\n• For researchers focusing on LLM, AgentSims\nis extendable and combinable to allow users\nto combine different plan, memory and learning\nsystems to study the impacts and effectiveness of\nvarious system design.\n• For experts from other fields like behavioral eco-\nnomics or social psychology, AgentSims pro-\nvides an interactive UI for map design and agent\ncreation and lower the entry threshold. Such a\nuser-friendly architecture further facilitates the\ncooperation between different fields and the fu-\nture prosperity of the LLM community.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nBenchmarks for Large Language Models\nThe emergency of ChatGPT and other LLMs re-\nquires new benchmarks for effective evaluation.\nbench authors (2023) is the most accepted bench-\nmark to evaluate LLM’s general abilities. It con-\ntains more than 200 tasks, covering from child-\nhood development, to social bias. Zhong et al.\n(2023) collect test tasks from human-centric stan-\ndardized exams like GRE and SAT. (Hendrycks\net al., 2020; Huang et al., 2023) are benchmarks\nfocusing on measuring knowledge acquired in pre-\ntraining. They covers subjects across STEM, the\nhumanities, the social sciences.\nLin and Chen\n(2023) build a benchmark for LLMs’ multiturn\ndialogue abilities. Every dialogue is limited to two\nturns for simplicity. Sun et al. (2023) focus on mea-\nsure the safety of LLMs. They curate a adversarial\nattack dataset containing insulting instructions and\ntest whether LLMs can be jailbroke. However,\nas mentioned above, existing datasets have issues\nthat can not fully demonstrate abilities of LLMs.\nAgentSims overcomes these difficulties and renders\na chance for overall evaluation of LLMs.\n2.2\nMulti Agent Cooperation\nWith LLMs demonstrate their overwhelming abil-\nities, researchers find that multi LLM agents can\ngenerate better results than a single one. Nair et al.\n(2023) is one of the earliest attempts of multi-agent\ncooperation. It builds a forum for agents to com-\nmunicate feedback and iteratively improve their\nhealthcare suggestions. Li et al. (2023) expand\nthe application field of agent cooperation method\nby role-playing. From programming to domain-\nspecific QA, it surpass single agent baselines. Qian\net al. (2023) build a software development com-\npany, by meticulously dividing the development\nprocess into four distinct stages, leading to efficient\nresolution of specific subtasks. Liu et al. (2023b)\nfirst apply multi-agent simulated society for align-\nment, where agents in a sandbox learn from social\ninteraction to understand moral rules. (Park et al.,\n2023) is the most sophisticated application of multi\nagent sandbox. Authors build support mechanisms\nto enable agents to produce believable individual\nand emergent social behaviors. However, none\nexisting methods provide a user-friendly interface\n2\nFigure 1: Front end of AgentSims, showing in a pixel game style. Users can create agents and buildings in the\nleft-side panel and observe agents behaviors in the main screen. Besides setting-then-observing, users can also play\nas the mayor and talk with agents to intervene the experiment.\nfor unprofessional researchers or build a standard\nparadigm for agent support system. Nonetheless,\ncurrent multi-agent systems are task-oriented rather\nthan evaluation-oriented. AgentSims works as a\nplatform for easy benchmark construction.\n3\nKey Components\nAs shown in Figure 2, key components of\nAgentSims can be divided into two parts: 1) genera-\ntive agents driven by LLM support mechanisms. 2)\nbuidlings and equipment that consist the sandbox\nenvironment.\n3.1\nGenerative Agents\nIf prompted properly, LLMs can generate believ-\nable behaviors(Park et al., 2022). However, to\nachieve human-like memory performance and long-\nterm coherence, LLM is not enough. We need aux-\niliary systems to enable agents to perform more\nnaturally. Referring to recent work(Park et al.,\n2023; Wang et al., 2023a), we abstract these sup-\nportive mechanisms into three parts: Planning Sys-\ntem, Memory System, and Tool-Use System.\nPlanning System LLMs have shown some plan-\nning and reasoning capacities. However, faced\nwith complex tasks, vanilla LLMs always fail for\nlacking long-term arrangement abilities. Hence,\nwe introduce a Planning System to ensure agents’\nbehaviors are coherent and believable. The Plan-\nning System reorganizes a goal by decomposing\nthe target, summarizing current condition and gen-\nerating subtasks. Specifically, it is assembled by a\nseries of pluggable prompt modules, which assess\ncurrent achievement of ultimate goals by checking\nthe memory system and making decisions for next\nsteps. Once a new step is completed, it would be\nrecorded in the memory system.\nMemory System. Agents capable of emulating\nhuman behavior necessitate comprehending a vast\narray of experiences, beyond what a prompt can\ncontain. The complete memory stream is too ex-\npensive to be accommodated in the limited context\nwindow, and attempting to do so can overwhelm the\nmodel. Thus, we add a memory system for agents’\nexperience retention and retrieval. The system is\nbuilt upon a vector database for efficient storing and\nretrieving. Specifically, every agent’s daily mem-\nory is encoded into embeddings and stored in the\ndatabase. Every time when agents face some new\nsituation that needs the previous memory, such as\nchatting with familiar people, the memory system\ncan retrieve the information about their relationship\nto improve agent behaviour consistency.\nTool-Use System. Ideally, agents continuously\nexplore the simulated world would learn from pre-\nvious failures and successes, then acquire diverse\nskills. In our framework, to realize this feature, we\npresent a tool-use system, which endows agents\n3\nFigure 2: Overview of AgentSims architecture\nwith the ability to accomplish real-world tasks. Par-\nticularly, the tool use system stores equipment-\noperation pairs learning from feedback of using\nequipment. Once agents select equipment to in-\nteract with by planning and memory system, they\nneed to infer an initial operation by the description\nof the equipment. And the equipment will return an\noperation result as feeedback. If the agent believes\nthe result meets their operation purpose, a new skill\nwould be stored in the Tool-Use System.\n3.2\nBuildings and Equipment\nInteractive buildings and equipment are necessities\nfor the diversity of an LLM sandbox. They com-\npose the physical environments of the simulated\nworld. In our framework, a building or location con-\ntains equipment like stoves or office desks. Thus,\nbuildings are defined by the equipment they con-\ntain and equipment is the basic element composing\nthe interactive environment. More specifically, the\nequipment can be defined by some definition texts\ndescribing its features and support function, which\ncan be either hard-coded by the developer or a\nlanguage model that supports self-adaptive agent-\nequipment interaction. When an agent interacts\nwith equipment, as shown in Figure 2, its operation\ntext will be sent to the background support model.\nThe support function then returns the operation\noutcome based on the predefined rules or model-\ngenerated texts. For example, if an agent wants to\nget a cup of tea from a stove, the operation is ’Get\na cup of tea’ and the support function may return\n’Meaningless operation’ according to the hard code\nor ’You can not get tea from a stove’ generated by\nthe model. Then the agent would learn from the\nfeedback and refine its operations.\n4\nInteraction scenarios\nRegarding the researchers’ backgrounds and pur-\nposes, we design two interaction modes: User\nMode and Developer Mode. In the User Mode, re-\nsearchers who consider little about background sup-\nport systems are target users. For researchers chas-\ning better LLMs performance, Developer Mode\nprovides flexible protocols for their development\nof different support mechanisms.\n4.1\nUser Mode\nIn the User Mode, AgentSims provides an inter-\nactive interface in a pixel game style, as shown in\nFigure 1. Researchers can create agents, construct\nbuildings and equipment in a graphical interface, fo-\ncusing on the rationality of experiment design, free\nfrom complex background driving mechanisms.\nAgent Creation. Users can define agents within\nthe system through an easy-to-use front end, as\nshown in the Figure 3. AgentSims provides various\nprotocols for users to create functional agents. Not\nonly basic information like goals and biography,\nbut also options of Memory and Planning Systems.\nWe pre-design a list of memory and planning sys-\ntems and users can choose their preference from a\ndrop-down menu.\nBuilding Creation. Users can also customize\nthe physical environment by constructing buildings.\nAs shown in Figure 4, users define a building by\nchoosing a pre-configured building with equipment\ninside. To be noticed, the equipment in buildings\nare predefined but can be modified in the Developer\n4\nFigure 3: Agent Creation\nFigure 4: Building Creation\nMode.\nExperiment Intervene.\nBesides observing,\nusers can play as the major agent to participate\nin the experiment. By talking with other agents,\nusers can intervene the experiment naturally rather\nthan modify agents’ memory or goals roughly.\n4.2\nDeveloper Mode\nDeveloper Mode is designed for professional devel-\nopers who are familiar with the properties of LLMs\nand pursue better performance of LLMs on a well-\ndefined complex task. The highly-modularized fea-\nture of AgentSims enables developers to add new\nfunctions within a few lines of code.\nAgent Design. Developers have the flexibility\nto create agents tailored for various objectives and\nassemble diverse agents within a single sandbox\nfor observation. To streamline the process of agent\ncustomization, we’ve abstracted the LLM back-\nbone and distinct support systems into separate\nclasses and function calls, as illustrated below.\nThis empowers developers to personalize an agent\nby making adjustments to these abstract functions.\nclass LLMCaller:\ndef __init__(self, model: str) -> None:\nself.model = get_model(model)\ndef ask(self, prompt: str) :\nresult = self.model.generate(prompt)\nreturn result\nclass Agent:\ndef __init__(self, name, bio, goal, model,\nmemorySystem, planSystem, buildings,\ncash):\nself.state = State()\nself.state.buildings = buildings\nself.state.cash = cash\nself.caller = Caller(model)\ndef plan(self) -> None:\nself.state.plan_prompt = ...\nself.state.plan =\nself.caller.ask(self.state.pl_prompt)\ndef memory_store(self) -> None:\nself.state.memory_prompt = ...\nself.state.memory =\nself.caller.ask(self.state.mem_prompt)\ndef use(self, facility: str, operation: str,\ndescription: str) -> None:\nself.state.use_prompt = ...\nself.state.use =\nself.caller.ask(self.state.use_prompt)\nBuilding and Equipment Design. To customize\nthe physical environment, developers can design\nnew buildings and equipment by configuring corre-\nsponding json files.\nA new equipment can be defined by its type, de-\nscription and a support function.\n[{\"id\": 1,\n\"type\": \"counter\",\n\"function\":...,\n\"description\": \"This is the counter ...\",}]\nIn some cases, agents can purchase commodities\nor earn salaries at the equipment. We use another\nconfigure file to annotate these economic features.\n[{ \"id\": 1,\n\"menu\": {\n\"chicken\": 20,},\n\"salary\":0,}],\nWe define buildings by a type and the equipment it\ncontains. Hence we use a two-dimensional array to\nmark the facility ids in the building blocks.\n[{\"assets\": \"store_v1.2_0719\",\n\"id\": 1,\n\"price\": 2000,\n\"type\": \"store\",\n\"blocks\":[[1,0,0...1,1]],\n\"equipment\":[0,1,0..]]}]\n5\n5\nImplementation\nAgentSims is run using Python 3.91 and requires\ninstalling the requirements.txt file provided in the\ncodebase using Python’s package manager PyPI2.\n5.1\nBackend\nThe web server is built using Tornado3,\na\nlightweight Python web framework. It also uses\nthe websockets library for API calls and push noti-\nfications, and mysql-connector-python to interact\nwith the MySQL4 database.\n5.2\nFrontend\nFrontend The web client is built with Unity5. The\nclient built by WebGL6 is embedded in the project\ncode and can be accessed through a browser after\nproxying with nginx7.\n6\nExample Application Tasks\n6.1\nSubject LLM as participants\nWhen subject LLM agents are participants of an\nartificial scenario, researchers can evaluate LLM’s\nsocial abilities, like ToM . In this case, the formu-\nlation of specific social scenes is realized by other\nbaseline agents driven by stronger LLMs. For ex-\nample, to study a new model’s social adaptation\nabilities in a hostile environment, we can embed\ncolleague agents driven by GPT4 with a strong de-\nsire of bullying newcomers. Then we place subject\nagents into this adversarial milieu and test whether\nthe new model can understand other’s emotion and\nimprove how colleagues perceive it.\n6.2\nSubject LLM as mayor\nTo assess LLM’s long-term planning and organiza-\ntion abilities, researchers can appoint the subject\nLLM as the mayor of a town or the president of a\ncompany, where residents or employees are driven\nby baseline agents like GPT4. To overcome the\ndifficulties set ahead deliberately or emerging dur-\ning the experiments, then achieve the final goal of\nthe task, the subject LLM needs to recruit new resi-\ndents to handle new problems, issue sound policies\n1https:\/\/www.python.org\/downloads\/release\/\npython-390\n2https:\/\/pypi.org\/\n3https:\/\/www.tornadoweb.org\/en\/stable\/\n4https:\/\/www.mysql.com\/\n5https:\/\/unity3d.com\n6https:\/\/get.webgl.org\n7https:\/\/nginx.org\/en\/\nand modify the out-of-date ones, found new func-\ntional buildings to satisfy emerging requirements,\nand so on. By analyzing the success rate of LLM\nmayor under different difficulties, researchers can\ngain valuable insights into the diverse capabilities\nof the LLM.\n6.3\nApplications besides Evaluation\nBesides evaluating LLMs, AgentSims can be used\nas a data generation platform. Due to the fantastic\nNLG abilities of LLMs, researchers have applied\nthem in data annotation and augmentation. How-\never, some data involving social judgement and\nparticipation necessitate a more intricate approach\nthan a single prompt can provide. Thus, we can\nsimulate a specific social background and let LLMs\ngenerate data more precisely. Liu et al. (2023b)\nhave applied simulated society in alignment data\ngeneration. With AgentSims tailored for more intri-\ncate social simulations, its potential for enhancing\ndata generation across various disciplines is unde-\nniable.\nMoreover, our program can also benefit social sci-\nence researchers, by conducting more controllable\npreliminary experiments. Given that sota LLMs\ncan understand human instructions and simulate\nhuman behaviours, social science researchers can\ndesign social environments as they wish for prelim-\ninary studies. Once researchers have a hypothesis,\npilot experiments can be conducted in our virtual\nsandbox as a feasibility check.\n7\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we present AgentSims, avisualized\nand program-based infrastructure for LLM test\nsandbox construction. AgentSims aims to facil-\nitate researchers in effectively building LLM evalu-\nation tasks. It not only intends to make all its code\nopenly available but also commits to continuously\nupdating its documentation with comprehensive\ntutorials.\nLimitations\nAs a sandbox system, AgentSims’ simulation abil-\nity is limited by the accuracy of LLMs and the\ndiversity of buildings and equipment. It can never\nfully reflect real world cases. Besides, although\ntask-based evaluation is a sound approach to mea-\nsure the general ability of LLMs, it can hardly re-\nflect fine-grained abilities like math reasoning. The\npass rate of tasks can not provide insights on why\nLLMs success or fail.\n6\n```\n\n#### 5. 学生问题\n问题1：介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」\n问题2：这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？\n问题3：这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？\n\n\n请输出论文总结\n### 输出格式（输出语言用中文）\n```\n## 💡 解答问题1 (...复述学生问题1...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (...复述学生问题2...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (...复述学生问题3...)\n...\n```\n","llm_summary_res":"## 🌟 论文解读 | AgentSims：大型语言模型评估的开放源代码沙盒\n\n## 📌 背景痛点\/本文动机\n随着ChatGPT等大型语言模型（LLM）在社区中的普及，如何评估LLM的能力成为一个开放性问题。现有的评估方法存在以下不足：\n1. 评估能力受限：大多数任务采用单轮问答格式，无法全面评估LLM的各种能力。\n2. 基准易受攻击：由于LLM具有大量的预训练知识，测试集容易无意中混入训练集。\n3. 指标不客观：现有的开放式问答指标涉及自动指标和主观指标，无法客观评估LLM的能力。\n\n## 🚀 核心方法\n本文提出了基于任务的评估方法，即LLM代理在模拟环境中完成任务来证明其能力。为了解决现有评估方法的不足，本文提出了AgentSims，一个易于使用的评估LLM能力的平台。AgentSims具有以下特点：\n1. 可扩展性和可组合性：允许用户组合不同的计划、记忆和使用工具系统，研究各种系统设计的影响和有效性。\n2. 交互式用户界面：为地图设计和代理创建提供交互式UI，降低非专业人士的入门门槛。\n3. 标准化实现：确保实验结果的再现性。\n\n## 📈 实验结果\n本文展示了AgentSims在评估LLM能力方面的应用，包括：\n1. 评估LLM的社会能力，如心智理论（ToM）。\n2. 评估LLM的长期规划和组织能力，如担任市长或公司总裁。\n3. 作为数据生成平台，用于数据标注和增强。\n4. 为社会科学研究提供可控的初步实验环境。\n\n## 💬 可借鉴之处\nAgentSims为LLM评估提供了一个开放源代码的沙盒平台，具有以下可借鉴之处：\n1. 基于任务的评估方法，可以更全面地评估LLM的能力。\n2. 交互式用户界面，降低非专业人士的入门门槛。\n3. 标准化实现，确保实验结果的再现性。\n4. 可扩展性和可组合性，方便用户研究和开发新的支持系统。","llm_summary_res_status":200,"order":25,"query_answer":"## 💡 解答问题1 (介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」)\n\n这篇论文提出的benchmark是AgentSims，它是一个开放源代码的沙盒平台，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）的能力。AgentSims通过模拟一个社会-经济环境，让LLM驱动的代理完成预定义的任务目标来证明其能力。这种基于任务的评估方法可以更全面地评估LLM的能力，包括社会能力、长期规划和组织能力等。\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？)\n\n论文中并没有明确说明AgentSims需要什么设备条件。但是，由于AgentSims是一个基于Python的框架，并且使用了Tornado web服务器和Unity前端，因此它应该可以在大多数现代计算机上运行。至于模型训练和推理使用的设备，论文中也没有明确说明。但是，由于LLM通常需要大量的计算资源，因此训练和推理LLM模型可能需要高性能的GPU和足够的内存。\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？)\n\nAgentSims的环境并没有明确提到结果奖励或过程奖励。然而，由于AgentSims是一个基于任务的评估平台，代理完成任务的成功率可以作为评估LLM能力的指标。这种指标是客观的，因为它不依赖于任何黑盒评级过程，如深度神经网络或人脑。因此，AgentSims可以支持RL类模型在这个平台上进行评估，并且不容易受到reward hacking的影响。","query_answer_status":200}

However,\nrelated work includes game-speciﬁc engineering to achieve the\nresults. We take a step towards a general approach and study\nthe general applicability of behavioural cloning on twelve video\ngames, including six modern video games (published after 2010),\nby using human demonstrations as training data. Our results\nshow that these agents cannot match humans in raw performance\nbut do learn basic dynamics and rules. We also demonstrate how\nthe quality of the data matters, and how recording data from\nhumans is subject to a state-action mismatch, due to human\nreﬂexes.\nIndex Terms—video game, behavioral cloning, imitation learn-\ning, reinforcement learning, learning environment, neural net-\nworks\nI. INTRODUCTION\nReinforcement learning (RL) [1] has been successfully\napplied to create super-human players in multiple video games,\nincluding classic Atari 2600 games [2], as well as more mod-\nern shooters [3], MOBAs [4], [5] and real-time strategy games\n[6]. Even more so, all before-mentioned accomplishments\nuse “end-to-end” systems, where input features are not pre-\nprocessed by crafting speciﬁc features, and instead rely on raw\ninformation like image pixels. However, RL is not without\nits limitations: they require an environment where to play\nthe game. Whether this is achieved by modifying an existing\ngame (like Starcraft II [7]) or by using their engines to create\nenvironments from ground-up (like Unity ML-Agents [8]), it\n*Equal contribution, alphabetical ordering.

Even worse, after the\nenvironment is created, training the agents may take thousands\nof years of in-game time [4], [6].\nAn alternative approach is imitation learning, in which\nagents learn to replicate demonstrators’ actions. Behavioural\ncloning (BC) [9] is the simplest form of this: given an\nobservation and an associated action from a demonstrator,\npredict this action based on observation (i.e a classiﬁcation\ntask). This has been used to kick-start RL agents [6], [10], but\nalso applied alone in e.g. autonomous driving [9], [11], [12],\nand Vinyals et al. [6] show that Starcraft II can be played at\nproﬁcient human-level with behavioural cloning alone. This\nbegs the question: How well can behavioural cloning play\nvideo games, in general? Can we reach the level of a human\nplayer? How much data do we need? Do we need data from\nmultiple players?\nIf we can create performant, end-to-end agents with BC\nand human gameplay alone, it would skip many hurdles\nexperienced with RL: we do not need to create an environment\nfor agents to play in, nor do we need to spend large amounts\nof compute resources for training. We only need the video\ngame, a tool to record the gameplay, and players for the game.\nIf BC can manage with just an hour or two of gameplay\ndemonstration, a single person could record the demonstration\ndata. If the recording tool captures the same output and input\na human player would have (i.e. image of the screen and\nkeyboard\/mouse, end-to-end), this would require no game-\nspeciﬁc coding and could be applied to any game. Even if\nBC does not reach human-level performance, it could still be\nused as a starting point for other learning methods, or as a\nsupport for diversifying the agent’s behaviour [6].\nVideo games have been in active use as benchmarks in\nresearch using BC [10], [13]–[15], and as milestones to beat\nin AI research [2], [5], [6]. The other way around, “BC for\nvideo games”, has seen works like human-like bots in ﬁrst-\nperson shooter (FPS) games using hand-crafted features and\nimitation learning [16]–[18], end-to-end FPS bots with RL and\nBC [19]. Our setting and motivation resemble the motivation\nof [20], where authors employ end-to-end imitation learning\nto play two Nintendo 64 games successfully. However, these\nstudies have been limited to only a few games a time, making it\nhard to tell how well BC performs in general at playing video\narXiv:2004.00981v2  [cs.AI]  18 May 2020\nFig. 1.\nGames tested with behavioural cloning.

Apart from [15], related work does not study how data\nshould be chosen for behavioural cloning. In addition, Zhang\net al. [14] bring up an important point on how human delay\ncan adversarially affect the quality of the dataset but did not\ninclude experimental results on this.\nIn this work, we aim to answer these three questions and\nto assess the general applicability of end-to-end behavioural\ncloning for video game playing. We use data from human\ndemonstrators to train a deep network to predict their actions,\ngiven the same observations human players saw (the screen\nimage). We run empirical experiments to study how well\nBC agents play Atari 2600 games, Doom (1993) and various\nmodern video games. Along with the raw performance, we\nstudy the effect of quality and quantity of the training data, and\nthe effect of delay of human reﬂexes on the data quality. Along\nthe results, we present ViControl (“Visual Control”), a multi-\nplatform tool to record and play an arbitrary game, which we\nuse to do behavioural cloning on the modern games. ViControl\nis available at https:\/\/github.com\/joonaspu\/ViControl.\nII. END-TO-END BEHAVIOURAL CLONING FOR VIDEO\nGAMES\nA. Behavioural cloning\nWe wish to train computer to play a game, based on given\ndemonstrations of humans playing it. We model the environ-\nment as a truncated version of Markov Decision Processes\n(MDPs) [1], where playing the game consists of observations\ns ∈S and associated actions a ∈A. We do not include a\nnotion of time, reward signal nor terminal\/initial states. The\ntask of behavioural cloning is simple: given a dataset of human\ngameplay D containing tuples (s, a), learn the conditional\ndistribution p(a|s), i.e. probability of human players picking\naction a in state s. After learning this distribution, we can\nuse it to play the game by sampling an action a ∼p(a|s) for\na given state s (agent). An immediate limitation here is the\nlack of temporal modelling, or “memory”, which could limit\nthe agent’s abilities. It has been shown that including past\ninformation with behavioural cloning can be detrimental to\nperformance [21], but on the other hand there exists work that\nsuccessfully do BC with recurrent neural networks [22]. We\nopt not to use recurrent networks for the model and training\nsimplicity, and as most of the games used in this work do not\nrequire memory to master.\nWe take an end-to-end approach, where states are pixels of\nan RGB image s ∈RH×W ×3, H, W ∈N, and actions a are\na vector of one or more discrete variables ai ∈0, 1, . . . di,\nwhere i ∈N represents the number of discrete variables, and\ndi tells the number of options per discrete variable. In Atari\nenvironments [23], action contains one discrete variable with\n18 options, including all possible choices human player could\nmake (multi-class classiﬁcation task). With a PC game using a\nkeyboard with, say, four buttons available, the actions consist\nof four discrete variables, all with two options: down or up\n(multi-label classiﬁcation task).\nTo model the conditional distribution p(a|s), we use deep\nneural networks. They support the different actions we could\nhave and are known to excel in image classiﬁcation tasks [24].\nWe treat action discrete variables i independent from each\nother, and the network is trained to minimize cross-entropy\nbetween predictions and labels in the dataset.\nB. Challenges of general end-to-end control of video games\nCompared to Atari 2600 games and Doom (1993), modern\nvideo games (published after 2010) can take advantage of more\ncomputing power and tend to be more complex when it comes\nto visual aesthetics and dynamics. We also do not assume to\nhave control over game program’s ﬂow, so the game will run\nat a ﬁxed rate, as humans would experience it. All-together,\nthese raise some speciﬁc challenges for generalized end-to-end\ncontrol, where we wish to avoid per-game engineering.\na) High resolution: Modern games commonly run at\n“high deﬁnition” resolutions, with most common monitor\nresolution for players being 1920×1080. However, RL and BC\nagents resize images to small resolutions due to computational\nefﬁciency, usually capped around 200 to 300 pixels per axis\n[3], [25], and commonly lower [2], [10]. If we take a modern\ngame with a resolution of at least 1280×720, and downscale it\nto these resolutions, we lose a great deal of detail: any smaller\nuser-interface (UI) elements, like text, may get blurred out, and\nalready-small objects on the screen may disappear completely.\nOn top of this, different interpolation methods used for resizing\nimages have been reported to affect the training results [20],\n[26]. We leave approaches for solving this to future work, and\nsimply resize the images.\nb) Complex action space: The natural action space of\na computer game, a keyboard and a mouse, contains over a\nhundred keys to press in total, as well as the movement of the\nmouse. Such large action spaces have shown to be an issue to\nRL agents [27], [28], and many of these buttons do nothing\nin games (when was the last time you have used Insert\nin a video game?). Even when we modify the action space to\nonly include buttons that are used by the game, we can end up\nwith a large, parametrized action space with its own difﬁculties\n[29], like in Starcraft II [7]. We pre-deﬁne a minimal set of\nactions required to play games in this work.\nc) Asynchronous execution: As the game environment\nruns asynchronously from the agent’s decisions, the agent must\nexecute an action quickly after observing an image, otherwise\nits decisions will lag behind. This “control delay” is known\nto reduce performance of RL methods [30], [31]. In addition,\nif we gather BC data from human players, the recorded ac-\ntions are subject to delays from human-reﬂexes. If something\nsurprising happens on the screen, average humans react to\nthis with a split-second delay. This action was supposed to\nbe associated with the surprising event, but instead it will be\nrecorded few frames later, associated with possibly a wrong\nobservation. Other way around, human players could plan\ntheir action before the observation and execute it pre-maturely.\nThese both lead to state-action mismatch [14], effect of which\nwe study in the experiments.\nd) Confounding information:\nBehavioural cloning is\nprone to causal confusion [21] or “superstition” [32], where\nproviding more information may be detrimental to BC\nagent’s performance. With more information (e.g. history,\npast frames\/actions), the model has a larger chance to ﬁnd\nmisleading correlations between observations and actions. For\nexample, ﬁring a plasma-weapon in Doom. This creates a\nblue, long-lasting muzzle-ﬂash on the weapon. Since many\nframes with ATTACK pressed down include this blue ﬂash,\nthe model learns to focus on this ﬂash to predict if we should\nﬁre the weapon. However, the ﬂash is not the cause of ﬁring\nthe weapon, it is the effect. Similarly, games have numerous\nUI elements with various information, which could lead to\nsimilar confusion. In this work we do not provide historical\ninformation to the agent, limiting its capabilities in exchange\nfor less chance of destructive causal confusion.\nIII. RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nAlong with the main evaluation of BC in different games,\nwe study two important aspects of the training setup, brought\nup by related work: “how does the quantity and quality of\nthe data affect the results?” [15], and “how the state-action\nmismatch from human reﬂexes affects the results?” [14]. The\nformer sheds light on if we should gather data from only few\nexperts, or should we use data from many different players.\nA similar comparison of different sized datasets was done in\n[15]. The latter was brought up by authors of [14], but without\nexperimental results.\n0\n20000\nScore\nDensity\nMs. Pac-Man\nAtari-HEAD\nAtari GC\n0\n20000 40000\nScore\nVideo Pinball\n0\n20000\nScore\nQ*bert\n0\n20000\n40000\nScore\nMontezuma's\nRevenge\n0\n2000\n4000\nScore\nSpace\nInvaders\nFig. 2.\nComparison of the score distribution in the Atari Grand Challenge\n(Atari-GC) dataset and in the Atari-HEAD dataset. Atari-HEAD does not have\ndata for Video Pinball or Q*bert\nTo study the state-action mismatch, we run experiments with\nmodiﬁed versions of the Atari and ViZDoom datasets, where\nan action delay d is added between the state and action. In\nthe modiﬁed datasets, the state si at frame i is matched with\nan action ai+d. Both positive and negative values are used for\nthe action delay d.\nWe will use Atari [23] and Doom [33] environments to\nanswer these questions, as they can be used synchronously\nand therefore allow fast evaluation of trained models. We will\nthen include six modern video games to assess how well BC\nworks under the challenges presented in Section II-B. Images\nof all of the games are shown in Figure 1. Code used to run\nthese experiments is available at https:\/\/github.com\/joonaspu\/\nvideo-game-behavioural-cloning.\nA. Evaluation\nFor the Atari and Doom experiments, each training run\nis evaluated by taking models from the three last epochs of\ntraining, evaluating their performance and averaging over. The\ntraining is then repeated three times with random seeds, and\nthe result shown is an average over these three runs. We do\nthis to capture the variance between different training steps,\nillustrated in Figure 3. The same is done when evaluating with\nthe modern games, except we only evaluate the ﬁnal model\ninstead of the last three epochs.\nThe evaluation results are reported as percentage of human\nscore [2], where 0% is a baseline score set by an agent that\npicks a random action on each frame, and 100% is the mean\nscore of the human players in the dataset used for training. In\nAtari experiments, we use the mean score of the episodes with\na score above the 95th percentile in the Atari Grand Challenge\ndataset [15] for average human score.\nB. Behavioural cloning model\nThe neural network model is based on the convolutional\nneural network used in the original deep Q-learning work\n[2] and in related BC experiments [14], consisting of three\nconvolutional layers, followed by a single fully connected\nlayer of 512 units and a layer that maps these to probabilities\nfor each action. All layers use ReLU (rectiﬁed linear unit)\nactivations. While small by modern standards, this architecture\nis the de facto architecture used in RL experiments [10], [34].\nResidual networks [35] have also been used for improved\nperformance [26], [36], but are slower to run.

All code is implemented in PyTorch.\nIn all of the experiments, the network is trained using\nthe Adam optimizer [37] to minimize cross-entropy, with a\nlearning rate of 0.001 and L2-normalization weight 10−5. In\nall experiments, we train until training loss does not improve.\nWe did not ﬁnd shorter or longer training to be helpful, and\nagent’s performance did not increase signiﬁcantly after ﬁrst\n10−50% of the training regimen (see Figure 3). Interestingly,\ntraining loss continues to reduce while evaluation performance\ndoes not change. This is expected to a degree, as the training\nloss (per-sample prediction error) does not reﬂect the agent’s\nperformance [38]. During evaluation, we sample the ﬁnal\nactions according to the probabilities provided by the network.\nWe found this to work better than deterministically selecting\nthe action with the highest probability.\nC. Atari games\nFor the Atari experiments, we used two existing datasets:\nthe Atari Grand Challenge dataset (Atari GC) [15] and the\nAtari-HEAD dataset [14]. The Atari Grand Challenge dataset\nincludes ﬁve games, which were all used for our experiments.\nThe Atari-HEAD dataset includes a set of 20 Atari games, out\nof which we used the three games that are also in the Atari\nGrand Challenge dataset. Atari-HEAD includes episodes with\nhigher score. A comparison of the distribution of ﬁnal scores\nin these two datasets can be seen in Figure 2.\nTo study effect of the amount and quality of the data on\nbehavioural cloning, we include experiments similar to ones in\n[15], where we repeat behavioural cloning only using episodes\nwith scores above the 95th percentile and 50th percentile (“top\n5%” and “top 50%”). It should be noted that we use only BC,\nwhile [15] used deep Q-learning from demonstrations [10].\nThe amount of data for all these setups are shown in Table I.\nIn both datasets, the input frames are 160×210 RGB images\nthat are resized to 84 × 84 when training the models. To\neliminate ﬂickering of certain in-game elements, each frame\nis merged with its preceding frame by setting each pixel to\nhave the lighter value from these two frames (maximum). The\nframe rate in both datasets is 60 frames per second.

Evaluation runs until the game ends or the\n40000th frame is reached.\nD. Doom\nFor the Doom experiments, we use two scenarios provided\nby the ViZDoom [33]: Health-Gathering-Supreme (HGS) and\nDeathmatch. In both scenarios the input observation is an RGB\nimage of size 80 × 60, and the network predicts which of\nthe allowed buttons are pressed down. Human gameplay is\nrecorded every other ViZDoom tick (17.5 frames per second),\nand the trained model takes actions at the same rate. We\ncollect data from three players, and train models for 30 epochs.\nEvaluation is done the same way as with the Atari experiments,\nexcept with 200 games per epoch.\nIn the HGS scenario, the player constantly takes damage,\nand must navigate around a small maze to collect med kits\nto survive longer. The longer the player survives, the higher\nthe score. Allowed buttons are TURN_LEFT, TURN_RIGHT\nand MOVE_FORWARD. The game ends when the player dies\nor a timeout (one minute) is reached. We record 20 full games\nper person, totaling around one hour of gameplay and 62615\nsamples.\nIn the Deathmatch scenario, the player is pitted against\na room of randomly spawning enemies, with a generous\nnumber of pickups and weapons on the sides of the levels.\nAllowed buttons are ATTACK, SPEED (hold down for faster\nmovement), TURN_LEFT, TURN_RIGHT, MOVE_FORWARD\nand MOVE_BACKWARD. The game ends when the player dies,\nor a timeout of two minutes is reached.

Modern video games\nAs for the experiments with modern video games (released\nafter 2010), we selected games that are familiar to players\nwho provide the data, and which do not require a mouse\nto play. The selected games are described in Appendix A,\nwith example images in Figure 1. We use a speciﬁcally built\ntool, ViControl, to capture the screen image, the corresponding\nkeyboard\/mouse input, and to later emulate these buttons to\nallow the agent to play the game. During recording, ViControl\nbehaves like any game recording\/streaming software, except\nit also tracks keypresses. We collect data from two players,\nwith 30 minutes of gameplay from both, totaling ≈72000\nframes of demonstration per game. Models were trained for\n30 epochs. The only pre-processing we apply is resizing the\nimage. Evaluation is done by letting the trained model play\nthe game until the game ends, the episode lasts too long, or\nwhen some other game-speciﬁc criteria is met.

General behavioural cloning performance\nFigure 4 shows the results for the model trained with\nboth Atari datasets. Ms. Pac-Man results show a fairly poor\nperformance of under 5% of human score. Video Pinball fails\nto achieve the baseline score set by a random agent. Q*bert,\nMontezuma’s Revenge and Space Invaders, however, reach a\nscore of over 20% of human score.\nThe results in Figure 5 show the performance of the two\nViZDoom scenarios as well as the modern video games. Out of\nthese, ViZDoom health gathering is the only one to achieve\na human normalized score of more than 30%, while others\nremain under 15%. Out of the modern video games, Binding\nof Isaac: Rebirth and BeamNG.drive are the only games that\nget a score signiﬁcantly above the baseline set by a random\nagent.\nDespite the low scores in most tested games, watching\nthe agents’ gameplay shows that the models still learn some\nof the basic dynamics of the games. See video available\nat https:\/\/youtu.be\/2SMLpnUEIPw. In Super Hexagon, the\nagent moves in the correct direction, but often overshoots or\nundershoots the correct position. In Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,\nthe agent moves through doors and shoots towards enemies\nand in BeamNG.drive, the agent accelerates and steers in the\ncorrect direction, but still hits the walls and damages the car\noften. In Boson X, agent learns to jump at the right moments,\nbut often jumps too short to reach the other platforms. In Crypt\nof the NecroDancer, the agent learns to hit nearby enemies and\nmove in the tunnels, but often throws away their weapon or\nkills themselves with a bomb.\nComparing our results with earlier BC experiments done\nby Hester et al. [10] and Zhang et al. [14] (Table II) we\nreached higher scores in all tested Atari games except for Ms.\nPac-Man, by adjusting for human action-delay and only using\nhigher quality data. The results in Kurin et al. [15] are not\ndirectly comparable, since they did not use a pure BC method.\nB.

X-axis represents the action-delay used while\ntraining the model, with positive meaning the action lags behind. E.g. delay of ﬁve means we move all actions ﬁve steps back in time, and associate with\ncorresponding observation.\nscore increases from just barely above the random agent’s\nperformance to over 20% of human score when using the top\n5% of episodes. Space Invaders gets a similar increase when\nmoving from the Atari Grand Challenge dataset to the Atari-\nHEAD dataset. Differences in Ms. Pac-Man are not signiﬁcant,\ngiven the small change and relatively large variance.\nTo further study the effect that the quantity of data has on\nthe results, we ran experiments with datasets that only con-\ntained the top 1, 2 and 3 episodes of the Atari Grand Challenge\ndataset. In many games the results were still comparable to\nresults shown here, considering the very small amount of data.\nFor example, Ms. Pac-Man got a score of 515 with just the\nbest two episodes (28330 samples) of the dataset. Training\nwith the entire dataset (2829068 samples) resulted in a score\nof 774. The score with the top two episodes of Space Invaders\n(20112 samples) was 193, while a model trained with the full\ndataset (4005345 samples) got a slightly lower score of 190\npoints. Q*bert score, however, dropped sharply when smaller\ndatasets than the top 5% were used. These results suggest that\neven a very small amount of high-quality data can result in a\ncomparatively well performing agent.\nFor Doom experiments, we trained models with each\nplayer’s data, as well as with all players’ data combined. On\nHGS (Health Gathering Supreme), an agent trained with the\ndata collected from one of the players achieved a slightly\nhigher score than the agent trained with all players’ combined\ndata. With the Deathmatch scenario, however, the agent trained\nwith the combined data reached a higher score than any of the\nagents trained with individual players’ data. We believe this\nis because of the complexity of the two scenarios: deathmatch\nhas a wide variety of different enemies and available weapons\nand items, so having more data is beneﬁcial. HGS is a more\nstraightforward scenario. Interestingly, despite all three players\nhad highest score possible in HGS in all of the recorded data,\nthe performance of trained agents varied between 4 and 11\naverage score, depending on which player’s data agent was\ntrained on. We believe this is because of the differences in\nhow different participants played the game.\nC. Action delay\nThe ﬁrst row of Figure 6 shows the action delay results\nfor the Atari Grand Challenge dataset. Q*bert, Montezuma’s\nRevenge and Space Invaders see a signiﬁcant increase in\nevaluation scores with positive action delay values, with the\nlargest increase seen when using a delay of ﬁve frames. Action\ndelay does not have a large effect with Ms. Pac-Man, apart\nfrom a large drop in ﬁnal score caused by delay values of\n−100 and 100. Video Pinball achieves the best performance\nwith zero action delay, although the score is still well below the\n0% mark set by the random agent. Results for Atari-HEAD\ndataset show smaller yet consistent improvements with two\nframe delay in Montezuma’s Revenge and Space Invaders.\nSame applies to both ViZDoom scenarios, where delay of two\nimproved the performance slightly over zero delay.\nWith the Atari games’ frame rate of 60, the delay of ﬁve\nframes (Atari-GC) corresponds to about 83 milliseconds of\ndelay, and two frames (Atari-HEAD) is about 33 milliseconds.\nOur ViZDoom datasets are collected at 17.5 frames per second,\nand delay of two frames corresponds to 114 milliseconds.\nThe differences between two Atari datasets reﬂect how Atari-\nHEAD was collected in a synchronous manner (game waited\nfor human to execute an action), with delay from observation\nto action being lower albeit not zero.\nV. CONCLUSION\nWe benchmarked end-to-end behavioural cloning in various\nvideo games and studied the effect of quality of expert data\nand the delay from human reaction time. Our results show that\nbehavioural cloning agents can learn basic mechanics\/rules of\nthe games (e.g. coherent movement) with a small amount of\ndata (one hour of human gameplay), but generally only achieve\nfraction of the performance of human players, and sometimes\neven worse than a random agent. We demonstrate how the\nquantity of the data matters less when only a limited amount of\ndata is available, and how adjusting for the human delay from\nobservations to actions (reﬂexes) improves the performance.\nBased on these results, we recommend using high-quality\ndata, rather than just large quantities of any data, for be-\nhavioural cloning. If data is gathered from human demon-\nstrators, we also recommend offsetting the recorded action\nby assigning them to observations 100ms earlier. This is to\ncounteract the state-action mismatch introduced by the delay\nfrom observations to actions.\nAs a future work, we would like to solve issues that still\nremain, e.g. using “super-resolution” networks to handle high-\ndeﬁnition images instead of resizing them, using recurrent\nnetworks and trying to avoid causal confusion [21]. A simple\nquestion remaining is also how far we can get with BC with a\nlarge amount of data, like in Starcraft II [6]. Going beyond BC,\nmethods like generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL)\n[39] and batch reinforcement learning [40] require simulations\nor reward signals but show improvements over behavioural\ncloning. All things considered, including successful applica-\ntions of reinforcement learning and the recent improvements in\nimitation learning, we remain hopeful for human-level agents\nin video games, despite the less-than-ideal results presented\nhere.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.

INTRODUCTION\nReinforcement learning (RL) [1] has been successfully\napplied to create super-human players in multiple video games,\nincluding classic Atari 2600 games [2], as well as more mod-\nern shooters [3], MOBAs [4], [5] and real-time strategy games\n[6]. Even more so, all before-mentioned accomplishments\nuse “end-to-end” systems, where input features are not pre-\nprocessed by crafting speciﬁc features, and instead rely on raw\ninformation like image pixels. However, RL is not without\nits limitations: they require an environment where to play\nthe game. Whether this is achieved by modifying an existing\ngame (like Starcraft II [7]) or by using their engines to create\nenvironments from ground-up (like Unity ML-Agents [8]), it\n*Equal contribution, alphabetical ordering.

Even worse, after the\nenvironment is created, training the agents may take thousands\nof years of in-game time [4], [6].\nAn alternative approach is imitation learning, in which\nagents learn to replicate demonstrators’ actions. Behavioural\ncloning (BC) [9] is the simplest form of this: given an\nobservation and an associated action from a demonstrator,\npredict this action based on observation (i.e a classiﬁcation\ntask). This has been used to kick-start RL agents [6], [10], but\nalso applied alone in e.g. autonomous driving [9], [11], [12],\nand Vinyals et al. [6] show that Starcraft II can be played at\nproﬁcient human-level with behavioural cloning alone. This\nbegs the question: How well can behavioural cloning play\nvideo games, in general? Can we reach the level of a human\nplayer? How much data do we need? Do we need data from\nmultiple players?\nIf we can create performant, end-to-end agents with BC\nand human gameplay alone, it would skip many hurdles\nexperienced with RL: we do not need to create an environment\nfor agents to play in, nor do we need to spend large amounts\nof compute resources for training. We only need the video\ngame, a tool to record the gameplay, and players for the game.\nIf BC can manage with just an hour or two of gameplay\ndemonstration, a single person could record the demonstration\ndata. If the recording tool captures the same output and input\na human player would have (i.e. image of the screen and\nkeyboard\/mouse, end-to-end), this would require no game-\nspeciﬁc coding and could be applied to any game. Even if\nBC does not reach human-level performance, it could still be\nused as a starting point for other learning methods, or as a\nsupport for diversifying the agent’s behaviour [6].\nVideo games have been in active use as benchmarks in\nresearch using BC [10], [13]–[15], and as milestones to beat\nin AI research [2], [5], [6]. The other way around, “BC for\nvideo games”, has seen works like human-like bots in ﬁrst-\nperson shooter (FPS) games using hand-crafted features and\nimitation learning [16]–[18], end-to-end FPS bots with RL and\nBC [19]. Our setting and motivation resemble the motivation\nof [20], where authors employ end-to-end imitation learning\nto play two Nintendo 64 games successfully. However, these\nstudies have been limited to only a few games a time, making it\nhard to tell how well BC performs in general at playing video\narXiv:2004.00981v2  [cs.AI]  18 May 2020\nFig. 1.\nGames tested with behavioural cloning.

Apart from [15], related work does not study how data\nshould be chosen for behavioural cloning. In addition, Zhang\net al. [14] bring up an important point on how human delay\ncan adversarially affect the quality of the dataset but did not\ninclude experimental results on this.\nIn this work, we aim to answer these three questions and\nto assess the general applicability of end-to-end behavioural\ncloning for video game playing. We use data from human\ndemonstrators to train a deep network to predict their actions,\ngiven the same observations human players saw (the screen\nimage). We run empirical experiments to study how well\nBC agents play Atari 2600 games, Doom (1993) and various\nmodern video games. Along with the raw performance, we\nstudy the effect of quality and quantity of the training data, and\nthe effect of delay of human reﬂexes on the data quality. Along\nthe results, we present ViControl (“Visual Control”), a multi-\nplatform tool to record and play an arbitrary game, which we\nuse to do behavioural cloning on the modern games. ViControl\nis available at https:\/\/github.com\/joonaspu\/ViControl.\nII. END-TO-END BEHAVIOURAL CLONING FOR VIDEO\nGAMES\nA. Behavioural cloning\nWe wish to train computer to play a game, based on given\ndemonstrations of humans playing it. We model the environ-\nment as a truncated version of Markov Decision Processes\n(MDPs) [1], where playing the game consists of observations\ns ∈S and associated actions a ∈A. We do not include a\nnotion of time, reward signal nor terminal\/initial states. The\ntask of behavioural cloning is simple: given a dataset of human\ngameplay D containing tuples (s, a), learn the conditional\ndistribution p(a|s), i.e. probability of human players picking\naction a in state s. After learning this distribution, we can\nuse it to play the game by sampling an action a ∼p(a|s) for\na given state s (agent). An immediate limitation here is the\nlack of temporal modelling, or “memory”, which could limit\nthe agent’s abilities. It has been shown that including past\ninformation with behavioural cloning can be detrimental to\nperformance [21], but on the other hand there exists work that\nsuccessfully do BC with recurrent neural networks [22]. We\nopt not to use recurrent networks for the model and training\nsimplicity, and as most of the games used in this work do not\nrequire memory to master.\nWe take an end-to-end approach, where states are pixels of\nan RGB image s ∈RH×W ×3, H, W ∈N, and actions a are\na vector of one or more discrete variables ai ∈0, 1, . . . di,\nwhere i ∈N represents the number of discrete variables, and\ndi tells the number of options per discrete variable. In Atari\nenvironments [23], action contains one discrete variable with\n18 options, including all possible choices human player could\nmake (multi-class classiﬁcation task). With a PC game using a\nkeyboard with, say, four buttons available, the actions consist\nof four discrete variables, all with two options: down or up\n(multi-label classiﬁcation task).\nTo model the conditional distribution p(a|s), we use deep\nneural networks. They support the different actions we could\nhave and are known to excel in image classiﬁcation tasks [24].\nWe treat action discrete variables i independent from each\nother, and the network is trained to minimize cross-entropy\nbetween predictions and labels in the dataset.\nB. Challenges of general end-to-end control of video games\nCompared to Atari 2600 games and Doom (1993), modern\nvideo games (published after 2010) can take advantage of more\ncomputing power and tend to be more complex when it comes\nto visual aesthetics and dynamics. We also do not assume to\nhave control over game program’s ﬂow, so the game will run\nat a ﬁxed rate, as humans would experience it. All-together,\nthese raise some speciﬁc challenges for generalized end-to-end\ncontrol, where we wish to avoid per-game engineering.\na) High resolution: Modern games commonly run at\n“high deﬁnition” resolutions, with most common monitor\nresolution for players being 1920×1080. However, RL and BC\nagents resize images to small resolutions due to computational\nefﬁciency, usually capped around 200 to 300 pixels per axis\n[3], [25], and commonly lower [2], [10]. If we take a modern\ngame with a resolution of at least 1280×720, and downscale it\nto these resolutions, we lose a great deal of detail: any smaller\nuser-interface (UI) elements, like text, may get blurred out, and\nalready-small objects on the screen may disappear completely.\nOn top of this, different interpolation methods used for resizing\nimages have been reported to affect the training results [20],\n[26]. We leave approaches for solving this to future work, and\nsimply resize the images.\nb) Complex action space: The natural action space of\na computer game, a keyboard and a mouse, contains over a\nhundred keys to press in total, as well as the movement of the\nmouse. Such large action spaces have shown to be an issue to\nRL agents [27], [28], and many of these buttons do nothing\nin games (when was the last time you have used Insert\nin a video game?). Even when we modify the action space to\nonly include buttons that are used by the game, we can end up\nwith a large, parametrized action space with its own difﬁculties\n[29], like in Starcraft II [7]. We pre-deﬁne a minimal set of\nactions required to play games in this work.\nc) Asynchronous execution: As the game environment\nruns asynchronously from the agent’s decisions, the agent must\nexecute an action quickly after observing an image, otherwise\nits decisions will lag behind. This “control delay” is known\nto reduce performance of RL methods [30], [31]. In addition,\nif we gather BC data from human players, the recorded ac-\ntions are subject to delays from human-reﬂexes. If something\nsurprising happens on the screen, average humans react to\nthis with a split-second delay. This action was supposed to\nbe associated with the surprising event, but instead it will be\nrecorded few frames later, associated with possibly a wrong\nobservation. Other way around, human players could plan\ntheir action before the observation and execute it pre-maturely.\nThese both lead to state-action mismatch [14], effect of which\nwe study in the experiments.\nd) Confounding information:\nBehavioural cloning is\nprone to causal confusion [21] or “superstition” [32], where\nproviding more information may be detrimental to BC\nagent’s performance. With more information (e.g. history,\npast frames\/actions), the model has a larger chance to ﬁnd\nmisleading correlations between observations and actions. For\nexample, ﬁring a plasma-weapon in Doom. This creates a\nblue, long-lasting muzzle-ﬂash on the weapon. Since many\nframes with ATTACK pressed down include this blue ﬂash,\nthe model learns to focus on this ﬂash to predict if we should\nﬁre the weapon. However, the ﬂash is not the cause of ﬁring\nthe weapon, it is the effect. Similarly, games have numerous\nUI elements with various information, which could lead to\nsimilar confusion. In this work we do not provide historical\ninformation to the agent, limiting its capabilities in exchange\nfor less chance of destructive causal confusion.\nIII. RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nAlong with the main evaluation of BC in different games,\nwe study two important aspects of the training setup, brought\nup by related work: “how does the quantity and quality of\nthe data affect the results?” [15], and “how the state-action\nmismatch from human reﬂexes affects the results?” [14]. The\nformer sheds light on if we should gather data from only few\nexperts, or should we use data from many different players.\nA similar comparison of different sized datasets was done in\n[15]. The latter was brought up by authors of [14], but without\nexperimental results.\n0\n20000\nScore\nDensity\nMs. Pac-Man\nAtari-HEAD\nAtari GC\n0\n20000 40000\nScore\nVideo Pinball\n0\n20000\nScore\nQ*bert\n0\n20000\n40000\nScore\nMontezuma's\nRevenge\n0\n2000\n4000\nScore\nSpace\nInvaders\nFig. 2.\nComparison of the score distribution in the Atari Grand Challenge\n(Atari-GC) dataset and in the Atari-HEAD dataset. Atari-HEAD does not have\ndata for Video Pinball or Q*bert\nTo study the state-action mismatch, we run experiments with\nmodiﬁed versions of the Atari and ViZDoom datasets, where\nan action delay d is added between the state and action. In\nthe modiﬁed datasets, the state si at frame i is matched with\nan action ai+d. Both positive and negative values are used for\nthe action delay d.\nWe will use Atari [23] and Doom [33] environments to\nanswer these questions, as they can be used synchronously\nand therefore allow fast evaluation of trained models. We will\nthen include six modern video games to assess how well BC\nworks under the challenges presented in Section II-B. Images\nof all of the games are shown in Figure 1. Code used to run\nthese experiments is available at https:\/\/github.com\/joonaspu\/\nvideo-game-behavioural-cloning.\nA. Evaluation\nFor the Atari and Doom experiments, each training run\nis evaluated by taking models from the three last epochs of\ntraining, evaluating their performance and averaging over. The\ntraining is then repeated three times with random seeds, and\nthe result shown is an average over these three runs. We do\nthis to capture the variance between different training steps,\nillustrated in Figure 3. The same is done when evaluating with\nthe modern games, except we only evaluate the ﬁnal model\ninstead of the last three epochs.\nThe evaluation results are reported as percentage of human\nscore [2], where 0% is a baseline score set by an agent that\npicks a random action on each frame, and 100% is the mean\nscore of the human players in the dataset used for training. In\nAtari experiments, we use the mean score of the episodes with\na score above the 95th percentile in the Atari Grand Challenge\ndataset [15] for average human score.\nB. Behavioural cloning model\nThe neural network model is based on the convolutional\nneural network used in the original deep Q-learning work\n[2] and in related BC experiments [14], consisting of three\nconvolutional layers, followed by a single fully connected\nlayer of 512 units and a layer that maps these to probabilities\nfor each action. All layers use ReLU (rectiﬁed linear unit)\nactivations. While small by modern standards, this architecture\nis the de facto architecture used in RL experiments [10], [34].\nResidual networks [35] have also been used for improved\nperformance [26], [36], but are slower to run. We opt for the\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9 10\nEpoch\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nLoss\nTraining loss\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9 10\nEpoch\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\nScore\nEvaluation score\nFig. 3.\nAn example of the training loss (left) and evaluation score curves\n(right).

All code is implemented in PyTorch.\nIn all of the experiments, the network is trained using\nthe Adam optimizer [37] to minimize cross-entropy, with a\nlearning rate of 0.001 and L2-normalization weight 10−5. In\nall experiments, we train until training loss does not improve.\nWe did not ﬁnd shorter or longer training to be helpful, and\nagent’s performance did not increase signiﬁcantly after ﬁrst\n10−50% of the training regimen (see Figure 3). Interestingly,\ntraining loss continues to reduce while evaluation performance\ndoes not change. This is expected to a degree, as the training\nloss (per-sample prediction error) does not reﬂect the agent’s\nperformance [38]. During evaluation, we sample the ﬁnal\nactions according to the probabilities provided by the network.\nWe found this to work better than deterministically selecting\nthe action with the highest probability.\nC. Atari games\nFor the Atari experiments, we used two existing datasets:\nthe Atari Grand Challenge dataset (Atari GC) [15] and the\nAtari-HEAD dataset [14]. The Atari Grand Challenge dataset\nincludes ﬁve games, which were all used for our experiments.\nThe Atari-HEAD dataset includes a set of 20 Atari games, out\nof which we used the three games that are also in the Atari\nGrand Challenge dataset. Atari-HEAD includes episodes with\nhigher score. A comparison of the distribution of ﬁnal scores\nin these two datasets can be seen in Figure 2.\nTo study effect of the amount and quality of the data on\nbehavioural cloning, we include experiments similar to ones in\n[15], where we repeat behavioural cloning only using episodes\nwith scores above the 95th percentile and 50th percentile (“top\n5%” and “top 50%”). It should be noted that we use only BC,\nwhile [15] used deep Q-learning from demonstrations [10].\nThe amount of data for all these setups are shown in Table I.\nIn both datasets, the input frames are 160×210 RGB images\nthat are resized to 84 × 84 when training the models. To\neliminate ﬂickering of certain in-game elements, each frame\nis merged with its preceding frame by setting each pixel to\nhave the lighter value from these two frames (maximum). The\nframe rate in both datasets is 60 frames per second.

Evaluation runs until the game ends or the\n40000th frame is reached.\nD. Doom\nFor the Doom experiments, we use two scenarios provided\nby the ViZDoom [33]: Health-Gathering-Supreme (HGS) and\nDeathmatch. In both scenarios the input observation is an RGB\nimage of size 80 × 60, and the network predicts which of\nthe allowed buttons are pressed down. Human gameplay is\nrecorded every other ViZDoom tick (17.5 frames per second),\nand the trained model takes actions at the same rate. We\ncollect data from three players, and train models for 30 epochs.\nEvaluation is done the same way as with the Atari experiments,\nexcept with 200 games per epoch.\nIn the HGS scenario, the player constantly takes damage,\nand must navigate around a small maze to collect med kits\nto survive longer. The longer the player survives, the higher\nthe score. Allowed buttons are TURN_LEFT, TURN_RIGHT\nand MOVE_FORWARD. The game ends when the player dies\nor a timeout (one minute) is reached. We record 20 full games\nper person, totaling around one hour of gameplay and 62615\nsamples.\nIn the Deathmatch scenario, the player is pitted against\na room of randomly spawning enemies, with a generous\nnumber of pickups and weapons on the sides of the levels.\nAllowed buttons are ATTACK, SPEED (hold down for faster\nmovement), TURN_LEFT, TURN_RIGHT, MOVE_FORWARD\nand MOVE_BACKWARD. The game ends when the player dies,\nor a timeout of two minutes is reached.

Modern video games\nAs for the experiments with modern video games (released\nafter 2010), we selected games that are familiar to players\nwho provide the data, and which do not require a mouse\nto play. The selected games are described in Appendix A,\nwith example images in Figure 1. We use a speciﬁcally built\ntool, ViControl, to capture the screen image, the corresponding\nkeyboard\/mouse input, and to later emulate these buttons to\nallow the agent to play the game. During recording, ViControl\nbehaves like any game recording\/streaming software, except\nit also tracks keypresses. We collect data from two players,\nwith 30 minutes of gameplay from both, totaling ≈72000\nframes of demonstration per game. Models were trained for\n30 epochs. The only pre-processing we apply is resizing the\nimage. Evaluation is done by letting the trained model play\nthe game until the game ends, the episode lasts too long, or\nwhen some other game-speciﬁc criteria is met. The ﬁnal score\nis an average over ten such games.\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n% of human score\nHealth Gathering\n(ViZDoom)\nDeathmatch\n(ViZDoom)\nDownwell\nCrypt of the\nNecroDancer\nSuper\nHexagon\nBoson X\nBinding of Isaac:\nRebirth\nBeamNG.drive\nFig. 5.

General behavioural cloning performance\nFigure 4 shows the results for the model trained with\nboth Atari datasets. Ms. Pac-Man results show a fairly poor\nperformance of under 5% of human score. Video Pinball fails\nto achieve the baseline score set by a random agent. Q*bert,\nMontezuma’s Revenge and Space Invaders, however, reach a\nscore of over 20% of human score.\nThe results in Figure 5 show the performance of the two\nViZDoom scenarios as well as the modern video games. Out of\nthese, ViZDoom health gathering is the only one to achieve\na human normalized score of more than 30%, while others\nremain under 15%. Out of the modern video games, Binding\nof Isaac: Rebirth and BeamNG.drive are the only games that\nget a score signiﬁcantly above the baseline set by a random\nagent.\nDespite the low scores in most tested games, watching\nthe agents’ gameplay shows that the models still learn some\nof the basic dynamics of the games. See video available\nat https:\/\/youtu.be\/2SMLpnUEIPw. In Super Hexagon, the\nagent moves in the correct direction, but often overshoots or\nundershoots the correct position. In Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,\nthe agent moves through doors and shoots towards enemies\nand in BeamNG.drive, the agent accelerates and steers in the\ncorrect direction, but still hits the walls and damages the car\noften. In Boson X, agent learns to jump at the right moments,\nbut often jumps too short to reach the other platforms. In Crypt\nof the NecroDancer, the agent learns to hit nearby enemies and\nmove in the tunnels, but often throws away their weapon or\nkills themselves with a bomb.\nComparing our results with earlier BC experiments done\nby Hester et al. [10] and Zhang et al. [14] (Table II) we\nreached higher scores in all tested Atari games except for Ms.\nPac-Man, by adjusting for human action-delay and only using\nhigher quality data. The results in Kurin et al. [15] are not\ndirectly comparable, since they did not use a pure BC method.\nB. Data quality versus quantity\nLooking more closely at the Atari results in Figure 4 we can\nsee that Q*bert and Space Invaders beneﬁt signiﬁcantly from\nhaving smaller but higher quality training datasets.

X-axis represents the action-delay used while\ntraining the model, with positive meaning the action lags behind. E.g. delay of ﬁve means we move all actions ﬁve steps back in time, and associate with\ncorresponding observation.\nscore increases from just barely above the random agent’s\nperformance to over 20% of human score when using the top\n5% of episodes. Space Invaders gets a similar increase when\nmoving from the Atari Grand Challenge dataset to the Atari-\nHEAD dataset. Differences in Ms. Pac-Man are not signiﬁcant,\ngiven the small change and relatively large variance.\nTo further study the effect that the quantity of data has on\nthe results, we ran experiments with datasets that only con-\ntained the top 1, 2 and 3 episodes of the Atari Grand Challenge\ndataset. In many games the results were still comparable to\nresults shown here, considering the very small amount of data.\nFor example, Ms. Pac-Man got a score of 515 with just the\nbest two episodes (28330 samples) of the dataset. Training\nwith the entire dataset (2829068 samples) resulted in a score\nof 774. The score with the top two episodes of Space Invaders\n(20112 samples) was 193, while a model trained with the full\ndataset (4005345 samples) got a slightly lower score of 190\npoints. Q*bert score, however, dropped sharply when smaller\ndatasets than the top 5% were used. These results suggest that\neven a very small amount of high-quality data can result in a\ncomparatively well performing agent.\nFor Doom experiments, we trained models with each\nplayer’s data, as well as with all players’ data combined. On\nHGS (Health Gathering Supreme), an agent trained with the\ndata collected from one of the players achieved a slightly\nhigher score than the agent trained with all players’ combined\ndata. With the Deathmatch scenario, however, the agent trained\nwith the combined data reached a higher score than any of the\nagents trained with individual players’ data. We believe this\nis because of the complexity of the two scenarios: deathmatch\nhas a wide variety of different enemies and available weapons\nand items, so having more data is beneﬁcial. HGS is a more\nstraightforward scenario. Interestingly, despite all three players\nhad highest score possible in HGS in all of the recorded data,\nthe performance of trained agents varied between 4 and 11\naverage score, depending on which player’s data agent was\ntrained on. We believe this is because of the differences in\nhow different participants played the game.\nC. Action delay\nThe ﬁrst row of Figure 6 shows the action delay results\nfor the Atari Grand Challenge dataset. Q*bert, Montezuma’s\nRevenge and Space Invaders see a signiﬁcant increase in\nevaluation scores with positive action delay values, with the\nlargest increase seen when using a delay of ﬁve frames. Action\ndelay does not have a large effect with Ms. Pac-Man, apart\nfrom a large drop in ﬁnal score caused by delay values of\n−100 and 100. Video Pinball achieves the best performance\nwith zero action delay, although the score is still well below the\n0% mark set by the random agent. Results for Atari-HEAD\ndataset show smaller yet consistent improvements with two\nframe delay in Montezuma’s Revenge and Space Invaders.\nSame applies to both ViZDoom scenarios, where delay of two\nimproved the performance slightly over zero delay.\nWith the Atari games’ frame rate of 60, the delay of ﬁve\nframes (Atari-GC) corresponds to about 83 milliseconds of\ndelay, and two frames (Atari-HEAD) is about 33 milliseconds.\nOur ViZDoom datasets are collected at 17.5 frames per second,\nand delay of two frames corresponds to 114 milliseconds.\nThe differences between two Atari datasets reﬂect how Atari-\nHEAD was collected in a synchronous manner (game waited\nfor human to execute an action), with delay from observation\nto action being lower albeit not zero.\nV. CONCLUSION\nWe benchmarked end-to-end behavioural cloning in various\nvideo games and studied the effect of quality of expert data\nand the delay from human reaction time. Our results show that\nbehavioural cloning agents can learn basic mechanics\/rules of\nthe games (e.g. coherent movement) with a small amount of\ndata (one hour of human gameplay), but generally only achieve\nfraction of the performance of human players, and sometimes\neven worse than a random agent. We demonstrate how the\nquantity of the data matters less when only a limited amount of\ndata is available, and how adjusting for the human delay from\nobservations to actions (reﬂexes) improves the performance.\nBased on these results, we recommend using high-quality\ndata, rather than just large quantities of any data, for be-\nhavioural cloning. If data is gathered from human demon-\nstrators, we also recommend offsetting the recorded action\nby assigning them to observations 100ms earlier. This is to\ncounteract the state-action mismatch introduced by the delay\nfrom observations to actions.\nAs a future work, we would like to solve issues that still\nremain, e.g. using “super-resolution” networks to handle high-\ndeﬁnition images instead of resizing them, using recurrent\nnetworks and trying to avoid causal confusion [21]. A simple\nquestion remaining is also how far we can get with BC with a\nlarge amount of data, like in Starcraft II [6]. Going beyond BC,\nmethods like generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL)\n[39] and batch reinforcement learning [40] require simulations\nor reward signals but show improvements over behavioural\ncloning. All things considered, including successful applica-\ntions of reinforcement learning and the recent improvements in\nimitation learning, we remain hopeful for human-level agents\nin video games, despite the less-than-ideal results presented\nhere.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.

Can you ﬁnd the box\nlabelled by the name Samu Entropy in this picture?\nthe game is lagging and, ﬁnally, it is also possible that the players have no\nsuﬃcient experience to control the character. In this paper, we introduce our\nbenchmark computer program called BrainB Test Series 6 that can abstract\nthis feeling. In this test, game objects are symbolized by boxes as it can be seen\nin Fig 1. All boxes move according to random walks. There is a distinguished\nbox labelled by the name Samu Entropy. It represents the character controlled\nby the player.\nThe benchmark test lasts for 10 minutes.\nDuring the test,\nthe user must continuously hold and drag the mouse button on the center of\nSamu Entropy. If the user succeeds in this task then the benchmark program\nwill increase the visual complexity of the display. It will draw more and more\noverlapping boxes which will move faster and faster. Otherwise, if the mouse\npointer cannot follow the center of Samu Entropy then the visual complexity\nwill be decreased. The test will delete more and more boxes and the remaining\nboxes move slower and slower until the user ﬁnds Samu Entropy again, i.e.,\nclicks on Samu Entropy.\nThe BrainB Series 1 to 4 were developed in the family setting of the ﬁrst\nauthor1. Then, in our university environment, we had already done a prelimi-\nnary study [BBP+18] on a previous (BrainB Series 5) version of our benchmark.\nSome of its measurements were streamed live on Twitch2. The main research\ngoal of this study is to show that players lose the character on a higher com-\nplexity level of the display and they ﬁnd it on a relatively lower complexity\nlevel.\nThe organization of the paper is the following. In the next section, we give\na brief overview of the psychological and informatics background and the phe-\nnomenon of losing the character is illustrated. The second section presents the\nalgorithm and the operation of our benchmark program including the presen-\ntation of the ﬁrst measurements followed by systematic measurements. Finally,\nwe conclude our paper and show some future plans.\n1For example, see https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/videos\/139186614\n2For example, see https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/videos\/206478952\n2\n1.1\nPsychological Background\nThe cognitive ability of attention is a signiﬁcant factor in everyday life, either\nit comes from work, hobby or the daily activities, as it aﬀects the performance\nof all the previously mentioned things. The alertness, or in other words, the\nlong upheld attention, in technical terms is called vigilance. The research of\nvigilance is an important topic in Psychology from 1970 to the present day. The\nﬁrst method used was the Mackworth Clock [Mac48], in which the participants\nhad to pay attention to a clock that had a second hand which sometimes sprang\ntwice, and then the participants had to signal as soon as possible. For measuring\nattention and concentration, there is another method, the Toulouse-Piéron test\n[TP13], in which participants have to follow a given scheme to separate right\nand wrong signs. To measure vigilance we must take into consideration the hit\nratio and the number of false alarms. In almost all of our activities there are\nalso interfering stimuli that aﬀects our performance as well. These other factors\nvary by quantity and quality, and some can be stimulating, while some detain\nus from the optimal performance. The Yerkes-Dodson law [YD08] says that for\nachieving the best performance there is an optimal arousal level, which level is\nhigher in simpler tasks, and lower in complex activities. It can be represented\nby a inverted U-shaped curve. We must not forget that as in some other things,\nin the attentional system there are also personal diﬀerences that should be taken\ninto consideration while researching the subject [CGR07].\nOther objects in the environment can aﬀect how we perceive the one object\nthat is interesting for us. In 1940, Witkin et al. did a research on perception\n[WLH+54], and from this work, they created a theory about two diﬀerent cog-\nnitive styles, which they called ﬁeld dependent, and ﬁeld independent. A ﬁeld\ndependent person perception is mainly aﬀected by the ﬁeld, the environment\nof the observed object. On the contrary, a ﬁeld independent person does not\naﬀected by the ﬁeld created by the observed object’s environment. This phe-\nnomenon was investigated by a task, in which the participants had to determine\nwhether a straight rod, in diﬀerent planes is vertical or not. Moreover, there\nis another typical method used in this topic, that is the Tilting room, Tilting\nchair test, in which the participant is sitting in a tiltable chair that he or she\nneeds to controll in order to get him\/herself into vertical position despite the\ntilting room. Later, Witkin and Goodenough reinvestigated the topic, and they\ncame to a conclusion that the two styles are two ends of the spectrum, however,\nsome people are ﬁxed with one of the cognitive styles, while others can adapt\nto the style they use depending on the situation [AWRG76].\nSpeaking of attention, it’s important to talk about the main processing sys-\ntem, i.e., the brain. The operation of the brain is frequently compared to the\nmechanism of a personal computer by many researchers. Carl Sagan based his\ntheory on the binary coding, so he used the information content in binary. When\nwe are watching something, the picture seen that our brain maps, is made of\nplenty of information. Sagan wanted to calculate the information processing\nspeed of the brain, to do so, he based his calculation on the example of looking\nat the moon, and from this example he drew the consequence, that the brain\ncan process about 5000 bit\/sec at its peak performance [Sag12]. In a modern\nproject, called Building 8, the main thought is to make the brain into a com-\nputer. Based on this project, the information processing speed of the brain is\nabout a terrabyte\/sec, which far exceeds the speed estimated by Sagan [Nie17].\n3\n1.1.1\nPracticing ﬁlling out tests\nFilling out tests and experiments are common tools in the science of psychology.\nCountless methods were created to date, but these methods are not just used,\nbecause researchers improve them, as well as, try to test them in a wider range.\nHowever, we need to consider certain factors in each experiment and test that\nhow they aﬀect the method’s usability and the ﬁnal results as well. Among\nthese factors, there is one, when the participant obtains knowledge about what\nis expected from her\/him, or which answer are considered the ’best’. This way\nthe participant will accomodate to this information, because he\/she, as everyone\nelse, wants to portray herself\/himself in the best manner possible and to be the\n’best’ in performance. In multiple choice questions, there are some tricks, that\nare well known in the common knowledge, which we all use, when we don’t know\nthe right answer for sure. A somewhat similar tool is the experience or routine\nwith ﬁlling out tests, which can help to choose the adequate strategy for solving\nthe situation, this is called test-wisdom. To achieve that, one must discover the\nlogic behind the method, or practise it many times. But the test-wisdom often\ncause inconvenience for test developers, because they have to keep in mind a\nbonus factor, which is totally diverge from the basic variables they meant to\nmanipulate, and vary in each individual [RSA06].\nThe eﬀect of being experienced in ﬁlling in tests was studied in a research,\nin which an aptitude test called GRE (Grand Record Examination) was used.\nPractise samples were sent to random participants 5 weeks before the exam-\nination. Those who got these samples also receieved advices for completing.\nIn conclusion, the group with prior knowledge and practise earned signiﬁcantly\nbetter results in the examination. Furthermore, there were also a notable growth\nin points, when the participants received an only 4 hours educational practise\nbefore the examination. It’s important to note that this diﬀerence and growth\nwas present only in the logical reasoning part of the exam, and not in the math-\nematical and verbal parts [PS84].\nThis data was reexamined later, because\nresearchers wanted to know, if there is any diﬀerence when the existing groups\nwould be split into subgroups by the diﬀerent attributes of the participants. As a\nconclusion, there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the subgroups, but there\nwas a notable diﬀerence in the group in which the members’ primary language\nwas not English, they scored lesser points than the others [Pow86].\nRepeatedly performing the same experiment or test with the same partici-\npants could aﬀect the results. Previously, as we speciﬁed, repeatedly using the\nsame method could cause the lowering of its validity, and the results could be\ndistorted. Participants can learn and adapt to certain methods, even if its just\nmeans a small percentage of diﬀerence. The current test takes 10 minutes to\ncomplete, in this 10 minutes the participant’s full attention and concentration\nis needed. We should keep in mind, that the negative eﬀects of fatigue could\nbalance the positive eﬀects of practise, in a direct way of repeated examinations.\nSo this two factors should be considered in the evaulation, and while drawing\nconsequence.\nIt is therefore proposed to perform our benchmark test in a competitive way\ntrying to beat friends, family members, colleagues or ourselves.\n4\n1.2\nInformatics Background\nSince computer games have a relatively short history and their eﬀects on cog-\nnitive skills have just been started to be researched recently, there are plenty\nof questions to be answered. In [HPR+18], authors reported an increase in ex-\necutive functions in school students after playing computer games. Moisala et\nal. in [MSH+17] shows that enhancements in speed and performance accuracy\nof working memory tasks is related to daily gaming activity.\nIn [BAM+18],\nauthors present an analysis of the impact of action video games on cognitive\nskills.\nUsing computer games to measure cognitive abilities has a short history, but\na promising future. Most research try to measure the presence or severity of a\ncertain cognitive disease such as dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. In [ABR+13],\nauthors show how a long-term use of video games can reduce multitasking costs\nin older adults. Geyer et al. in [GIF+15] show that the change of the score of an\nonline game is in connection with the age-related changes in working memory.\nSeldom can we ﬁnd applications that has been developed for the measure-\nment of cognitive abilities. One such application is reported in [PHC15b] and\n[PHC15a], it is a framework that has been developed to measure cognitive abil-\nities and its change of elders with computer games. This framework is able to\nlog and analyze scores achieved in various online computer games.\nFrom the viewpoint of information theory and HCI (Human-Computer In-\nteraction), the Hick’s law [Seo05] could be an interesting aspect. This law states\nthat the response time of the brain increases with logarithm of the size of the\ninput. For our purposes, it can be an interesting question: how can we apply\nthe Hick’s law (or other information theory ﬁgure) in our benchmark software?\n1.3\nLosing The Character\nWe have experienced the feeling of losing the character during playing several\ngames like for example League of Legends3, Clash of Clans4, Clash Royale5,\nHeroes of the Storm6, Dota 27, World of Warcraft8 or Cabal9.\nNow we share our thoughts about the phenomenon of „losing the character”,\nand give some examples to illustrate it from the game called League of Legends.\nBasically, a match starts kind of slowly and quietly: the laners are farming, as\nwell as the junglers in their own territory. Of course smaller ﬁghts can occur\nin the early stages of the game, like a 1v1 in the solo lanes, or a 3v3 in the\nbottom lane as both of the junglers decides to gank, but these situations are\nrelatively easy to see through. As we head into the mid and late game, teams\nstart ﬁghts more often with more people, even with all of them. This is what\nwe call teamﬁghts. These are harder to handle, because a lot of things can\nappear on our screen at the same time: the champions who participate in the\nﬁght, optionally minions or jungle monsters, and the visual eﬀects of the spells,\nsummoner spells, and the active or passive abilities of the items. Besides them,\n3https:\/\/na.leagueoflegends.com\n4http:\/\/supercell.com\/en\/games\/clashofclans\/\n5http:\/\/supercell.com\/en\/games\/clashroyale\/\n6https:\/\/heroesofthestorm.com\n7https:\/\/www.dota2.com\n8https:\/\/worldofwarcraft.com\n9http:\/\/cabal.playthisgame.com\n5\nwe see a lot of things, we still have to make sure that we fulﬁll our ingame\nrole properly: position well, attack the proper target, or defend our teammates.\nWe have to handle a lot of information at a blink of an eye, so it is completely\nnatural, that sometimes we do not know where to look at or what to do. We can\nlose our own character, which can end with our death; we can lose the target\ncharacter, and it can survive; or we can lose the character that we wanted to\nprotect, thus an important member of the team can die. This can be a short\nexplanation of the phenomenon, which we can also call „losing the focus”.\nAn example ingame footage can be viewed at https:\/\/youtu.be\/wdy3KUm1454,\nstarting at 2:12.\nThese situations are one of the hardest parts of the game, and it is not\neasy to handle them well. The easiest way to prepare for them is to play a\nlot of games, and get experience in them. Also it can help a lot, if we think\nahead before a potential teamﬁght, e.g. which character will be our target, who\nshould we be afraid of, what summoner spells the enemy still has, etc. All of\nthese things can help to execute the ﬁghts more properly.\n2\nBrain Benchmarking Series 6\nBrainB is a Qt C++ desktop application that uses the OpenCV library. It is\ndeveloped as an open source project that is available on GitHub [B´17]. Its source\ncan be built easily on GNU\/Linux systems. But the latest (6.0.3) Windows\nbinary release can also be downloaded as a ZIP ﬁle from http:\/\/smartcity.\ninf.unideb.hu\/~norbi\/BrainBSeries6\/.\nIt is important to show the algorithm of BrainB as precise as possible because\nthe randomness plays a key role in its operation due to boxes doing random\nwalks.\nThe code snippet shown in Listing 1 is the heart of our benchmark\nprogram. It is a simpliﬁed version of the original source code that can be found\nin the GitHub repository at https:\/\/github.com\/nbatfai\/esport-talent-\nsearch\/blob\/master\/BrainBWin.cpp#L65. This code is executed at every 100\nmilliseconds that is ten times per second. First, as shown in Line 1, it computes\nthe distance between the mouse pointer and the center of the box of Samu\nEntropy and the result is stored in the variable called dist that holds the square\nof the Euclidean distance. If the distance is larger than 121 pixels (11 is the\nsquare root of 121) and if it reoccurs 12 consecutive times or more in a row (that\nmeans at least a time interval of 1.2 seconds) and it is also true that the player\nwas controlling the character well in the previous time slices (that is in Line 10\nthe state is equal to found) then we say that the user has lost the character\nSamu Entropy and the visual complexity of the display will be saved in Line 12.\nThe sequence of these losing values and the symmetrical ﬁnding values saved in\nLine 28 are shown in Fig 2. The complexity is computed in bits per second (bps)\nunits that is based on the number of changed pixels between two consecutive\nrectangular environments of the character with a given width and height.\nListing 1: The algorithm for administration of losing and ﬁnding the character.\n1 int\ndist = ( this ->mouse_x\n- x ) * ( this ->mouse_x\n- x )\n2\n+ ( this ->mouse_y\n- y ) * ( this ->mouse_y\n- y );\n3\n4 if ( dist > 121 )\n5\n{\n6\n++ nofLost;\n6\n7\nnofFound = 0;\n8\nif ( nofLost\n> 12 )\n9\n{\n10\nif ( state == found &&\nfirstLost )\n11\n{\n12\nfound2lost.push_back(brainBThread ->get_bps ());\n13\n}\n14\nfirstLost = true;\n15\nstate = lost;\n16\nnofLost = 0;\n17\nbrainBThread ->decComp ();\n18\n}\n19\n}\n20 else\n21\n{\n22\n++ nofFound;\n23\nnofLost = 0;\n24\nif ( nofFound\n> 12 )\n25\n{\n26\nif ( state == lost &&\nfirstLost )\n27\n{\n28\nlost2found.push_back(brainBThread ->get_bps ());\n29\n}\n30\nstate = found;\n31\nnofFound = 0;\n32\nbrainBThread ->incComp ();\n33\n}\n34\n}\nThe ﬁnal result printed by the benchmark after it ends in the form “U R\nabout 5.92902 Kilobytes” is the mean of upper bounds for the bps values of the\ndisplay measured when the variable state changes from found to lost (in Listing\n1 from Line 10 to 14) and vice versa, when the variable state changes from lost\nto found (in Listing 1 from Lines 26 to 30). The simple calculation of this ﬁnal\nresult is shown in Listing 2.\nListing 2: The calculation of the ﬁnal result of the benchmark that is produced\nin a text ﬁle that is saved in the folder where the benchmark was started.\n1\nint m1 = mean ( lost2found\n);\n2\nint m2 = mean ( found2lost\n);\n3\n4\ndouble\nres = ( ( ( ( double ) m1\n5\n+ ( double ) m2 ) \/2.0 ) \/8.0 ) \/1024.0;\n6\n7\ntextStream\n<< \"U␣R␣about␣\" << res\n<< \"␣Kilobytes\\n\";\n2.1\nFirst Measurements\nAs concluded in our former preliminary study [BBP+18], one of the further de-\nvelopments of Series 5 is changing to full screen from ﬁxed-size window. This\nmodiﬁcation aﬀects the basic operation of the benchmark, so the ﬁrst objective\nwas to verify that whether the feeling of losing the character still appears cor-\nrectly or not. On Windows systems there were no problems. Some experiments\nusing default settings on Windows 10 can be seen in Fig 3, Fig 4 and Fig 5.\nBut on GNU\/Linux systems test subjects reported that the feeling of losing\nthe character is not experienced. These observations will be detailed in a next\nsection.\n2.2\nLogging Data\nThe state of the BrainB benchmark can be saved at any time by pressing the S\nbutton but measured data is automatically saved after the test is ﬁnished.

The\nreason for this is that even the standard test requires a constant focus of 10\nminutes, which can put a lot of pressure on one’s eyes. To ease this strain as\nmuch as we possibly could, we took lots of things into account. Firstly, we tried\nto maximize the contrast between the background and the ﬁgures. This means\nthat we picked some colors that could be easily distinguished and then we ran\nsome manual tests. The result was a signiﬁcant drop in the overall burden of\nthe eyes.\nAfter this, we thought about how we could make the benchmark available\nfor a wider range of people, namely for those who suﬀer from parachromatism\nor even disambiguation. This is rather important as it is said that roughly 8%\nof men and 0.5% of women10 suﬀer from one of these. In order for them to be\nable to comfortably run our benchmark, we tried to pick colors that are easily\ndistinguishable even for these people.\nAnother problem was that we did not target a speciﬁc age group. On the\ncontrary, we were especially curious about the results of adults, adolescents,\nteenagers and children. Therefore, we needed to pick a color scheme that was\nmodern, vivid, yet not too complex and not too abstract. This, too, required a\nlot of experimentation.\n2.4\nKnown Problems with Series 6\nDespite that our benchmark is developed on Linux it is surprising that test\nsubjects who performed it on Linux did not experience the feeling of losing\n10http:\/\/www.color-blindness.com\/2006\/04\/28\/colorblind-population\n12\nthe character. This problem causes the deteriorated results shown in Fig 6.\nIt is important to note that it has not been detected in earlier series of the\napplication. Moreover, before Series 6, there was no Windows binary edition of\nBrainB program. In Series 6, changing to full screen from windowed causes the\nproblem because Series 6 is sensitive to the diﬀerent mouse sensitivity settings on\nWindows and Linux systems (the measurements shown in Fig 6 were performed\nwith a Logitech mouse with acceleration: 5\/1 and threshold: 5 xset m11 setting).\nA short-term solution may be to standardize the test environment used by each\nmember of a given subset of test subjects. We apply this method to perform\nsystematic measurements with Series 6 in the next section.\nThe long-term\nsolution will be to ﬁne-tune the control of movements of boxes that is hardwired\ninto the Series 6 from Series 5 at this moment. Another possibility is to take\nthe liberty of ﬁne-tuning of the mouse for test subjects who thus would be able\nto choose their custom mouse settings in order to increase their eﬀectiveness.\nThis is also in well accordance with the competitive way of performing our test.\nFig 7 presents two measurements using custom mouse settings.\n2.5\nSystematic Measurements with Series 6\nThe BrainB Series 6 was measured in two groups:\nUDPROG and DEAC-\nHackers. The ﬁrst one is a Facebook community of over 550 actual or former\nstudents of the BSc course of “High Level Programming Languages” at the Uni-\nversity of Debrecen. The second one is an esport department of the University\nof Debrecen’s Athletic Club. Participation in the BrainB Series 6 survey was\nvoluntary in both groups.\nIn the UDPROG community 33 members send back their results including\nthe PNG screenshot and the produced text ﬁle within 2 days from the date of\nannouncement (20 August 2018). The arithmetic mean of the ﬁnal results of\nUDPROG participants is 4.95345. The mean of the number of boxes at the\nmoment when the benchmark ends is 57.1818. The averaged losing and ﬁnding\ncurve for all members is shown in Fig 8a. At the end of the curve the arithmetic\nmean values of complexity of the losing and ﬁnding events are irrelevant because\nthe size of the sequences of losing and ﬁnding events are diﬀerent for every\nparticipants. Fig 8b indicates these diﬀerent sizes.\nIn the DEAC-Hackers community 12 esport athletes have sent back their\nresults that can be seen in Fig 9. It is important to notice that despite low\nsample sizes of test subjects the averaged losing and ﬁnding curves shown in\nFig 8a and 9a have already separated the losing and ﬁnding events.\n3\nConclusion\nOur research hypothesis was that the mean of the complexity of changing lost\nto found is less than the mean of the changing found to lost. Fig 8a and 9a show\nthe fulﬁllment of this hypothesis. It seems very well in these ﬁgures that the\naveraged losing and ﬁnding curve has precisely separated the losing and ﬁnding\nevents.\nIntuitively, this result shows that we lose the character on a higher\ncomplexity level then we ﬁnd it on a relatively lower level again. This simple\nhypothesis has been proved by the results of this study.\n11https:\/\/www.x.org\/archive\/X11R7.7\/doc\/man\/man1\/xset.1.xhtml\n13\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n0\n10000\n20000\n30000\n40000\n50000\n60000\nIndex\nbps\n(a) The test subject was the same as\nin the experiment shown in Fig 3.

The main reasons for this\nfeeling may be due to the interplay of the following factors: (1) the visual\ncomplexity of the game is unexpectedly increased compared with the previous\ntime period as more and more game objects and effects are rendered on the\ndisplay; (2) and\/or the game is lagging; (3) and finally, it is also possible\nthat the players have no sufficient experience with controlling the character.\nThis paper focuses on the first reason. We have developed a benchmark program\nwhich allows its user to experience the feeling of losing character. While the\nuser can control the character well the benchmark program will increase the\nvisual complexity of the display. Otherwise, if the user lost the character\nthen the program will decrease the complexity until the user will find the\ncharacter again, and so on. The complexity is measured based on the number of\nchanged pixels between two consecutive display images. Our measurements show\nthat the average of bit per second values of losing and finding pairs describes\nthe user well.

Can you ﬁnd the box\nlabelled by the name Samu Entropy in this picture?\nthe game is lagging and, ﬁnally, it is also possible that the players have no\nsuﬃcient experience to control the character. In this paper, we introduce our\nbenchmark computer program called BrainB Test Series 6 that can abstract\nthis feeling. In this test, game objects are symbolized by boxes as it can be seen\nin Fig 1. All boxes move according to random walks. There is a distinguished\nbox labelled by the name Samu Entropy. It represents the character controlled\nby the player.\nThe benchmark test lasts for 10 minutes.\nDuring the test,\nthe user must continuously hold and drag the mouse button on the center of\nSamu Entropy. If the user succeeds in this task then the benchmark program\nwill increase the visual complexity of the display. It will draw more and more\noverlapping boxes which will move faster and faster. Otherwise, if the mouse\npointer cannot follow the center of Samu Entropy then the visual complexity\nwill be decreased. The test will delete more and more boxes and the remaining\nboxes move slower and slower until the user ﬁnds Samu Entropy again, i.e.,\nclicks on Samu Entropy.\nThe BrainB Series 1 to 4 were developed in the family setting of the ﬁrst\nauthor1. Then, in our university environment, we had already done a prelimi-\nnary study [BBP+18] on a previous (BrainB Series 5) version of our benchmark.\nSome of its measurements were streamed live on Twitch2. The main research\ngoal of this study is to show that players lose the character on a higher com-\nplexity level of the display and they ﬁnd it on a relatively lower complexity\nlevel.\nThe organization of the paper is the following. In the next section, we give\na brief overview of the psychological and informatics background and the phe-\nnomenon of losing the character is illustrated. The second section presents the\nalgorithm and the operation of our benchmark program including the presen-\ntation of the ﬁrst measurements followed by systematic measurements. Finally,\nwe conclude our paper and show some future plans.\n1For example, see https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/videos\/139186614\n2For example, see https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/videos\/206478952\n2\n1.1\nPsychological Background\nThe cognitive ability of attention is a signiﬁcant factor in everyday life, either\nit comes from work, hobby or the daily activities, as it aﬀects the performance\nof all the previously mentioned things. The alertness, or in other words, the\nlong upheld attention, in technical terms is called vigilance. The research of\nvigilance is an important topic in Psychology from 1970 to the present day. The\nﬁrst method used was the Mackworth Clock [Mac48], in which the participants\nhad to pay attention to a clock that had a second hand which sometimes sprang\ntwice, and then the participants had to signal as soon as possible. For measuring\nattention and concentration, there is another method, the Toulouse-Piéron test\n[TP13], in which participants have to follow a given scheme to separate right\nand wrong signs. To measure vigilance we must take into consideration the hit\nratio and the number of false alarms. In almost all of our activities there are\nalso interfering stimuli that aﬀects our performance as well. These other factors\nvary by quantity and quality, and some can be stimulating, while some detain\nus from the optimal performance. The Yerkes-Dodson law [YD08] says that for\nachieving the best performance there is an optimal arousal level, which level is\nhigher in simpler tasks, and lower in complex activities. It can be represented\nby a inverted U-shaped curve. We must not forget that as in some other things,\nin the attentional system there are also personal diﬀerences that should be taken\ninto consideration while researching the subject [CGR07].\nOther objects in the environment can aﬀect how we perceive the one object\nthat is interesting for us. In 1940, Witkin et al. did a research on perception\n[WLH+54], and from this work, they created a theory about two diﬀerent cog-\nnitive styles, which they called ﬁeld dependent, and ﬁeld independent. A ﬁeld\ndependent person perception is mainly aﬀected by the ﬁeld, the environment\nof the observed object. On the contrary, a ﬁeld independent person does not\naﬀected by the ﬁeld created by the observed object’s environment. This phe-\nnomenon was investigated by a task, in which the participants had to determine\nwhether a straight rod, in diﬀerent planes is vertical or not. Moreover, there\nis another typical method used in this topic, that is the Tilting room, Tilting\nchair test, in which the participant is sitting in a tiltable chair that he or she\nneeds to controll in order to get him\/herself into vertical position despite the\ntilting room. Later, Witkin and Goodenough reinvestigated the topic, and they\ncame to a conclusion that the two styles are two ends of the spectrum, however,\nsome people are ﬁxed with one of the cognitive styles, while others can adapt\nto the style they use depending on the situation [AWRG76].\nSpeaking of attention, it’s important to talk about the main processing sys-\ntem, i.e., the brain. The operation of the brain is frequently compared to the\nmechanism of a personal computer by many researchers. Carl Sagan based his\ntheory on the binary coding, so he used the information content in binary. When\nwe are watching something, the picture seen that our brain maps, is made of\nplenty of information. Sagan wanted to calculate the information processing\nspeed of the brain, to do so, he based his calculation on the example of looking\nat the moon, and from this example he drew the consequence, that the brain\ncan process about 5000 bit\/sec at its peak performance [Sag12]. In a modern\nproject, called Building 8, the main thought is to make the brain into a com-\nputer. Based on this project, the information processing speed of the brain is\nabout a terrabyte\/sec, which far exceeds the speed estimated by Sagan [Nie17].\n3\n1.1.1\nPracticing ﬁlling out tests\nFilling out tests and experiments are common tools in the science of psychology.\nCountless methods were created to date, but these methods are not just used,\nbecause researchers improve them, as well as, try to test them in a wider range.\nHowever, we need to consider certain factors in each experiment and test that\nhow they aﬀect the method’s usability and the ﬁnal results as well. Among\nthese factors, there is one, when the participant obtains knowledge about what\nis expected from her\/him, or which answer are considered the ’best’. This way\nthe participant will accomodate to this information, because he\/she, as everyone\nelse, wants to portray herself\/himself in the best manner possible and to be the\n’best’ in performance. In multiple choice questions, there are some tricks, that\nare well known in the common knowledge, which we all use, when we don’t know\nthe right answer for sure. A somewhat similar tool is the experience or routine\nwith ﬁlling out tests, which can help to choose the adequate strategy for solving\nthe situation, this is called test-wisdom. To achieve that, one must discover the\nlogic behind the method, or practise it many times. But the test-wisdom often\ncause inconvenience for test developers, because they have to keep in mind a\nbonus factor, which is totally diverge from the basic variables they meant to\nmanipulate, and vary in each individual [RSA06].\nThe eﬀect of being experienced in ﬁlling in tests was studied in a research,\nin which an aptitude test called GRE (Grand Record Examination) was used.\nPractise samples were sent to random participants 5 weeks before the exam-\nination. Those who got these samples also receieved advices for completing.\nIn conclusion, the group with prior knowledge and practise earned signiﬁcantly\nbetter results in the examination. Furthermore, there were also a notable growth\nin points, when the participants received an only 4 hours educational practise\nbefore the examination. It’s important to note that this diﬀerence and growth\nwas present only in the logical reasoning part of the exam, and not in the math-\nematical and verbal parts [PS84].\nThis data was reexamined later, because\nresearchers wanted to know, if there is any diﬀerence when the existing groups\nwould be split into subgroups by the diﬀerent attributes of the participants. As a\nconclusion, there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the subgroups, but there\nwas a notable diﬀerence in the group in which the members’ primary language\nwas not English, they scored lesser points than the others [Pow86].\nRepeatedly performing the same experiment or test with the same partici-\npants could aﬀect the results. Previously, as we speciﬁed, repeatedly using the\nsame method could cause the lowering of its validity, and the results could be\ndistorted. Participants can learn and adapt to certain methods, even if its just\nmeans a small percentage of diﬀerence. The current test takes 10 minutes to\ncomplete, in this 10 minutes the participant’s full attention and concentration\nis needed. We should keep in mind, that the negative eﬀects of fatigue could\nbalance the positive eﬀects of practise, in a direct way of repeated examinations.\nSo this two factors should be considered in the evaulation, and while drawing\nconsequence.\nIt is therefore proposed to perform our benchmark test in a competitive way\ntrying to beat friends, family members, colleagues or ourselves.\n4\n1.2\nInformatics Background\nSince computer games have a relatively short history and their eﬀects on cog-\nnitive skills have just been started to be researched recently, there are plenty\nof questions to be answered. In [HPR+18], authors reported an increase in ex-\necutive functions in school students after playing computer games. Moisala et\nal. in [MSH+17] shows that enhancements in speed and performance accuracy\nof working memory tasks is related to daily gaming activity.\nIn [BAM+18],\nauthors present an analysis of the impact of action video games on cognitive\nskills.\nUsing computer games to measure cognitive abilities has a short history, but\na promising future. Most research try to measure the presence or severity of a\ncertain cognitive disease such as dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. In [ABR+13],\nauthors show how a long-term use of video games can reduce multitasking costs\nin older adults. Geyer et al. in [GIF+15] show that the change of the score of an\nonline game is in connection with the age-related changes in working memory.\nSeldom can we ﬁnd applications that has been developed for the measure-\nment of cognitive abilities. One such application is reported in [PHC15b] and\n[PHC15a], it is a framework that has been developed to measure cognitive abil-\nities and its change of elders with computer games. This framework is able to\nlog and analyze scores achieved in various online computer games.\nFrom the viewpoint of information theory and HCI (Human-Computer In-\nteraction), the Hick’s law [Seo05] could be an interesting aspect. This law states\nthat the response time of the brain increases with logarithm of the size of the\ninput. For our purposes, it can be an interesting question: how can we apply\nthe Hick’s law (or other information theory ﬁgure) in our benchmark software?\n1.3\nLosing The Character\nWe have experienced the feeling of losing the character during playing several\ngames like for example League of Legends3, Clash of Clans4, Clash Royale5,\nHeroes of the Storm6, Dota 27, World of Warcraft8 or Cabal9.\nNow we share our thoughts about the phenomenon of „losing the character”,\nand give some examples to illustrate it from the game called League of Legends.\nBasically, a match starts kind of slowly and quietly: the laners are farming, as\nwell as the junglers in their own territory. Of course smaller ﬁghts can occur\nin the early stages of the game, like a 1v1 in the solo lanes, or a 3v3 in the\nbottom lane as both of the junglers decides to gank, but these situations are\nrelatively easy to see through. As we head into the mid and late game, teams\nstart ﬁghts more often with more people, even with all of them. This is what\nwe call teamﬁghts. These are harder to handle, because a lot of things can\nappear on our screen at the same time: the champions who participate in the\nﬁght, optionally minions or jungle monsters, and the visual eﬀects of the spells,\nsummoner spells, and the active or passive abilities of the items. Besides them,\n3https:\/\/na.leagueoflegends.com\n4http:\/\/supercell.com\/en\/games\/clashofclans\/\n5http:\/\/supercell.com\/en\/games\/clashroyale\/\n6https:\/\/heroesofthestorm.com\n7https:\/\/www.dota2.com\n8https:\/\/worldofwarcraft.com\n9http:\/\/cabal.playthisgame.com\n5\nwe see a lot of things, we still have to make sure that we fulﬁll our ingame\nrole properly: position well, attack the proper target, or defend our teammates.\nWe have to handle a lot of information at a blink of an eye, so it is completely\nnatural, that sometimes we do not know where to look at or what to do. We can\nlose our own character, which can end with our death; we can lose the target\ncharacter, and it can survive; or we can lose the character that we wanted to\nprotect, thus an important member of the team can die. This can be a short\nexplanation of the phenomenon, which we can also call „losing the focus”.\nAn example ingame footage can be viewed at https:\/\/youtu.be\/wdy3KUm1454,\nstarting at 2:12.\nThese situations are one of the hardest parts of the game, and it is not\neasy to handle them well. The easiest way to prepare for them is to play a\nlot of games, and get experience in them. Also it can help a lot, if we think\nahead before a potential teamﬁght, e.g. which character will be our target, who\nshould we be afraid of, what summoner spells the enemy still has, etc. All of\nthese things can help to execute the ﬁghts more properly.\n2\nBrain Benchmarking Series 6\nBrainB is a Qt C++ desktop application that uses the OpenCV library. It is\ndeveloped as an open source project that is available on GitHub [B´17]. Its source\ncan be built easily on GNU\/Linux systems. But the latest (6.0.3) Windows\nbinary release can also be downloaded as a ZIP ﬁle from http:\/\/smartcity.\ninf.unideb.hu\/~norbi\/BrainBSeries6\/.\nIt is important to show the algorithm of BrainB as precise as possible because\nthe randomness plays a key role in its operation due to boxes doing random\nwalks.\nThe code snippet shown in Listing 1 is the heart of our benchmark\nprogram. It is a simpliﬁed version of the original source code that can be found\nin the GitHub repository at https:\/\/github.com\/nbatfai\/esport-talent-\nsearch\/blob\/master\/BrainBWin.cpp#L65. This code is executed at every 100\nmilliseconds that is ten times per second. First, as shown in Line 1, it computes\nthe distance between the mouse pointer and the center of the box of Samu\nEntropy and the result is stored in the variable called dist that holds the square\nof the Euclidean distance. If the distance is larger than 121 pixels (11 is the\nsquare root of 121) and if it reoccurs 12 consecutive times or more in a row (that\nmeans at least a time interval of 1.2 seconds) and it is also true that the player\nwas controlling the character well in the previous time slices (that is in Line 10\nthe state is equal to found) then we say that the user has lost the character\nSamu Entropy and the visual complexity of the display will be saved in Line 12.\nThe sequence of these losing values and the symmetrical ﬁnding values saved in\nLine 28 are shown in Fig 2. The complexity is computed in bits per second (bps)\nunits that is based on the number of changed pixels between two consecutive\nrectangular environments of the character with a given width and height.\nListing 1: The algorithm for administration of losing and ﬁnding the character.\n1 int\ndist = ( this ->mouse_x\n- x ) * ( this ->mouse_x\n- x )\n2\n+ ( this ->mouse_y\n- y ) * ( this ->mouse_y\n- y );\n3\n4 if ( dist > 121 )\n5\n{\n6\n++ nofLost;\n6\n7\nnofFound = 0;\n8\nif ( nofLost\n> 12 )\n9\n{\n10\nif ( state == found &&\nfirstLost )\n11\n{\n12\nfound2lost.push_back(brainBThread ->get_bps ());\n13\n}\n14\nfirstLost = true;\n15\nstate = lost;\n16\nnofLost = 0;\n17\nbrainBThread ->decComp ();\n18\n}\n19\n}\n20 else\n21\n{\n22\n++ nofFound;\n23\nnofLost = 0;\n24\nif ( nofFound\n> 12 )\n25\n{\n26\nif ( state == lost &&\nfirstLost )\n27\n{\n28\nlost2found.push_back(brainBThread ->get_bps ());\n29\n}\n30\nstate = found;\n31\nnofFound = 0;\n32\nbrainBThread ->incComp ();\n33\n}\n34\n}\nThe ﬁnal result printed by the benchmark after it ends in the form “U R\nabout 5.92902 Kilobytes” is the mean of upper bounds for the bps values of the\ndisplay measured when the variable state changes from found to lost (in Listing\n1 from Line 10 to 14) and vice versa, when the variable state changes from lost\nto found (in Listing 1 from Lines 26 to 30).

This\nmodiﬁcation aﬀects the basic operation of the benchmark, so the ﬁrst objective\nwas to verify that whether the feeling of losing the character still appears cor-\nrectly or not. On Windows systems there were no problems. Some experiments\nusing default settings on Windows 10 can be seen in Fig 3, Fig 4 and Fig 5.\nBut on GNU\/Linux systems test subjects reported that the feeling of losing\nthe character is not experienced. These observations will be detailed in a next\nsection.\n2.2\nLogging Data\nThe state of the BrainB benchmark can be saved at any time by pressing the S\nbutton but measured data is automatically saved after the test is ﬁnished.

The\nreason for this is that even the standard test requires a constant focus of 10\nminutes, which can put a lot of pressure on one’s eyes. To ease this strain as\nmuch as we possibly could, we took lots of things into account. Firstly, we tried\nto maximize the contrast between the background and the ﬁgures. This means\nthat we picked some colors that could be easily distinguished and then we ran\nsome manual tests. The result was a signiﬁcant drop in the overall burden of\nthe eyes.\nAfter this, we thought about how we could make the benchmark available\nfor a wider range of people, namely for those who suﬀer from parachromatism\nor even disambiguation. This is rather important as it is said that roughly 8%\nof men and 0.5% of women10 suﬀer from one of these. In order for them to be\nable to comfortably run our benchmark, we tried to pick colors that are easily\ndistinguishable even for these people.\nAnother problem was that we did not target a speciﬁc age group. On the\ncontrary, we were especially curious about the results of adults, adolescents,\nteenagers and children. Therefore, we needed to pick a color scheme that was\nmodern, vivid, yet not too complex and not too abstract. This, too, required a\nlot of experimentation.\n2.4\nKnown Problems with Series 6\nDespite that our benchmark is developed on Linux it is surprising that test\nsubjects who performed it on Linux did not experience the feeling of losing\n10http:\/\/www.color-blindness.com\/2006\/04\/28\/colorblind-population\n12\nthe character. This problem causes the deteriorated results shown in Fig 6.\nIt is important to note that it has not been detected in earlier series of the\napplication. Moreover, before Series 6, there was no Windows binary edition of\nBrainB program. In Series 6, changing to full screen from windowed causes the\nproblem because Series 6 is sensitive to the diﬀerent mouse sensitivity settings on\nWindows and Linux systems (the measurements shown in Fig 6 were performed\nwith a Logitech mouse with acceleration: 5\/1 and threshold: 5 xset m11 setting).\nA short-term solution may be to standardize the test environment used by each\nmember of a given subset of test subjects. We apply this method to perform\nsystematic measurements with Series 6 in the next section.\nThe long-term\nsolution will be to ﬁne-tune the control of movements of boxes that is hardwired\ninto the Series 6 from Series 5 at this moment. Another possibility is to take\nthe liberty of ﬁne-tuning of the mouse for test subjects who thus would be able\nto choose their custom mouse settings in order to increase their eﬀectiveness.\nThis is also in well accordance with the competitive way of performing our test.\nFig 7 presents two measurements using custom mouse settings.\n2.5\nSystematic Measurements with Series 6\nThe BrainB Series 6 was measured in two groups:\nUDPROG and DEAC-\nHackers. The ﬁrst one is a Facebook community of over 550 actual or former\nstudents of the BSc course of “High Level Programming Languages” at the Uni-\nversity of Debrecen. The second one is an esport department of the University\nof Debrecen’s Athletic Club. Participation in the BrainB Series 6 survey was\nvoluntary in both groups.\nIn the UDPROG community 33 members send back their results including\nthe PNG screenshot and the produced text ﬁle within 2 days from the date of\nannouncement (20 August 2018). The arithmetic mean of the ﬁnal results of\nUDPROG participants is 4.95345. The mean of the number of boxes at the\nmoment when the benchmark ends is 57.1818. The averaged losing and ﬁnding\ncurve for all members is shown in Fig 8a. At the end of the curve the arithmetic\nmean values of complexity of the losing and ﬁnding events are irrelevant because\nthe size of the sequences of losing and ﬁnding events are diﬀerent for every\nparticipants. Fig 8b indicates these diﬀerent sizes.\nIn the DEAC-Hackers community 12 esport athletes have sent back their\nresults that can be seen in Fig 9. It is important to notice that despite low\nsample sizes of test subjects the averaged losing and ﬁnding curves shown in\nFig 8a and 9a have already separated the losing and ﬁnding events.\n3\nConclusion\nOur research hypothesis was that the mean of the complexity of changing lost\nto found is less than the mean of the changing found to lost. Fig 8a and 9a show\nthe fulﬁllment of this hypothesis. It seems very well in these ﬁgures that the\naveraged losing and ﬁnding curve has precisely separated the losing and ﬁnding\nevents.\nIntuitively, this result shows that we lose the character on a higher\ncomplexity level then we ﬁnd it on a relatively lower level again. This simple\nhypothesis has been proved by the results of this study.\n11https:\/\/www.x.org\/archive\/X11R7.7\/doc\/man\/man1\/xset.1.xhtml\n13\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n0\n10000\n20000\n30000\n40000\n50000\n60000\nIndex\nbps\n(a) The test subject was the same as\nin the experiment shown in Fig 3.

Pre-LLM benchmarks such as GLUE\nand SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019b,a) have been\nreplaced by even larger evaluation suites such\nas MMLU (Measuring Massive Multitask Lan-\nguage Understanding; Hendrycks et al., 2021),\nGSM8K (Graduate School Math; Cobbe et al.,\n2021), or BBH (BIG-Bench Hard; Suzgun et al.,\n*Corresponding author.\nEmail: filippo.momente@studenti.unitn.it\n2023; Srivastava et al., 2023). Models with high\nperformance on these benchmarks are taken to pos-\nsess extensive world knowledge along with com-\nplex problem-solving abilities.\nThis trend has promoted standardisation in LLM\nevaluation protocols, with online leaderboards\nconstantly updated as new models are released.\nDespite this undeniable benefit, large QA bench-\nmarks like those mentioned above are not without\nproblems. Evaluation results may be inflated by\ndata contamination (see, e.g., Gema et al. 2025\nfor MMLU and Mirzadeh et al. 2025 for GSMK8)\nand distorted by model sensitivity to prompt\nformat (Zhuo et al., 2024). Moreover, by design,\nsuch benchmarks overlook actual language use in\nfavour of knowledge-intensive tasks where success\nis measured against gold-standard reference\nanswers provided in a single conversational turn.\nThis contrasts with the view, put forward by\nphilosophers and psycholinguists alike (Wittgen-\nstein, 1953; Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969; Clark,\n1996), that the quintessence of language resides\nin situated language use, i.e., using language\nfor a purpose in social and task-based multi-turn\ninteractions (Bisk et al., 2020).\nThe situated and interactive view underpins a\nparallel evaluation trend where LLMs are evaluated\nas goal-directed language users by means of\ninteractive games (Schlangen, 2023; Suglia et al.,\n2024).1 This interactive evaluation paradigm goes\nbeyond single-turn text generation, which is critical\nfor deploying LLMs as agents. Additionally, it\nis less susceptible to data contamination because\nthe vast space of possible multi-turn interactions\nis unlikely to be fully represented in the training\ndata. As a result, interactive games provide a more\nrobust framework for evaluating the true gener-\nalisation capacity of LLMs (Hupkes et al., 2023).\n1Online leaderboards have started to appear for the in-\nteractive games evaluation paradigm; see, e.g., https:\/\/\ntextarena.ai\/, https:\/\/clembench.github.io.\n1\narXiv:2502.14359v1  [cs.CL]  20 Feb 2025\nYet, despite these advantages, it is not easy to\npinpoint which specific abilities underpin models’\nperformance on interactive language games—a\ndifficulty that to some extent also applies to static\nquestion-answering benchmarks such as MMLU.\nIn this paper, we examine these two evaluation\nparadigms—large QA benchmarks and interactive\ngames—and argue that they can provide comple-\nmentary perspectives. First, we investigate whether\nQA benchmarks or games are more effective in\ngauging qualitative differences between models,\ne.g., across model families and sizes. We evaluate\na selection of current LLMs from four model fam-\nilies and find that games highlight differences be-\ntween LLMs more strongly than QA benchmarks:\nWhile scaling model size leads to systematic im-\nprovements on benchmarks, it doesn’t guarantee\nperformance boosts in interactive language use. To\nshed light on the abilities underlying models’ per-\nformance on these two evaluation frameworks, we\nresort to targeted cognitive tests. We propose\na taxonomy of cognitive skills motivated by neu-\nrocognitive science and compile a list of existing\nevaluation datasets designed to assess each skill\nin isolation. We then investigate to what extent\nincreased performance on specific cognitive abili-\nties correlates with performance gain in large QA\nbenchmarks vs. interactive games. Our analysis\nshows that while causal and logical reasoning cor-\nrelate with both static and interactive tests, differ-\nences emerge regarding core executive functions\nand social\/emotional skills; in particular, working\nmemory and emotional intelligence are only signif-\nicantly correlated with performance in games.\n2\nModels\nWe apply our evaluation framework to a selection\nof open-weight LLMs ranging from 7B to 72B\nmodels. Considering that instruction following ca-\npabilities are essential for our analysis, we selected\nmodels that have an average performance on the\nIFEval benchmark (Zhou et al., 2023) higher than\n70% (see Figure 1 for details). We evaluate the fol-\nlowing models: Olmo-2-1124 with 7 and 13 billion\nparameters (OLMo-2-1124-*-Instruct) (Walsh\net al., 2024);\nQwen2.5 with 7B, 32B, and\n72B parameters (Qwen2.5-*-Instruct) (Yang\net al., 2024; Team, 2024);\nLLama-3 with\n8B (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct) and 70B parame-\nters (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct) (Grattafiori et al.,\n2024), and Falcon3-10B-Instruct (Falcon Team,\n2024). See Appendix A for further model details.\n3\nStatic vs. Interactive Assessments\n3.1\nBenchmarks\nLarge\nQA\nbenchmarks\nWe\ntake\nMMLU\n(Hendrycks et al., 2021) and BBH (Suzgun et al.,\n2023) as representative of large QA benchmarks.\nMMLU evaluates whether LLMs can apply knowl-\nedge from specific domains: it consists of multiple-\nchoice questions spanning 57 academic subjects.\nBBH assembles diverse tasks drawing problems\nfrom linguistics, child development, maths, and\ncommon-sense reasoning, among others.\nInteractive games\nWe take clembench (Chala-\nmalasetti et al., 2023) as a characteristic bench-\nmark to assess LLMs’ gameplay ability in dialogue\ngames. We consider the games 1) Taboo, 2) stan-\ndard Wordle and the two variants Wordle (Clue)\nand Wordle (Critic), 3) Reference Game, 4) Image\nGame, and 5) Private\/Shared. See Appendix B.\nFigure 1: Accuracy across the different model sizes:\nIFEval, Static, and Interactive assessments.\n3.2\nHow to Identify Blind Spots in LLMs\nLLM evaluation instruments have most practical\nuse when they allow us to track progress by iden-\ntifying blind spots in models. Here we compare\nthe two evaluation paradigms under study on the\nextent to which they highlight differences between\ncurrent models, helping us form hypotheses about\npossible problem sources and successful mitigation\nstrategies. Figure 1 shows models’ performance\non IFEval, the large QA benchmarks, and interac-\ntive games. As mentioned in Section 2, all models\nare reasonably able to follow instructions as mea-\nsured by IFEval. While the OLMo-2 models are\nmore inconsistent across different model sizes, all\nthe other models exhibit the expected pattern of\nshowcasing better performance on both large QA\n2\nFigure 2: Comparing datasets in their power to discriminate between models of different size but same family (left)\nand of different families but similarly large (right). The number next to the benchmark’s name indicates the ratio of\nperformance between the two models. The asterisk ’*’ next to Wordle indicates that the ratio is undefined.\nbenchmarks and interactive games when parameter\ncount increases. At the same time, we observe that\nmost of the interactive games highlight the bene-\nfits of large model sizes much more strongly. This\ncan more easily be appreciated in Figure 2 (left)\nfor Llama-3.1-8B vs. Llama-3.3-70B. In this vi-\nsualisation, the further away a benchmark is from\nthe diagonal, the more affected performance is by\nmodel size. While playing Wordle is extremely\nchallenging for any model, scaling up the number\nof parameters appears to be fundamental to succeed\nat Private\/Shared, Image Game, and Reference\nGame—much more so than for MMLU and BBH.\nIs size however all we need? Figure 2 (right)\nshows that QA benchmarks do not substantially\ndistinguish between large models of comparable\nsize (Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct vs. Qwen2.5-72B-\nInstruct): scaling on the number of parameters\nresults in performance boosts across model fami-\nlies. Hence, arguably large QA benchmark test for\nabilities than can be expressed within parametric\nknowledge. Given that such benchmarks currently\nare the standard LLM evaluation paradigm, it is\nnot surprising that scaling is high on the agenda of\nmodel developers.

This result supports the hypothesis\nthat size is not all there is behind the potential of\nLLMs to learn inferential strategies for effective\nlanguage use in interaction.\n4\nCognitive Abilities Assessment\nWe now turn to cognitive tests—a complementary\nevaluation method that focuses on specific cog-\nnitive abilities deemed essential for effective lan-\nguage use in real-world situations. We explore\nthe use of targeted cognitive tests to complement\nevaluation based on large QA benchmarks and in-\nteractive games.\n4.1\nTaxonomy and Datasets\nWe present a taxonomy of cognitive abilities in-\nvolved in human functional linguistic competence\n(Mahowald et al., 2024). It is guided by neurocog-\nnitive research (Ward, 2019), and it separates capa-\nbilities into two distinct macro-categories known\nto recruit different brain networks: executive func-\ntions and socio-emotional skills. Executive func-\ntions are broadly defined as the complex processes\nby which we control and optimise our thoughts and\nbehaviour (Baddeley, 1986) and are divided into\ncore and higher-order abilities. Socio-emotional\nskills represent the abilities necessary to interact\nadaptively with other individuals (Higgins, 1987),\nincluding the ability to recognize their emotional\nand cognitive states.\nFor each cognitive ability, we select an existing\nevaluation dataset designed to test it in isolation\ndrawing inspiration from human cognitive assess-\nments. We discard datasets that require manual\nevaluation from the analysis. Table 1 and Table 2\nlist the abilities in the taxonomy and the datasets\nwe use to evaluate them.2 Socio-emotional skills\n2We found no dataset to evaluate inhibitory control.

We advocate the development\nof new interactive benchmarks and targeted\ncognitive tasks inspired by assessing human\nabilities but designed specifically for LLMs.\n1\nIntroduction\nEvaluating LLMs is critical to track progress,\nidentify blind spots, and ultimately advance to-\nwards the kind of language-based AI systems\nwe want as a society (Wooldridge and Jennings,\n1995).\nCurrently, the most widespread way to\nevaluate LLMs is by means of large benchmarks\nmade up of miscellaneous question-answering\n(QA) tasks. Pre-LLM benchmarks such as GLUE\nand SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019b,a) have been\nreplaced by even larger evaluation suites such\nas MMLU (Measuring Massive Multitask Lan-\nguage Understanding; Hendrycks et al., 2021),\nGSM8K (Graduate School Math; Cobbe et al.,\n2021), or BBH (BIG-Bench Hard; Suzgun et al.,\n*Corresponding author.\nEmail: filippo.momente@studenti.unitn.it\n2023; Srivastava et al., 2023). Models with high\nperformance on these benchmarks are taken to pos-\nsess extensive world knowledge along with com-\nplex problem-solving abilities.\nThis trend has promoted standardisation in LLM\nevaluation protocols, with online leaderboards\nconstantly updated as new models are released.\nDespite this undeniable benefit, large QA bench-\nmarks like those mentioned above are not without\nproblems. Evaluation results may be inflated by\ndata contamination (see, e.g., Gema et al. 2025\nfor MMLU and Mirzadeh et al. 2025 for GSMK8)\nand distorted by model sensitivity to prompt\nformat (Zhuo et al., 2024). Moreover, by design,\nsuch benchmarks overlook actual language use in\nfavour of knowledge-intensive tasks where success\nis measured against gold-standard reference\nanswers provided in a single conversational turn.\nThis contrasts with the view, put forward by\nphilosophers and psycholinguists alike (Wittgen-\nstein, 1953; Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969; Clark,\n1996), that the quintessence of language resides\nin situated language use, i.e., using language\nfor a purpose in social and task-based multi-turn\ninteractions (Bisk et al., 2020).\nThe situated and interactive view underpins a\nparallel evaluation trend where LLMs are evaluated\nas goal-directed language users by means of\ninteractive games (Schlangen, 2023; Suglia et al.,\n2024).1 This interactive evaluation paradigm goes\nbeyond single-turn text generation, which is critical\nfor deploying LLMs as agents. Additionally, it\nis less susceptible to data contamination because\nthe vast space of possible multi-turn interactions\nis unlikely to be fully represented in the training\ndata. As a result, interactive games provide a more\nrobust framework for evaluating the true gener-\nalisation capacity of LLMs (Hupkes et al., 2023).\n1Online leaderboards have started to appear for the in-\nteractive games evaluation paradigm; see, e.g., https:\/\/\ntextarena.ai\/, https:\/\/clembench.github.io.\n1\narXiv:2502.14359v1  [cs.CL]  20 Feb 2025\nYet, despite these advantages, it is not easy to\npinpoint which specific abilities underpin models’\nperformance on interactive language games—a\ndifficulty that to some extent also applies to static\nquestion-answering benchmarks such as MMLU.\nIn this paper, we examine these two evaluation\nparadigms—large QA benchmarks and interactive\ngames—and argue that they can provide comple-\nmentary perspectives. First, we investigate whether\nQA benchmarks or games are more effective in\ngauging qualitative differences between models,\ne.g., across model families and sizes. We evaluate\na selection of current LLMs from four model fam-\nilies and find that games highlight differences be-\ntween LLMs more strongly than QA benchmarks:\nWhile scaling model size leads to systematic im-\nprovements on benchmarks, it doesn’t guarantee\nperformance boosts in interactive language use. To\nshed light on the abilities underlying models’ per-\nformance on these two evaluation frameworks, we\nresort to targeted cognitive tests. We propose\na taxonomy of cognitive skills motivated by neu-\nrocognitive science and compile a list of existing\nevaluation datasets designed to assess each skill\nin isolation. We then investigate to what extent\nincreased performance on specific cognitive abili-\nties correlates with performance gain in large QA\nbenchmarks vs. interactive games. Our analysis\nshows that while causal and logical reasoning cor-\nrelate with both static and interactive tests, differ-\nences emerge regarding core executive functions\nand social\/emotional skills; in particular, working\nmemory and emotional intelligence are only signif-\nicantly correlated with performance in games.\n2\nModels\nWe apply our evaluation framework to a selection\nof open-weight LLMs ranging from 7B to 72B\nmodels. Considering that instruction following ca-\npabilities are essential for our analysis, we selected\nmodels that have an average performance on the\nIFEval benchmark (Zhou et al., 2023) higher than\n70% (see Figure 1 for details). We evaluate the fol-\nlowing models: Olmo-2-1124 with 7 and 13 billion\nparameters (OLMo-2-1124-*-Instruct) (Walsh\net al., 2024);\nQwen2.5 with 7B, 32B, and\n72B parameters (Qwen2.5-*-Instruct) (Yang\net al., 2024; Team, 2024);\nLLama-3 with\n8B (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct) and 70B parame-\nters (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct) (Grattafiori et al.,\n2024), and Falcon3-10B-Instruct (Falcon Team,\n2024). See Appendix A for further model details.\n3\nStatic vs. Interactive Assessments\n3.1\nBenchmarks\nLarge\nQA\nbenchmarks\nWe\ntake\nMMLU\n(Hendrycks et al., 2021) and BBH (Suzgun et al.,\n2023) as representative of large QA benchmarks.\nMMLU evaluates whether LLMs can apply knowl-\nedge from specific domains: it consists of multiple-\nchoice questions spanning 57 academic subjects.\nBBH assembles diverse tasks drawing problems\nfrom linguistics, child development, maths, and\ncommon-sense reasoning, among others.\nInteractive games\nWe take clembench (Chala-\nmalasetti et al., 2023) as a characteristic bench-\nmark to assess LLMs’ gameplay ability in dialogue\ngames. We consider the games 1) Taboo, 2) stan-\ndard Wordle and the two variants Wordle (Clue)\nand Wordle (Critic), 3) Reference Game, 4) Image\nGame, and 5) Private\/Shared. See Appendix B.\nFigure 1: Accuracy across the different model sizes:\nIFEval, Static, and Interactive assessments.\n3.2\nHow to Identify Blind Spots in LLMs\nLLM evaluation instruments have most practical\nuse when they allow us to track progress by iden-\ntifying blind spots in models. Here we compare\nthe two evaluation paradigms under study on the\nextent to which they highlight differences between\ncurrent models, helping us form hypotheses about\npossible problem sources and successful mitigation\nstrategies. Figure 1 shows models’ performance\non IFEval, the large QA benchmarks, and interac-\ntive games. As mentioned in Section 2, all models\nare reasonably able to follow instructions as mea-\nsured by IFEval. While the OLMo-2 models are\nmore inconsistent across different model sizes, all\nthe other models exhibit the expected pattern of\nshowcasing better performance on both large QA\n2\nFigure 2: Comparing datasets in their power to discriminate between models of different size but same family (left)\nand of different families but similarly large (right). The number next to the benchmark’s name indicates the ratio of\nperformance between the two models. The asterisk ’*’ next to Wordle indicates that the ratio is undefined.\nbenchmarks and interactive games when parameter\ncount increases. At the same time, we observe that\nmost of the interactive games highlight the bene-\nfits of large model sizes much more strongly. This\ncan more easily be appreciated in Figure 2 (left)\nfor Llama-3.1-8B vs. Llama-3.3-70B. In this vi-\nsualisation, the further away a benchmark is from\nthe diagonal, the more affected performance is by\nmodel size. While playing Wordle is extremely\nchallenging for any model, scaling up the number\nof parameters appears to be fundamental to succeed\nat Private\/Shared, Image Game, and Reference\nGame—much more so than for MMLU and BBH.\nIs size however all we need? Figure 2 (right)\nshows that QA benchmarks do not substantially\ndistinguish between large models of comparable\nsize (Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct vs. Qwen2.5-72B-\nInstruct): scaling on the number of parameters\nresults in performance boosts across model fami-\nlies. Hence, arguably large QA benchmark test for\nabilities than can be expressed within parametric\nknowledge. Given that such benchmarks currently\nare the standard LLM evaluation paradigm, it is\nnot surprising that scaling is high on the agenda of\nmodel developers. In contrast, interactive games\nseem to provide a different picture: models with\ncomparable parametric capacity perform very dif-\nferently on Image Game, Private\/Shared, and Wor-\ndle (Clue\/Critic). A similar trend can be observed\namong the other models we evaluated (see details\nin Appendix I). This result supports the hypothesis\nthat size is not all there is behind the potential of\nLLMs to learn inferential strategies for effective\nlanguage use in interaction.\n4\nCognitive Abilities Assessment\nWe now turn to cognitive tests—a complementary\nevaluation method that focuses on specific cog-\nnitive abilities deemed essential for effective lan-\nguage use in real-world situations.

In this scenario, a Nash equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time based on\nthe size of the extensive-form game (Shoham & Leyton-Brown, 2008). Recent significant achieve-\nments, such as achieving superhuman performance in the heads-up no-limit Texas hold’em poker\ngame (Moravˇc´ık et al., 2017; Brown & Sandholm, 2018), demonstrate that researchers have a good\nunderstanding of the problem of computing a Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum extensive-\nform games, both in theory and in practice. However, the problem of computing a Nash equilibrium\nin multiplayer games is not as well understood, as it is generally a challenging task (Chen & Deng,\n2005; Zhang et al., 2023b). Therefore, more and more AI researchers focus on solving multiplayer\ngames (Brown & Sandholm, 2019; FAIR et al., 2022; Carminati et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023a;\nMcAleer et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024)\nTo facilitate the development of designing efficient learning algorithms for solving multiplayer\ngames, we propose a multiplayer game platform for solving Urban Network Security Games\n(UNSGs) that model the following real-world situations. In urban areas, ensuring public safety\nand security is crucial for law enforcement agencies. One significant challenge they face is the high\nnumber of innocent bystanders who are injured or killed during police pursuits (Rivara & Mack,\n2004). It’s essential to develop effective strategies that allow multiple officers to apprehend fleeing\ncriminals while minimizing risks to civilians and property damage. This paper focuses on respond-\ning to major incidents such as terrorist attacks or bank robberies, where police officers need to\nswiftly intercept the attackers during their escape. This requires efficient strategies for apprehending\nfleeing criminals, which can be analyzed and developed using structured approaches like UNSGs.\nHowever, solving UNSGs is NP-hard (Jain et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2017; 2019). More specifi-\ncally, the strategy space of players in UNSGs cannot be enumerated due to the memory constraint of\ncomputers (Jain et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2019). Moreover, if players do not have real-time informa-\ntion, they have to make decisions with imperfect information. In addition, if police officers cannot\ncommunicate during the game play, they have to make decisions independently. Finally, UNSGs\nincorporate cooperation between police officers and competition between the criminal and team of\npolice officers. To address the above challenges, previous efforts have been made to tackle UNSGs.\nThat is, they extended the Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) (Zinkevich et al., 2008) to\nCFR-MIX algorithm (Li et al., 2021), incorporating deep learning enhancements from Deep CFR\n(Brown et al., 2019). Additionally, they utilized the Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP) approach\n(Heinrich & Silver, 2016), further developed into NSG-NFSP (Xue et al., 2021) and NSGZero (Xue\net al., 2022), which are tailored to solving UNSGs under the NFSP framework. Moreover, they ex-\ntended the learning framework, Policy-Space Response Oracles (PSRO) (Lanctot et al., 2017), to an\nadvanced variant Pretrained PSRO (Li et al., 2023a) to speed up. Finally, they developed Grasper (Li\net al., 2024) based on Pretrained PSRO, an innovative algorithm that can generalize across different\ngame settings. All of them are based on the state-of-the-art game-theoretical algorithm frameworks.\n2\nHowever, these efforts are still hampered by performance and scalability issues, as shown in our\nexperiments.\nTo foster the development of scalable algorithms capable of addressing city-scale UNSGs, we pro-\npose the creation of an open-source platform, GraphChase, specifically tailored for UNSG. The\narchitecture of GraphChase is depicted in Figure 1, designed to provide researchers with a com-\nprehensive UNSG platform and facilitate the development and evaluation of scalable strategy for\npursuers. Specifically, we made the following contributions: i) Development of a unified and flex-\nible UNSG environment: We developed a versatile platform designed to support various configu-\nrations of UNSGs. Specifically, this environment allows for modifying game parameters, enabling\nresearchers to simulate different real-world UNSG scenarios under various conditions. The inherent\nflexibility of GraphChase supports a wide range of experimental setups, from small-scale laboratory\nexperiments to city-wide simulations. All these make GraphChase a suitable tool for theoretical re-\nsearch and practical application testing. ii) Implementation of learning algorithms: GraphChase\nis designed to facilitate the execution of a wide range of algorithms. Based on the standardized\nplatform, we successfully implement several advanced deep learning-based algorithms, enabling\nthe consistent comparison of different strategic approaches. By efficiently integrating algorithms\nwithin the platform, it reduces the time overhead of the simulation resulting in faster convergence\nfrom the perspective of wall-clock time. And iii) Benchmark results: We conduct experiments on\nUNSGs with synthetic and real-world graphs to evaluate the performance of the different algorithms\nimplemented on the GraphChase platform. The results from these experiments are recorded and\ncompiled into comprehensive benchmarks. Our results show that, although previous algorithms can\nachieve reasonable performance, they still suffer performance and scalability issues in real-world\nsettings. These results suggest that substantial efforts are still required to develop effective and ef-\nficient algorithms for solving real-world UNSGs. We believe that GraphChase not only facilitates\nthe development of efficient algorithms for solving real-world problems but also paves the way for\nsignificant advancements in algorithmic development for solving general multiplayer games.\n2\nURBAN NETWORK SECURITY GAMES\nMotivated by the security games on urban roads (Jain et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2017; 2019), we\nproposed our GraphChase platform for solving UNSGs that model the interactions between multiple\npursuers (police officers) and an evader (criminal). The variants of UNSGs can model different real-\nworld settings, e.g., whether real-time information is available, whether pursuers can communicate.\nNow, we introduce the definition of these games.\n2.1\nGAME DEFINITION\nTake, for instance, the scenario where pursuers are tasked with capturing an evader escaping on\nurban roads. We introduce the concept of UNSGs. First, urban roads and pathways naturally lend\nthemselves to being modeled as graphs, where intersections and streets form nodes and edges, re-\nspectively. The graph can be represented by G = (V, E), where V is a set of vertices, and E is a\nset of edges. In UNSGs, graphs can be directed or undirected, corresponding to one-way streets and\ntwo-way streets, and weighted or unweighted, where the weight can be used to reflect different travel\ncosts or terrains. This graphical representation allows for a structured and systematic approach to\nsimulating the complex dynamics of urban pursuits. Specifically, in graph G, we use a subset of the\nvertex set, Eexit ⊂E, to represent the set of exit nodes from which the criminal can escape. For\neach vertex v ∈V , we use N(v) to represent the set of neighbours of v.\nIn UNSGs, the pursuer and the evader are represented as agents moving across a network.\nIt\nis important to note that the evader and the pursuer can be a single agent or consist of multi-\nple agents. For example, several pursuers would collaborate to chase a single evader or chase a\nteam of evaders. Formally, the set of players N = (p, e), where p = (p1, p2, ..., pn), n ≥1\nrepresents pursuers and e = (e1, e2, ..., en), n ≥1 represents the evader. Since the pursuers can\nblock all exit nodes for a certain period, we can predefine the length of the lockdown. Formally,\nlet T represent the number of steps in which the game terminates and lp\n0 = (lp1\n0 , lp2\n0 , ..., lpn\n0 ),\nle\n0 = (le1\n0 , le2\n0 , ..., len\n0 ) represent the initial locations of the evader and the pursuer, respectively.\nAt each step, each player in the game would move from vertex v to one of its neighborhood\nvertices w ∈N(v). Specifically, at game step t < T, the locations of the evader and the pur-\nsuer, respectively, are lp\nt = (lp1\nt , lp2\nt , ..., lpn\nt ), le\nt = (le1\nt , le2\nt , ..., len\nt ). Then the available action\n3\nset of the pursuer is a Cartesian product of the sets of neighboring vertices of each evader, i.e.,\nAp(h) = {(lp1, lp2, ..., lpn)|li ∈N(li\nt), ∀i ∈{p1, p2, ..., pn}}. Similarly, the available action set of\nthe evader is Ae(h) = {(le1, le2, ..., len)|li ∈N(li\nt), ∀i ∈{e1, e2, ..., en}}. All players act simulta-\nneously at game step t, i.e., the pursuer and the evader select actions from their action sets. Then all\nplayers move from lp\nt and le\nt to lp\nt+1 and le\nt+1, respectively. We can also convert the simultaneous-\nmove game into a turn-based game by ignoring the selected action of the first-act player when the\nsecond player acts. This process repeats until a termination condition is met. The evader is con-\nsidered caught if the evader and any of the pursuers occupy the same point at any time within the\nmaximum time horizon. The termination conditions of the game include: (i) the pursuer catches\nthe evader (i.e., all criminals); (ii) the evader (i.e., all criminals) escapes from exit nodes; and (iii)\nthe game reaches the predefined game step T, i.e., t = T. In cases (i) and (iii) the pursuer wins.\nOtherwise, if the evader successfully escapes to the outside world, the evader wins. Based on these\nresults, each player gets their corresponding rewards.\n2.2\nINFORMATION AND STRATEGY\nIn different real-world cases, the pursuer and evader may access various information, i.e., the loca-\ntion information of each player. With the aid of tracking devices, such as the StarChase GPS-based\nsystem (Gaither et al., 2017), police officers can get the real-time location of the criminal. In another\ncase, the police officers may not know the ability of the criminal. To avoid the worst case, the police\nofficers usually assume that the criminal can get the real-time location of the police officers. There-\nfore, there are four cases: i) the evader can get the real-time location information of the pursuer\nwhile the pursuer cannot get the real-time location information of the evader; ii) the pursuer can get\nthe real-time location information of the evader while the evader cannot get the real-time location\ninformation of the pursuer; iii) both the evader and the pursuer can get the real-time location infor-\nmation of the opponent; and iv) both the evader and the pursuer cannot get the real-time location\ninformation.\nMoreover, if pursuers cannot communicate during the game play, they have to make decisions in-\ndependently. However, if pursuers can communicate during the game play, they can correlate their\nactions. Using this case as an example, based on the available real-time location information, the\nbehavior strategy σe or σp is a function that maps every decision point to a probability distribution\nover the available action set. Then, a strategy profile σ is a tuple of one strategy for each player, i.e.,\nσ = (σp, σe). The pursuer’s payoff function is up(σp, σe) ∈R with up(σp, σe) = −ue(σp, σe) for\nthe evader. We adopt the Nash equilibrium (NE) (Nash, 1950) as the solution concept for this case\nsince the NE strategy profile is a steady state in which no player can increase its utility by unilater-\nally deviating. In our GraphChase platform, we consider the NE strategy of the pursuer would be\nthe optimal strategy and take the worst-case utility of the pursuer as the measure for the pursuer’s\nstrategy, i.e., maxσp∈Σp minσe∈Σe up(σp, σe).\n2.3\nCHALLENGES\nIn UNSGs, pursuers are tasked with capturing an evader escaping on urban roads. The network-\nbased environment could lead to the strategy space of players in UNSGs cannot be enumerated due\nto the memory constraint of computers (Jain et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2019). That is, if a player’s\nstrategy is a path, then we cannot enumerate all paths due to memory constraints in large-scale\nUNSGs. In fact, even with the relatively simple setting where the time dynamics are ignored, and\nthe pursuers can correlate their actions, the problem of solving UNSGs is still very hard (Jain et al.,\n2011). We could expect that solving UNSGs will be harder in more complicated settings.\nMoreover, some UNSGs operate under conditions of imperfect information when real-time infor-\nmation is not available. In some cases, players possess asymmetric knowledge about the state of the\nenvironment. In some UNSGs, the escaping evader location and potential strategies might not be\nfully known to the pursuers in some scenarios, and conversely, the evader may have limited informa-\ntion about the evader locations. The partial observability also poses unique challenges for addressing\nthe UNSGs. In some cases, the maximum number of time steps may not be predicted accurately.\nTherefore, it necessitates the development of robust algorithms capable of making decisions based\non imperfect data and under uncertainty, requiring sophisticated decision-making processes akin to\nthose used in real-world scenarios.\n4\nEnvironment\nGame Module\nGraph, initial point, time horizon,…\nPursuer\nRunner\nEvader\nRunner\nAgent Module\n…\nPursuer\nPolicy\nEvader\nPolicy\n…\nPSRO\nBased\nMethod\nSolver.solve()\nPSRO.solve()\nAlgorithms\nCFR-MIX\nNSG-NFSP\nNSGZero\nPretrained \nPSRO\nGrasper\n……\nfor iter in range(iterations):\n         add_new_evader()\nadd_new_pursuer()\nupdate_meta_game()\ncompute_meta_strategy()\n……\n…….\nfor episode in range(episodes):\n          obs, info = env.reset()\nwhile not done:\n                    evader.get_action()\n                    pursuer.get_action()\n                    env.step()\n          pursuer.train()\n          evader.train()\n……\nSolver Module\nYes\nNo\nUpdate\nNew Policy\nFigure 2: The core structure and workflow of GraphChase.\nFurthermore, pursuers cannot communicate during the game play in some UNSGs, and then they\nhave to make decisions independently. This case is similar to general multiplayer games, where NE\nis commonly used as a solution concept. However, computing an NE is hard generally (Chen &\nDeng, 2005; Zhang et al., 2023b).\nIn addition, the UNSG, inherently a zero-sum game, involves direct competition between the pur-\nsuers and the escaping evader, where one’s gain is precisely the other’s loss, reflecting the purely\nadversarial nature of their interactions. Concurrently, profound cooperation within the team of pur-\nsuers is also essential. pursuers must work together seamlessly to effectively capture the escaping\nevader. The pursuers share the same utility function, aiming collectively to minimize the escape pos-\nsibilities of the evader. This blend of competitive and cooperative elements introduces significant\ncomplexities in solving UNSGs. The dual nature of interactions demands algorithms that can han-\ndle both aspects simultaneously—optimizing competitive moves against the escaping evader while\ncoordinating strategies among multiple pursuers.\nThese elements—combined competitive and cooperative dynamics, along with the challenge of op-\nerating under imperfect information or independent moves — make the UNSG an exemplary bench-\nmark for assessing the effectiveness of algorithms in complex and unpredictable environments. By\nproviding a platform that mimics the diverse scales and complexities of UNSGs, GraphChase offers\na valuable tool for advancing the development of scalable algorithms.\n3\nPLATFORM: GRAPHCHASE\nAs shown in Figure 1, GraphChase provides template scripts for quick-start, and, once completed by\nthe user, it carries out training and testing procedures for comparison. Results, such as the worst-case\nreward, are generated and available for review.\n3.1\nCORE COMPONENTS\nOur GraphChase platform features a flexible game environment specifically designed to facilitate\ncomprehensive simulations of UNSGs. The parameters that users can control to generate the graph\nstructure are detailed in Appendix C. There is a brief introduction about how to use GraphChase in\nAppendix F. At the core of this environment is a versatile system architecture, as depicted in Figure\n2, which clearly outlines the primary components and their interactions within the platform. The\nmodular architecture comprising the Game Environment, Agent, and Solver components enhances\nplatform versatility, facilitating both adaptation to diverse research requirements and integration\nof various algorithmic approaches. This modular design architecture enables researchers to easily\ncustomization and scale their own problems.\n5\nGame Module. To enhance the flexibility of our platform, GraphChase is designed to support\nextensive customization of game parameters, enabling users to simulate different UNSG scenar-\nios tailored to their specific demands. This customization capability includes several key features.\nFirst, users have the option to design or import their graphs for simulation. This could range from\nsimple, manually-generated grid diagrams to more complex real-world urban layouts, such as the\nSingapore road map. Any graph format can be transformed into an adjacency list as the input to\nthe game generation function. This feature allows researchers to explore UNSG in simulations that\nare directly relevant to their specific areas of study or practical application needs. Second, users\ncan specify key strategic points within the graph, such as initial positions of the pursuer and the\nevader, and exit nodes. This level of customization not only adds complexity and variability to the\nsimulations but also allows for testing strategies under different initial conditions and escape routes,\nmaking each game unique even when played on the same graph. Third, the platform supports cus-\ntomization of the time horizon for each game, accommodating both quick resolutions and longer\nstrategic engagements. Fourth, since GraphChase is based on the Gymnasium library, the amount\nand type of information accessible to each player can be easily adjusted by users via the API of gym-\nnasium.Env.step(). This feature allows the evader and the pursuer to have limited visibility of each\nother’s locations and moves, creating more realistic scenarios that closely replicate the information\nasymmetry often found in real-world situations. In conclusion, by allowing users to freely define the\nstructure of the graph, GraphChase enables a broad spectrum of simulation possibilities. The flexi-\nbility of GraphChase allows users to meticulously design games that meet their specific research or\noperational requirements. Furthermore, through integration with the Gymnasium library, users can\nsignificantly reduce the time to learn and utilize GraphChase, while also leveraging various Gym-\nnasium wrappers to conveniently run environments in parallel and visualize the performance of the\ntrained models.\nAgent Module. The Agent Module consists of two parts: the agent policy and the agent runner.\nThe policy refers to the algorithms adopted by the agent, such as PPO, MAPPO, and NSGZero.\nThe agent runner is responsible for simulation in the environment against opponents and uses the\nobtained data to update the agent policy. Specifically, an agent runner must have a get action(data)\nmethod, where data is a tuple providing the input required for the agent policy to generate actions.\nThe actions made by the policy are returned as the output of the get action() method. Additionally, if\nthe agent needs to improve its policy (not necessary in some cases, such as random strategies), it must\nhave a train() method. Users can freely define this method according to the requirements of their\ndesigned algorithms. In summary, with this agent module structure, users can customize pursuers\nand evaders adopting various algorithms and can easily integrate with the Game module introduced\nearlier and the solver module discussed later in the paper. This flexible structure provides a rich\ntesting ground for developing both defensive and offensive strategies within the game environment,\nallowing users to test the performance of different algorithms efficiently.\nSolver Module. The Solver module of our GraphChase platform encompasses a variety of al-\ngorithms designed to address UNSGs, aiming to facilitate users in comparing the performance of\nvarious algorithms. Given that the current state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Pretrained PSRO\nand Grasper, are based on the PSRO framework, we have integrated the PSRO learning framework\nwithin our platform to solve UNSGs. Users merely need to define the training methods for both\nthe pursuer runner and the evader runner and provide the environment with parameters to initialize\nthe PSRO algorithm. By designing the code structure in this manner, users can freely modify the\nalgorithms used by the pursuer, such as PPO or MAPPO, and seamlessly integrate them within the\nPSRO framework, thereby maximizing code reusability. Additionally, if users design a new learning\nframework and want to compare its performance to PSRO, they only need to define the environment\nand agents as introduced before, then a training task can be easily started.\n3.2\nBENCHMARK ALGORITHMS\nBased on our GraphChase platform, we have implemented several deep-learning algorithms that\nsolve UNSGs. Here, we provide a brief overview of these algorithms and outline their operational\nprocess within our platform, as illustrated in Figure 2.\nTo address the inherent challenges of imperfect information in UNSGs, we integrate several sophis-\nticated algorithms into GraphChase. It includes: 1) CFR-MIX algorithm (Li et al., 2021), incorpo-\nrating deep learning enhancements (Brown et al., 2019) based on counterfactual regret minimization\n6\n(CFR) (Zinkevich et al., 2008); 2) NSG-NFSP (Xue et al., 2021) based on the neural fictitious self-\nplay approach (Heinrich & Silver, 2016); 3) NSGZero (Xue et al., 2022) based on neural Monte\nCarlo tree search; 4) Variants of the PSRO framework (Lanctot et al., 2017): Pretrained PSRO (Li\net al., 2023a) and Grasper (Li et al., 2024). Figure 2 illustrates the operational process of these\nalgorithms within our GraphChase platform.\nEach algorithm is implemented to integrate with the game’s underlying mechanics through well-\ndefined interfaces, ensuring they can operate effectively within the platform’s architecture. Firstly,\nby inputting the initial positions of agents and the time horizon of the game, we set up the game\nenvironment. Simultaneously, we initialize the pursuer runner according to the solver algorithms, as\nshown in the yellow frame. Then, depending on whether the chosen algorithm requires the PSRO\nlearning framework, different solving processes are employed. If the PSRO framework is not re-\nquired, the solver.solve() method is executed. In this method, the evader and pursuer runner interact\ncontinuously with the environment to generate data, which is then used to update the policy network,\nproducing new strategies. If the PSRO framework is used, the PSRO.solve() method is executed.\nDuring each iteration, the opponent’s strategy is alternately fixed, and a best response to the oppo-\nnent is generated. The meta game is then updated based on the simulation results, and the current\npolicy oracle’s meta strategy is computed. Subsequently, the runner’s policies are updated, and the\nprocess proceeds to the next training cycle.\nEvaluation. In our platform, the primary objective is to compute the optimal defense strategy for\nthe pursuer, akin to strategizing the most effective tactics for police officers in realistic scenarios.\nUpon determining the pursuer’s strategy through any of the algorithms available on the platform,\nwe adopt the worst-case utility as our principal evaluation metric. As introduced before, to compute\nthe worst-case utility, we first identify the best response strategy of the evader against the pursuer’s\nstrategy being evaluated. Then, we compute the pursuer’s worst-case utility by simulating the game\nusing the pursuer’s strategy and the best response strategy of the evader. This evaluation method\nhelps ensure that the strategy is not only theoretically sound but also practically viable under the\nmost demanding conditions.\n4\nEXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION\nWe conduct experiments to evaluate GraphChase and show the issues of existing algorithms.\n4.1\nEXPERIMENTAL SETTING\nWe conduct the following three sets of experiments for the experimental evaluation. 1) To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of GraphChase, we compare the training procedure of algorithms implemented in\nGraphChase with the training procedure of algorithms implemented by the original authors1. 2) To\nevaluate the performance of existing algorithms, we calculate the reward (the probability of catching\nthe evader) of the pursuer in the worst-case setting. That is, the pursuer’s policy in a trained model\nwill be played against all available paths of the evader, and the worst-case reward will be the reward\nof this model. 3) To evaluate the scalability of existing algorithms, we run these algorithms to solve\nrealistic and large games.\nWe run the first two sets of experiments on the following two games shown in Appendix A. The first\ngame is easier to solve as the evader will be caught with a probability of 1 (ground truth), but the\nsecond game is harder to solve as the evader will only be caught with a probability of 0.5 (ground\ntruth). Both games are run on a 7 × 7 grid network with four exits, four pursuers, and one evader. In\nthe first set of experiments, we set T = 6. In the second set of experiments, we evaluate the pursuers’\ntrained model in the first set of experiments against all paths of the evader with the maximum length\nof each path as 6 and 12, respectively. Finally, we conducted a third set of experiments on a game\nset in a 100 × 100 grid network with a maximum time horizon of T = 200. In this scenario, four\npursuers attempt to capture a single evader who is trying to escape successfully through one of 12\nexit nodes.\n1Codes were shared by the original authors of these algorithms.\n7\n4.2\nBENCHMARK RESULTS\nThe Effectiveness of GraphChase. The results of the evaluation of GraphChase are shown in\nFigures 3 and 4 (Results for other algorithms are in Appendix B). We can see that the algorithms\nbased on our GraphChase perform similarly to the algorithms based on the original codes. In most\ncases, we can see that algorithms based on GraphChase converge faster than the algorithms based\non the original codes, which shows the effectiveness and efficiency of our GraphChase.2\nTo further verify that algorithms based on GraphChase can recover the performance of the algorithms\nbased on the original codes with significantly less time, we first show that our algorithms based on\nGraphChase can recover the performance of the algorithms based on the original codes in a variety\nof scenarios used in the UNSG domain (Xue et al., 2021; 2022; Li et al., 2023a; 2024) in Appendix\nD. These networks, including the 15 × 15 grid network, the real-world Singapore map, and the real-\nworld Manhattan map, are representatives because the 15 × 15 grid network represents the randomly\ngenerated network, and two real-world networks represent different topological structures in real-\nworld cities. Then, in Appendix E, we show that algorithms based on GraphChase run significantly\nfaster than algorithms based on the original codes in terms of simulation and data-saving time, and\nwe explain the reasons behind the faster convergence of GraphChase.\n0\n10000\n20000\n30000\n40000\n50000\n60000\nRun Time (seconds)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nPursuer Reward\nOriginal code\nGraphChase\n(a) NSG-NFSP\n2500\n5000\n7500\n10000\n12500\n15000\n17500\n20000\n22500\nRun Time (seconds)\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nPursuer Reward\nOriginal code\nGraphChase\n(b) Pretrained PSRO\n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\n20000\nRun Time (seconds)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nPursuer Reward\nOriginal code\nGraphChase\n(c) Grasper\nFigure 3: The training procedure on the easy game with a caught probability of 1.\n0\n10000\n20000\n30000\n40000\n50000\n60000\nRun Time (seconds)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nPursuer Reward\nOriginal code\nGraphChase\n(a) NSG-NFSP\n2500\n5000\n7500\n10000\n12500\n15000\n17500\n20000\nRun Time (seconds)\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nPursuer Reward\nOriginal code\nGraphChase\n(b) Pretrained PSRO\n0\n10000\n20000\n30000\n40000\nRun Time (seconds)\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\n0.50\nPursuer Reward\nOriginal code\nGraphChase\n(c) Grasper\nFigure 4: The training procedure on the hard game with a caught probability of 0.5.\nThe Performance Issue of Existing Algorithms. The performance evaluation of existing algo-\nrithms for solving UNSGs is shown in Table 1. We can see that if an algorithm converges during\ntraining, it will perform well for solving the easy game (with a caught probability of 1) but may not\nperform well for solving the hard game (with a caught probability of 0.5). Increasing the maximum\nlength of the evader’s paths also will damage the performance.\nThe main reason is that, when the evader does not have real-time location information of pursuers,\ncomputing the evader’s best response against the strategy of pursuers is a very hard sparse-reward\nproblem, which involves finding an escape path from the initial location to an exit node. To simplify\nthis problem, almost all existing algorithms use the following best response approach of the evader:\nThe evader first chooses an exit node and then randomly takes a simple (acyclic) path that guarantees\nreaching the chosen exit node before exceeding the maximum time horizon. This approach reduces\nthe strategy space of the evader but cannot provide the true best response strategy for the evader.\nIn addition, due to the above-mentioned challenge, almost all existing algorithms assume that the\nmaximum length of the evader paths is short during training. Then, the strategy of pursuers may be\nexploited if the evader takes a longer path.\n2CFR-MIX and NSGZero solved games on 5 × 5 network with T = 4 because they run too slow.\n8\nMaximum length of paths for evaluation\nAlgorithm\nTraining\nT = 6\nT = 6\nT = 12\nT = 12\nPretrained PSRO\n2h\/1.5h\n0.01\n0.93\n0.01\n0.92\nGrasper\n7.7h\/2.5h\n0.12\n0.97\n0.05\n0.95\nNSG-NFSP\n5.5h\/3.3h\n0.03\n0.59\n0.03\n0.57\nNSGZero\n18h\/18h\n0.03\n0.06\n0.03\n0.05\nNSGZero (T = 3)\n11.3h\/7h\n0.01\n0.32\n0.0\n0.19\nNSGZero (5 × 5)\n1.8h\/1h\n0.42\n1\n0.39\n0.94\nCFR-MIX (5 × 5)\n6.9h\/6.3h\n0.03\n0.38\n0.01\n0.16\nGround Truth\nhard(0.5)\/easy(1)\n0.5\n1\n0.5\n1\nTable 1: The performance of existing algorithms in the worst-case setting. For the grid network, the\nmaximum length of the evader’s paths for evaluation is T = 4 or T = 8.\nThe Scalability Issue of Existing Algorithms. From the first set of experiments above, we can\nsee that the existing algorithms require several hours to converge for solving small games, as shown\nin Table 1. For solving this large game with a 100 × 100 grid network, we cannot see reasonable\nresults after training several days. For example, NSG-NFSP and Grasper get nothing after running\nfour days; NSGZero and Pretrained PSRO were trained for some iterations after running four days,\nbut their worst-case rewards are still almost 0.\nThese results show that existing algorithms still suffer performance and scalability issues in real-\nworld settings, which suggest that substantial efforts are still required to develop effective and effi-\ncient algorithms for solving real-world UNSGs.\n5\nRELATED WORKS\nGame theory has emerged as a valuable tool in addressing complex interactions and has been suc-\ncessfully applied to various security challenges (Jain et al., 2011; McCarthy et al., 2016; Sinha et al.,\n2018), including allocating limited resources to protect infrastructure (Jain et al., 2013) or design-\ning patrolling strategies in adversarial settings (Vorobeychik et al., 2014). Behind these results, one\nimportant model is Stackelberg Security Games (SSGs), which is used to solve a variety of security\nproblems (Sinha et al., 2018). In SSGs, the defender moves first and then the attacker best responds\nto the defender’s strategy. Then, the UNSG model is a special case of SSG, which is used in the\nzero-sum environment on networks.\nThe UNSG is similar to pursuit-evasion games (Parsons, 1976), where pursuers chase evaders. The\npursuit-evasion game involves strategic interactions between multiple pursuers and one or more\nevaders within a well-defined environment (Bilgin & Kadioglu-Urtis, 2015), presenting enduring\nchallenges and significant applications ranging from civilian safety (Oyler et al., 2016) to military\noperations (Vlahov et al., 2018). As a complex and widely-studied research problem, the pursuit-\nevasion game has been extensively applied across physics (Isaacs, 1965), mathematics (Pachter,\n1987; Kopparty & Ravishankar, 2005), and engineering (Eklund et al., 2011). The pursuit-evasion\ngames are often studied in the framework of differential games. Several canonical pursuit-evasion\ngames were first formulated as differential games and extensively studied by Rufus Isaacs in his\nmasterpiece “Differential Games” (Isaacs, 1965). Later, many studies focusing on pursuit-evasion\ngames emerged, and different algorithms were developed. For example, Ho et al. introduced the lin-\near–quadratic differential game (LQDG) formulation to address pursuit-evasion problems (Ho et al.,\n1965). In 1976, Parsons first used graphs to describe the pursuit-evasion games (Parsons, 1976).\nFrom the origins of the pursuit-evasion games until today, the game underwent several changes and\nnow constitutes a large family of problems. Researchers have also focused on pursuit-evasion games\nin a discrete setting in the past several decades. The discrete-time multiple-pursuer single-evader\ngame is solved (Bopardikar et al., 2008). Later, there are several works (Hor´ak & Boˇsansk`y, 2016;\nHor´ak et al., 2017; Hor´ak & Boˇsansk`y, 2017) focusing on one-sided partially observable pursuit-\nevasion games, in which the evader knows the pursuers’ locations while the pursuers do not know\nthe evader’s location. Similarly, the patrolling security game (PSG) (Basilico et al., 2009; Vorob-\neychik et al., 2014), where the defender defends against an unseen intruder, and the intruder needs\n9\nmultiple turns to perform the attack in the environment, is typically modeled as a stochastic game\nwith an infinite horizon. Later, PSGs were extended to cover cases where the defender receives an\nuncertain signal after being attacked and then goes to the point of being attacked to catch the attacker\n(Basilico et al., 2017a;c). More recently, a hierarchical framework has been presented for solving\ndiscrete stochastic pursuit-evasion games in large grid worlds (Guan et al., 2022). Our GraphChase\ncan be extended to cover these settings.\nExisting multiplayer benchmarks based on pursuit-evasion games, such as SIMPE (Talebi & Simaan,\n2018), Multi-Agent RL Benchmark (MARBLER) (Jain et al., 2011), and Avalon (Albrecht et al.,\n2022), have significantly advanced the field by offering diverse scenarios and testing environments.\nSIMPE, for instance, focuses on interactive simulation with varied strategies for multiple pursuers\nand a single evader, allowing for the exploration of cooperative and non-cooperative tactics (Talebi\n& Simaan, 2018). However, it outputs the coordinates of the pursuer and evader in the x-y plane,\nwith a continuous position space. And it does not take time information into account, overlook-\ning the temporal constraints inherent in UNSGs. Similarly, MARBLER integrates physical robot\ndynamics with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), bridging simulation with real-world\nrobot behavior (Jain et al., 2011). Avalon further extends these concepts by providing procedurally\ngenerated worlds aimed at testing the generalization capabilities of RL algorithms (Albrecht et al.,\n2022). However, It is designed to simulate biological survival skills (from basic actions like eat-\ning to complex behaviors like hunting and navigation). Google Research Football (Kurach et al.,\n2020) and Starcraft (Samvelyan et al., 2019) are MARL environments on a plane. Despite these\nadvances, these platforms primarily concentrate on MARL from an algorithmic development per-\nspective, often neglecting the nuanced game-theoretical aspects that can emerge in pursuit-evasion\ncontexts. Openspiel (Lanctot et al., 2019) is an established extensive collection of environments\nand algorithms for research in games. However, it mainly focuses on recreational games and does\nnot include pursuit-evasion games. Therefore, it results in a gap where the strategic, competitive,\nand cooperative elements integral to real-world applications of UNSGs need to be fully explored or\noptimized. Our GraphChase platform bridges the gap by building a flexible UNSG environment.\n6\nDISCUSSION: TESTBED FOR MULTIPLAYER GAMES\nComputing an NE in multiplayer games is generally hard (Chen & Deng, 2005; Zhang et al., 2023b),\nand designing efficient algorithms for computing such an NE is still an open challenge. Our platform\ncould be a testbed for algorithms for solving multiplayer games. In particular, our platform provides\nreal-world scenarios for adversarial team games (von Stengel & Koller, 1997; Basilico et al., 2017b;\nCelli & Gatti, 2018; Farina et al., 2018; Zhang & An, 2020a;b; Zhang et al., 2021; Farina et al.,\n2021; Zhang et al., 2022c;a;b; Zhang & Sandholm, 2022; Carminati et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023a;\nMcAleer et al., 2023; Anagnostides et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b), where a group of players competes\nagainst an adversary or another team. Various solution concepts apply depending on the situation.\nWhen team players compete independently against the adversary, the relevant solution concepts\ninclude 1) NE (Nash, 1951; Zhang et al., 2023b), where no player gains by deviating from this\nequilibrium, and 2) team-maxmin equilibrium (TME) (von Stengel & Koller, 1997; Basilico et al.,\n2017b; Celli & Gatti, 2018; Zhang & An, 2020a;b; Zhang et al., 2022c), which is a type of NE\nthat optimizes the team’s utility across all NEs. Based on our platform, if we set that pursuers\nindependently try to interdict the evader, we can also use our platform to compute an NE or TME in\nnormal-form or extensive-form games. For normal-form games where team players can coordinate\ntheir strategies, the applicable solution concept is the correlated team-maxmin equilibrium (CTME)\n(Basilico et al., 2017b). This is essentially equivalent to an NE in zero-sum two-player games, as\nthe team with coordinated strategies and a unified payoff function behaves like a single player. In\nextensive-form games, the team with coordinated strategies has two solution concepts: 1) team-\nmaxmin equilibrium with a communication device (TMECom) (Celli & Gatti, 2018), applicable\nwhen the team can continuously communicate and coordinate strategies, making the game akin to a\ntwo-player zero-sum game with perfect recall; and 2) team-maxmin equilibrium with a coordination\ndevice (TMECor) (Celli & Gatti, 2018; Zhang et al., 2021; 2024), used when the team can only\ncoordinate strategies before gameplay, rendering the game similar to a two-player zero-sum game\nwith imperfect recall. The algorithms in (Zhang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2021; Xue et al., 2021;\n2022; Li et al., 2023a; 2024) implemented on GraphChase compute a TMECom that is NE in team\nadversarial games. If we set that the team can only coordinate strategies before gameplay in the\nextensive-form games, we can also compute a TMECor on GraphChase.\n10\n7\nCONCLUSION\nWe present GraphChase, an open-source platform for UNSGs, offering researchers a flexible multi-\nplayer game environment to aid in developing scalable algorithms. Specifically, we first develop a\nunified and flexible UNSG environment and then implement several deep learning-based algorithms\nas benchmarks. Finally, we evaluate GraphChase and the results will provide insights into these\nalgorithms and further refine instruction for them. We hope our GraphChase platform can facilitate\nthe establishment of a standardized criterion for evaluating and improving algorithms for UNSGs,\nthereby contributing to the advancement of theoretical research and practical applications for solving\ngeneral multiplayer games.\nLimitation. Although we have implemented some state-of-the-art algorithms for solving UNSGs,\nthese algorithms still face significant challenges on performance and scalability. As the size and\ncomplexity of the UNSG increase, computing the best response strategy for each player becomes in-\ncreasingly time-consuming and computationally expensive. Existing algorithms struggle to scale up\nas they typically require multiple computations of the best response strategy, which can be resource-\nintensive. Our GraphChase platform has been designed to facilitate to address these challenges by\nproviding a large-scale game environment. However, despite its advanced capabilities, our plat-\nform still has some limitations that we aim to address in future works. First, the abstract nature of\ngraph-based models may not accurately capture all the dynamic and unpredictable elements of real-\nworld environments, such as variable traffic patterns and spontaneous human behaviors. Second,\nGraphChase may struggle to adapt to rapid changes in urban settings, such as emergencies or unex-\npected social events, which can alter game dynamics and require immediate strategic adjustments.\n11\nREFERENCES\nJoshua Albrecht, Abraham Fetterman, Bryden Fogelman, Ellie Kitanidis, Bartosz Wr´oblewski,\nNicole Seo, Michael Rosenthal, Maksis Knutins, Zack Polizzi, James Simon, et al.\nAvalon:\nA benchmark for rl generalization using procedurally generated worlds.

In our platform, users can configure a\nrange of parameters depending on the type of graph utilized: Grid Graph or Custom Graph.\nFor the Grid Graph, the underlying graph structure can be controlled through parameters such\nas column and row, which define the grid’s dimensions, as well as side exist prob and\ndiagonal exist prob, which determine the probabilities of edges existing between adjacent\nnodes and diagonal nodes, respectively. For the Custom Graph, the underlying structure is specified\nvia an adjacency matrix, allowing users to define a completely customized graph topology.\nIn both graph types, users can also control parameters related to the agent number and positions,\nincluding max time horizon, which defines the maximum simulation duration; pursuer num\nand evader num, specifying the number of pursuer and evader agents; and exit num, which\nsets the number of exits in the graph.\nAdditionally, initial positions for agents and exits can\nbe customized through pursuer initial position, evader initial position, and\nexit position, enabling users to tailor the simulation to specific scenarios.\nD\nEXPERIMENTS ON OTHER SETTINGS\nWe conducted experiments on a 15 × 15 grid graph to evaluate the performance of our platform in\ncomparison to existing environments. While CFR-MIX (Li et al., 2021), NSG-NFSP (Xue et al.,\n2021), and NSGZero (Xue et al., 2022) utilize the 15×15 grid graph, we found that specific settings,\nincluding the positions of pursuers, the evader, and exits, were not clearly given in their works. To\nensure a fair evaluation, we adopted uniform settings for training policies across both the original\ncode and GraphChase. There are four pursuers and ten exits for an evader. The max time horizon is\n15. The same settings allow for a direct comparison of the effectiveness of our platform against the\noriginal paper.\n17\nWe also extracted two real-world maps of Singapore with 372 nodes and Manhattan with 620 nodes\nand developed two large-scale UNSGs based on these maps. Experiments conducted on the Sin-\ngapore map have been previously tested in NSG-NFSP (Xue et al., 2021), NSGZero (Xue et al.,\n2022), Pretrained PSRO (Li et al., 2023a), and Grasper (Li et al., 2024). Manhattan map was tested\nin NSG-NFSP (Xue et al., 2021), and NSGZero (Xue et al., 2022). However, specific settings for\nthese two maps were not detailed in prior studies. For our simulations, we designated four pursuers\nand ten exits for the evader, with a time horizon set to 15 on the Singapore map. And there are six\npursuers and ten exits for the evader, with a time horizon set to 15 on the Manhattan map. To ensure\na fair comparison, we adopted the same settings for the original code and GraphChase3.

This change results in faster simulation processes and eliminates\nredundant data copying operations, leading to improved efficiency.\nAdditionally, we have implemented various code optimizations to enhance the platform’s perfor-\nmance. These include improved data type conversions, such as using numpy-to-tensor conversions\ninstead of list-to-tensor operations, which reduces processing time. We have also focused on enhanc-\ning memory management throughout the platform, resulting in more efficient resource utilization.\nFrom the perspective of wall-clock time, this indeed accelerates the convergence speed. However,\nit’s crucial to note that in terms of the number of training iterations required for convergence, there\nis no significant improvement. For instance, if the original code necessitates sampling 104 episodes\nto initiate convergence, our platform’s reproduced algorithms similarly require approximately the\nsame number of training iterations. This consistency in training iterations is attributable to the fact\nthat we have not altered the underlying algorithms themselves.\nUnlike the original implementation, our platform is designed with modular components, making\nit unsuitable to directly compare the performance of individual components against the original\ncode. However, to emphasize the efficiency of our platform in simulation processes, we conducted\nexperiments to evaluate the time required for a single episode of simulation and the subsequent\ndata-saving process for each algorithm. The performance comparison between GraphChase and the\n3Due to the extended training time required for the CFR-MIX algorithm, we did not conduct tests for CFR-\nMIX.\n18\noriginal implementation, highlighting the significant speed improvements achieved by our platform,\nis presented in Table 5.\nNSG-NFSP\nNSGZero\nPretrained PSRO\nGrasper\nGraphChase\n0.0089 ± 0.005\n0.378 ± 0.12\n0.0065 ± 0.002\n0.0097 ± 0.002\nOriginal Code\n0.0187 ± 0.005\n0.523 ± 0.15\n0.0153 ± 0.004\n0.0178 ± 0.002\nTable 5: Performance comparison between Original Code and GraphChase in terms of simulation\nand data-saving time (in seconds).

In this scenario, a Nash equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time based on\nthe size of the extensive-form game (Shoham & Leyton-Brown, 2008). Recent significant achieve-\nments, such as achieving superhuman performance in the heads-up no-limit Texas hold’em poker\ngame (Moravˇc´ık et al., 2017; Brown & Sandholm, 2018), demonstrate that researchers have a good\nunderstanding of the problem of computing a Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum extensive-\nform games, both in theory and in practice. However, the problem of computing a Nash equilibrium\nin multiplayer games is not as well understood, as it is generally a challenging task (Chen & Deng,\n2005; Zhang et al., 2023b). Therefore, more and more AI researchers focus on solving multiplayer\ngames (Brown & Sandholm, 2019; FAIR et al., 2022; Carminati et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023a;\nMcAleer et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024)\nTo facilitate the development of designing efficient learning algorithms for solving multiplayer\ngames, we propose a multiplayer game platform for solving Urban Network Security Games\n(UNSGs) that model the following real-world situations. In urban areas, ensuring public safety\nand security is crucial for law enforcement agencies. One significant challenge they face is the high\nnumber of innocent bystanders who are injured or killed during police pursuits (Rivara & Mack,\n2004). It’s essential to develop effective strategies that allow multiple officers to apprehend fleeing\ncriminals while minimizing risks to civilians and property damage. This paper focuses on respond-\ning to major incidents such as terrorist attacks or bank robberies, where police officers need to\nswiftly intercept the attackers during their escape. This requires efficient strategies for apprehending\nfleeing criminals, which can be analyzed and developed using structured approaches like UNSGs.\nHowever, solving UNSGs is NP-hard (Jain et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2017; 2019). More specifi-\ncally, the strategy space of players in UNSGs cannot be enumerated due to the memory constraint of\ncomputers (Jain et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2019). Moreover, if players do not have real-time informa-\ntion, they have to make decisions with imperfect information. In addition, if police officers cannot\ncommunicate during the game play, they have to make decisions independently. Finally, UNSGs\nincorporate cooperation between police officers and competition between the criminal and team of\npolice officers. To address the above challenges, previous efforts have been made to tackle UNSGs.\nThat is, they extended the Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) (Zinkevich et al., 2008) to\nCFR-MIX algorithm (Li et al., 2021), incorporating deep learning enhancements from Deep CFR\n(Brown et al., 2019). Additionally, they utilized the Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP) approach\n(Heinrich & Silver, 2016), further developed into NSG-NFSP (Xue et al., 2021) and NSGZero (Xue\net al., 2022), which are tailored to solving UNSGs under the NFSP framework. Moreover, they ex-\ntended the learning framework, Policy-Space Response Oracles (PSRO) (Lanctot et al., 2017), to an\nadvanced variant Pretrained PSRO (Li et al., 2023a) to speed up. Finally, they developed Grasper (Li\net al., 2024) based on Pretrained PSRO, an innovative algorithm that can generalize across different\ngame settings. All of them are based on the state-of-the-art game-theoretical algorithm frameworks.\n2\nHowever, these efforts are still hampered by performance and scalability issues, as shown in our\nexperiments.\nTo foster the development of scalable algorithms capable of addressing city-scale UNSGs, we pro-\npose the creation of an open-source platform, GraphChase, specifically tailored for UNSG. The\narchitecture of GraphChase is depicted in Figure 1, designed to provide researchers with a com-\nprehensive UNSG platform and facilitate the development and evaluation of scalable strategy for\npursuers. Specifically, we made the following contributions: i) Development of a unified and flex-\nible UNSG environment: We developed a versatile platform designed to support various configu-\nrations of UNSGs. Specifically, this environment allows for modifying game parameters, enabling\nresearchers to simulate different real-world UNSG scenarios under various conditions. The inherent\nflexibility of GraphChase supports a wide range of experimental setups, from small-scale laboratory\nexperiments to city-wide simulations. All these make GraphChase a suitable tool for theoretical re-\nsearch and practical application testing. ii) Implementation of learning algorithms: GraphChase\nis designed to facilitate the execution of a wide range of algorithms. Based on the standardized\nplatform, we successfully implement several advanced deep learning-based algorithms, enabling\nthe consistent comparison of different strategic approaches. By efficiently integrating algorithms\nwithin the platform, it reduces the time overhead of the simulation resulting in faster convergence\nfrom the perspective of wall-clock time. And iii) Benchmark results: We conduct experiments on\nUNSGs with synthetic and real-world graphs to evaluate the performance of the different algorithms\nimplemented on the GraphChase platform. The results from these experiments are recorded and\ncompiled into comprehensive benchmarks. Our results show that, although previous algorithms can\nachieve reasonable performance, they still suffer performance and scalability issues in real-world\nsettings. These results suggest that substantial efforts are still required to develop effective and ef-\nficient algorithms for solving real-world UNSGs. We believe that GraphChase not only facilitates\nthe development of efficient algorithms for solving real-world problems but also paves the way for\nsignificant advancements in algorithmic development for solving general multiplayer games.\n2\nURBAN NETWORK SECURITY GAMES\nMotivated by the security games on urban roads (Jain et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2017; 2019), we\nproposed our GraphChase platform for solving UNSGs that model the interactions between multiple\npursuers (police officers) and an evader (criminal). The variants of UNSGs can model different real-\nworld settings, e.g., whether real-time information is available, whether pursuers can communicate.\nNow, we introduce the definition of these games.\n2.1\nGAME DEFINITION\nTake, for instance, the scenario where pursuers are tasked with capturing an evader escaping on\nurban roads. We introduce the concept of UNSGs. First, urban roads and pathways naturally lend\nthemselves to being modeled as graphs, where intersections and streets form nodes and edges, re-\nspectively. The graph can be represented by G = (V, E), where V is a set of vertices, and E is a\nset of edges. In UNSGs, graphs can be directed or undirected, corresponding to one-way streets and\ntwo-way streets, and weighted or unweighted, where the weight can be used to reflect different travel\ncosts or terrains. This graphical representation allows for a structured and systematic approach to\nsimulating the complex dynamics of urban pursuits. Specifically, in graph G, we use a subset of the\nvertex set, Eexit ⊂E, to represent the set of exit nodes from which the criminal can escape. For\neach vertex v ∈V , we use N(v) to represent the set of neighbours of v.\nIn UNSGs, the pursuer and the evader are represented as agents moving across a network.\nIt\nis important to note that the evader and the pursuer can be a single agent or consist of multi-\nple agents. For example, several pursuers would collaborate to chase a single evader or chase a\nteam of evaders. Formally, the set of players N = (p, e), where p = (p1, p2, ..., pn), n ≥1\nrepresents pursuers and e = (e1, e2, ..., en), n ≥1 represents the evader. Since the pursuers can\nblock all exit nodes for a certain period, we can predefine the length of the lockdown. Formally,\nlet T represent the number of steps in which the game terminates and lp\n0 = (lp1\n0 , lp2\n0 , ..., lpn\n0 ),\nle\n0 = (le1\n0 , le2\n0 , ..., len\n0 ) represent the initial locations of the evader and the pursuer, respectively.\nAt each step, each player in the game would move from vertex v to one of its neighborhood\nvertices w ∈N(v). Specifically, at game step t < T, the locations of the evader and the pur-\nsuer, respectively, are lp\nt = (lp1\nt , lp2\nt , ..., lpn\nt ), le\nt = (le1\nt , le2\nt , ..., len\nt ). Then the available action\n3\nset of the pursuer is a Cartesian product of the sets of neighboring vertices of each evader, i.e.,\nAp(h) = {(lp1, lp2, ..., lpn)|li ∈N(li\nt), ∀i ∈{p1, p2, ..., pn}}. Similarly, the available action set of\nthe evader is Ae(h) = {(le1, le2, ..., len)|li ∈N(li\nt), ∀i ∈{e1, e2, ..., en}}. All players act simulta-\nneously at game step t, i.e., the pursuer and the evader select actions from their action sets. Then all\nplayers move from lp\nt and le\nt to lp\nt+1 and le\nt+1, respectively. We can also convert the simultaneous-\nmove game into a turn-based game by ignoring the selected action of the first-act player when the\nsecond player acts. This process repeats until a termination condition is met. The evader is con-\nsidered caught if the evader and any of the pursuers occupy the same point at any time within the\nmaximum time horizon. The termination conditions of the game include: (i) the pursuer catches\nthe evader (i.e., all criminals); (ii) the evader (i.e., all criminals) escapes from exit nodes; and (iii)\nthe game reaches the predefined game step T, i.e., t = T. In cases (i) and (iii) the pursuer wins.\nOtherwise, if the evader successfully escapes to the outside world, the evader wins. Based on these\nresults, each player gets their corresponding rewards.\n2.2\nINFORMATION AND STRATEGY\nIn different real-world cases, the pursuer and evader may access various information, i.e., the loca-\ntion information of each player. With the aid of tracking devices, such as the StarChase GPS-based\nsystem (Gaither et al., 2017), police officers can get the real-time location of the criminal. In another\ncase, the police officers may not know the ability of the criminal. To avoid the worst case, the police\nofficers usually assume that the criminal can get the real-time location of the police officers. There-\nfore, there are four cases: i) the evader can get the real-time location information of the pursuer\nwhile the pursuer cannot get the real-time location information of the evader; ii) the pursuer can get\nthe real-time location information of the evader while the evader cannot get the real-time location\ninformation of the pursuer; iii) both the evader and the pursuer can get the real-time location infor-\nmation of the opponent; and iv) both the evader and the pursuer cannot get the real-time location\ninformation.\nMoreover, if pursuers cannot communicate during the game play, they have to make decisions in-\ndependently. However, if pursuers can communicate during the game play, they can correlate their\nactions. Using this case as an example, based on the available real-time location information, the\nbehavior strategy σe or σp is a function that maps every decision point to a probability distribution\nover the available action set. Then, a strategy profile σ is a tuple of one strategy for each player, i.e.,\nσ = (σp, σe). The pursuer’s payoff function is up(σp, σe) ∈R with up(σp, σe) = −ue(σp, σe) for\nthe evader. We adopt the Nash equilibrium (NE) (Nash, 1950) as the solution concept for this case\nsince the NE strategy profile is a steady state in which no player can increase its utility by unilater-\nally deviating. In our GraphChase platform, we consider the NE strategy of the pursuer would be\nthe optimal strategy and take the worst-case utility of the pursuer as the measure for the pursuer’s\nstrategy, i.e., maxσp∈Σp minσe∈Σe up(σp, σe).\n2.3\nCHALLENGES\nIn UNSGs, pursuers are tasked with capturing an evader escaping on urban roads. The network-\nbased environment could lead to the strategy space of players in UNSGs cannot be enumerated due\nto the memory constraint of computers (Jain et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2019). That is, if a player’s\nstrategy is a path, then we cannot enumerate all paths due to memory constraints in large-scale\nUNSGs. In fact, even with the relatively simple setting where the time dynamics are ignored, and\nthe pursuers can correlate their actions, the problem of solving UNSGs is still very hard (Jain et al.,\n2011). We could expect that solving UNSGs will be harder in more complicated settings.\nMoreover, some UNSGs operate under conditions of imperfect information when real-time infor-\nmation is not available. In some cases, players possess asymmetric knowledge about the state of the\nenvironment. In some UNSGs, the escaping evader location and potential strategies might not be\nfully known to the pursuers in some scenarios, and conversely, the evader may have limited informa-\ntion about the evader locations. The partial observability also poses unique challenges for addressing\nthe UNSGs. In some cases, the maximum number of time steps may not be predicted accurately.\nTherefore, it necessitates the development of robust algorithms capable of making decisions based\non imperfect data and under uncertainty, requiring sophisticated decision-making processes akin to\nthose used in real-world scenarios.\n4\nEnvironment\nGame Module\nGraph, initial point, time horizon,…\nPursuer\nRunner\nEvader\nRunner\nAgent Module\n…\nPursuer\nPolicy\nEvader\nPolicy\n…\nPSRO\nBased\nMethod\nSolver.solve()\nPSRO.solve()\nAlgorithms\nCFR-MIX\nNSG-NFSP\nNSGZero\nPretrained \nPSRO\nGrasper\n……\nfor iter in range(iterations):\n         add_new_evader()\nadd_new_pursuer()\nupdate_meta_game()\ncompute_meta_strategy()\n……\n…….\nfor episode in range(episodes):\n          obs, info = env.reset()\nwhile not done:\n                    evader.get_action()\n                    pursuer.get_action()\n                    env.step()\n          pursuer.train()\n          evader.train()\n……\nSolver Module\nYes\nNo\nUpdate\nNew Policy\nFigure 2: The core structure and workflow of GraphChase.\nFurthermore, pursuers cannot communicate during the game play in some UNSGs, and then they\nhave to make decisions independently. This case is similar to general multiplayer games, where NE\nis commonly used as a solution concept. However, computing an NE is hard generally (Chen &\nDeng, 2005; Zhang et al., 2023b).\nIn addition, the UNSG, inherently a zero-sum game, involves direct competition between the pur-\nsuers and the escaping evader, where one’s gain is precisely the other’s loss, reflecting the purely\nadversarial nature of their interactions. Concurrently, profound cooperation within the team of pur-\nsuers is also essential. pursuers must work together seamlessly to effectively capture the escaping\nevader. The pursuers share the same utility function, aiming collectively to minimize the escape pos-\nsibilities of the evader. This blend of competitive and cooperative elements introduces significant\ncomplexities in solving UNSGs. The dual nature of interactions demands algorithms that can han-\ndle both aspects simultaneously—optimizing competitive moves against the escaping evader while\ncoordinating strategies among multiple pursuers.\nThese elements—combined competitive and cooperative dynamics, along with the challenge of op-\nerating under imperfect information or independent moves — make the UNSG an exemplary bench-\nmark for assessing the effectiveness of algorithms in complex and unpredictable environments. By\nproviding a platform that mimics the diverse scales and complexities of UNSGs, GraphChase offers\na valuable tool for advancing the development of scalable algorithms.\n3\nPLATFORM: GRAPHCHASE\nAs shown in Figure 1, GraphChase provides template scripts for quick-start, and, once completed by\nthe user, it carries out training and testing procedures for comparison. Results, such as the worst-case\nreward, are generated and available for review.\n3.1\nCORE COMPONENTS\nOur GraphChase platform features a flexible game environment specifically designed to facilitate\ncomprehensive simulations of UNSGs. The parameters that users can control to generate the graph\nstructure are detailed in Appendix C. There is a brief introduction about how to use GraphChase in\nAppendix F. At the core of this environment is a versatile system architecture, as depicted in Figure\n2, which clearly outlines the primary components and their interactions within the platform. The\nmodular architecture comprising the Game Environment, Agent, and Solver components enhances\nplatform versatility, facilitating both adaptation to diverse research requirements and integration\nof various algorithmic approaches. This modular design architecture enables researchers to easily\ncustomization and scale their own problems.\n5\nGame Module. To enhance the flexibility of our platform, GraphChase is designed to support\nextensive customization of game parameters, enabling users to simulate different UNSG scenar-\nios tailored to their specific demands. This customization capability includes several key features.\nFirst, users have the option to design or import their graphs for simulation. This could range from\nsimple, manually-generated grid diagrams to more complex real-world urban layouts, such as the\nSingapore road map. Any graph format can be transformed into an adjacency list as the input to\nthe game generation function. This feature allows researchers to explore UNSG in simulations that\nare directly relevant to their specific areas of study or practical application needs. Second, users\ncan specify key strategic points within the graph, such as initial positions of the pursuer and the\nevader, and exit nodes. This level of customization not only adds complexity and variability to the\nsimulations but also allows for testing strategies under different initial conditions and escape routes,\nmaking each game unique even when played on the same graph. Third, the platform supports cus-\ntomization of the time horizon for each game, accommodating both quick resolutions and longer\nstrategic engagements. Fourth, since GraphChase is based on the Gymnasium library, the amount\nand type of information accessible to each player can be easily adjusted by users via the API of gym-\nnasium.Env.step(). This feature allows the evader and the pursuer to have limited visibility of each\nother’s locations and moves, creating more realistic scenarios that closely replicate the information\nasymmetry often found in real-world situations. In conclusion, by allowing users to freely define the\nstructure of the graph, GraphChase enables a broad spectrum of simulation possibilities. The flexi-\nbility of GraphChase allows users to meticulously design games that meet their specific research or\noperational requirements. Furthermore, through integration with the Gymnasium library, users can\nsignificantly reduce the time to learn and utilize GraphChase, while also leveraging various Gym-\nnasium wrappers to conveniently run environments in parallel and visualize the performance of the\ntrained models.\nAgent Module. The Agent Module consists of two parts: the agent policy and the agent runner.\nThe policy refers to the algorithms adopted by the agent, such as PPO, MAPPO, and NSGZero.\nThe agent runner is responsible for simulation in the environment against opponents and uses the\nobtained data to update the agent policy. Specifically, an agent runner must have a get action(data)\nmethod, where data is a tuple providing the input required for the agent policy to generate actions.\nThe actions made by the policy are returned as the output of the get action() method. Additionally, if\nthe agent needs to improve its policy (not necessary in some cases, such as random strategies), it must\nhave a train() method. Users can freely define this method according to the requirements of their\ndesigned algorithms. In summary, with this agent module structure, users can customize pursuers\nand evaders adopting various algorithms and can easily integrate with the Game module introduced\nearlier and the solver module discussed later in the paper. This flexible structure provides a rich\ntesting ground for developing both defensive and offensive strategies within the game environment,\nallowing users to test the performance of different algorithms efficiently.\nSolver Module. The Solver module of our GraphChase platform encompasses a variety of al-\ngorithms designed to address UNSGs, aiming to facilitate users in comparing the performance of\nvarious algorithms. Given that the current state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Pretrained PSRO\nand Grasper, are based on the PSRO framework, we have integrated the PSRO learning framework\nwithin our platform to solve UNSGs. Users merely need to define the training methods for both\nthe pursuer runner and the evader runner and provide the environment with parameters to initialize\nthe PSRO algorithm. By designing the code structure in this manner, users can freely modify the\nalgorithms used by the pursuer, such as PPO or MAPPO, and seamlessly integrate them within the\nPSRO framework, thereby maximizing code reusability. Additionally, if users design a new learning\nframework and want to compare its performance to PSRO, they only need to define the environment\nand agents as introduced before, then a training task can be easily started.\n3.2\nBENCHMARK ALGORITHMS\nBased on our GraphChase platform, we have implemented several deep-learning algorithms that\nsolve UNSGs. Here, we provide a brief overview of these algorithms and outline their operational\nprocess within our platform, as illustrated in Figure 2.\nTo address the inherent challenges of imperfect information in UNSGs, we integrate several sophis-\nticated algorithms into GraphChase. It includes: 1) CFR-MIX algorithm (Li et al., 2021), incorpo-\nrating deep learning enhancements (Brown et al., 2019) based on counterfactual regret minimization\n6\n(CFR) (Zinkevich et al., 2008); 2) NSG-NFSP (Xue et al., 2021) based on the neural fictitious self-\nplay approach (Heinrich & Silver, 2016); 3) NSGZero (Xue et al., 2022) based on neural Monte\nCarlo tree search; 4) Variants of the PSRO framework (Lanctot et al., 2017): Pretrained PSRO (Li\net al., 2023a) and Grasper (Li et al., 2024). Figure 2 illustrates the operational process of these\nalgorithms within our GraphChase platform.\nEach algorithm is implemented to integrate with the game’s underlying mechanics through well-\ndefined interfaces, ensuring they can operate effectively within the platform’s architecture. Firstly,\nby inputting the initial positions of agents and the time horizon of the game, we set up the game\nenvironment. Simultaneously, we initialize the pursuer runner according to the solver algorithms, as\nshown in the yellow frame. Then, depending on whether the chosen algorithm requires the PSRO\nlearning framework, different solving processes are employed. If the PSRO framework is not re-\nquired, the solver.solve() method is executed. In this method, the evader and pursuer runner interact\ncontinuously with the environment to generate data, which is then used to update the policy network,\nproducing new strategies. If the PSRO framework is used, the PSRO.solve() method is executed.\nDuring each iteration, the opponent’s strategy is alternately fixed, and a best response to the oppo-\nnent is generated. The meta game is then updated based on the simulation results, and the current\npolicy oracle’s meta strategy is computed. Subsequently, the runner’s policies are updated, and the\nprocess proceeds to the next training cycle.\nEvaluation. In our platform, the primary objective is to compute the optimal defense strategy for\nthe pursuer, akin to strategizing the most effective tactics for police officers in realistic scenarios.\nUpon determining the pursuer’s strategy through any of the algorithms available on the platform,\nwe adopt the worst-case utility as our principal evaluation metric. As introduced before, to compute\nthe worst-case utility, we first identify the best response strategy of the evader against the pursuer’s\nstrategy being evaluated. Then, we compute the pursuer’s worst-case utility by simulating the game\nusing the pursuer’s strategy and the best response strategy of the evader. This evaluation method\nhelps ensure that the strategy is not only theoretically sound but also practically viable under the\nmost demanding conditions.\n4\nEXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION\nWe conduct experiments to evaluate GraphChase and show the issues of existing algorithms.\n4.1\nEXPERIMENTAL SETTING\nWe conduct the following three sets of experiments for the experimental evaluation. 1) To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of GraphChase, we compare the training procedure of algorithms implemented in\nGraphChase with the training procedure of algorithms implemented by the original authors1. 2) To\nevaluate the performance of existing algorithms, we calculate the reward (the probability of catching\nthe evader) of the pursuer in the worst-case setting. That is, the pursuer’s policy in a trained model\nwill be played against all available paths of the evader, and the worst-case reward will be the reward\nof this model. 3) To evaluate the scalability of existing algorithms, we run these algorithms to solve\nrealistic and large games.\nWe run the first two sets of experiments on the following two games shown in Appendix A. The first\ngame is easier to solve as the evader will be caught with a probability of 1 (ground truth), but the\nsecond game is harder to solve as the evader will only be caught with a probability of 0.5 (ground\ntruth). Both games are run on a 7 × 7 grid network with four exits, four pursuers, and one evader. In\nthe first set of experiments, we set T = 6. In the second set of experiments, we evaluate the pursuers’\ntrained model in the first set of experiments against all paths of the evader with the maximum length\nof each path as 6 and 12, respectively. Finally, we conducted a third set of experiments on a game\nset in a 100 × 100 grid network with a maximum time horizon of T = 200. In this scenario, four\npursuers attempt to capture a single evader who is trying to escape successfully through one of 12\nexit nodes.\n1Codes were shared by the original authors of these algorithms.\n7\n4.2\nBENCHMARK RESULTS\nThe Effectiveness of GraphChase. The results of the evaluation of GraphChase are shown in\nFigures 3 and 4 (Results for other algorithms are in Appendix B). We can see that the algorithms\nbased on our GraphChase perform similarly to the algorithms based on the original codes. In most\ncases, we can see that algorithms based on GraphChase converge faster than the algorithms based\non the original codes, which shows the effectiveness and efficiency of our GraphChase.2\nTo further verify that algorithms based on GraphChase can recover the performance of the algorithms\nbased on the original codes with significantly less time, we first show that our algorithms based on\nGraphChase can recover the performance of the algorithms based on the original codes in a variety\nof scenarios used in the UNSG domain (Xue et al., 2021; 2022; Li et al., 2023a; 2024) in Appendix\nD. These networks, including the 15 × 15 grid network, the real-world Singapore map, and the real-\nworld Manhattan map, are representatives because the 15 × 15 grid network represents the randomly\ngenerated network, and two real-world networks represent different topological structures in real-\nworld cities. Then, in Appendix E, we show that algorithms based on GraphChase run significantly\nfaster than algorithms based on the original codes in terms of simulation and data-saving time, and\nwe explain the reasons behind the faster convergence of GraphChase.\n0\n10000\n20000\n30000\n40000\n50000\n60000\nRun Time (seconds)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nPursuer Reward\nOriginal code\nGraphChase\n(a) NSG-NFSP\n2500\n5000\n7500\n10000\n12500\n15000\n17500\n20000\n22500\nRun Time (seconds)\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nPursuer Reward\nOriginal code\nGraphChase\n(b) Pretrained PSRO\n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\n20000\nRun Time (seconds)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nPursuer Reward\nOriginal code\nGraphChase\n(c) Grasper\nFigure 3: The training procedure on the easy game with a caught probability of 1.\n0\n10000\n20000\n30000\n40000\n50000\n60000\nRun Time (seconds)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nPursuer Reward\nOriginal code\nGraphChase\n(a) NSG-NFSP\n2500\n5000\n7500\n10000\n12500\n15000\n17500\n20000\nRun Time (seconds)\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nPursuer Reward\nOriginal code\nGraphChase\n(b) Pretrained PSRO\n0\n10000\n20000\n30000\n40000\nRun Time (seconds)\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\n0.50\nPursuer Reward\nOriginal code\nGraphChase\n(c) Grasper\nFigure 4: The training procedure on the hard game with a caught probability of 0.5.\nThe Performance Issue of Existing Algorithms. The performance evaluation of existing algo-\nrithms for solving UNSGs is shown in Table 1. We can see that if an algorithm converges during\ntraining, it will perform well for solving the easy game (with a caught probability of 1) but may not\nperform well for solving the hard game (with a caught probability of 0.5). Increasing the maximum\nlength of the evader’s paths also will damage the performance.\nThe main reason is that, when the evader does not have real-time location information of pursuers,\ncomputing the evader’s best response against the strategy of pursuers is a very hard sparse-reward\nproblem, which involves finding an escape path from the initial location to an exit node. To simplify\nthis problem, almost all existing algorithms use the following best response approach of the evader:\nThe evader first chooses an exit node and then randomly takes a simple (acyclic) path that guarantees\nreaching the chosen exit node before exceeding the maximum time horizon. This approach reduces\nthe strategy space of the evader but cannot provide the true best response strategy for the evader.\nIn addition, due to the above-mentioned challenge, almost all existing algorithms assume that the\nmaximum length of the evader paths is short during training. Then, the strategy of pursuers may be\nexploited if the evader takes a longer path.\n2CFR-MIX and NSGZero solved games on 5 × 5 network with T = 4 because they run too slow.\n8\nMaximum length of paths for evaluation\nAlgorithm\nTraining\nT = 6\nT = 6\nT = 12\nT = 12\nPretrained PSRO\n2h\/1.5h\n0.01\n0.93\n0.01\n0.92\nGrasper\n7.7h\/2.5h\n0.12\n0.97\n0.05\n0.95\nNSG-NFSP\n5.5h\/3.3h\n0.03\n0.59\n0.03\n0.57\nNSGZero\n18h\/18h\n0.03\n0.06\n0.03\n0.05\nNSGZero (T = 3)\n11.3h\/7h\n0.01\n0.32\n0.0\n0.19\nNSGZero (5 × 5)\n1.8h\/1h\n0.42\n1\n0.39\n0.94\nCFR-MIX (5 × 5)\n6.9h\/6.3h\n0.03\n0.38\n0.01\n0.16\nGround Truth\nhard(0.5)\/easy(1)\n0.5\n1\n0.5\n1\nTable 1: The performance of existing algorithms in the worst-case setting. For the grid network, the\nmaximum length of the evader’s paths for evaluation is T = 4 or T = 8.\nThe Scalability Issue of Existing Algorithms. From the first set of experiments above, we can\nsee that the existing algorithms require several hours to converge for solving small games, as shown\nin Table 1. For solving this large game with a 100 × 100 grid network, we cannot see reasonable\nresults after training several days. For example, NSG-NFSP and Grasper get nothing after running\nfour days; NSGZero and Pretrained PSRO were trained for some iterations after running four days,\nbut their worst-case rewards are still almost 0.\nThese results show that existing algorithms still suffer performance and scalability issues in real-\nworld settings, which suggest that substantial efforts are still required to develop effective and effi-\ncient algorithms for solving real-world UNSGs.\n5\nRELATED WORKS\nGame theory has emerged as a valuable tool in addressing complex interactions and has been suc-\ncessfully applied to various security challenges (Jain et al., 2011; McCarthy et al., 2016; Sinha et al.,\n2018), including allocating limited resources to protect infrastructure (Jain et al., 2013) or design-\ning patrolling strategies in adversarial settings (Vorobeychik et al., 2014). Behind these results, one\nimportant model is Stackelberg Security Games (SSGs), which is used to solve a variety of security\nproblems (Sinha et al., 2018). In SSGs, the defender moves first and then the attacker best responds\nto the defender’s strategy. Then, the UNSG model is a special case of SSG, which is used in the\nzero-sum environment on networks.\nThe UNSG is similar to pursuit-evasion games (Parsons, 1976), where pursuers chase evaders. The\npursuit-evasion game involves strategic interactions between multiple pursuers and one or more\nevaders within a well-defined environment (Bilgin & Kadioglu-Urtis, 2015), presenting enduring\nchallenges and significant applications ranging from civilian safety (Oyler et al., 2016) to military\noperations (Vlahov et al., 2018). As a complex and widely-studied research problem, the pursuit-\nevasion game has been extensively applied across physics (Isaacs, 1965), mathematics (Pachter,\n1987; Kopparty & Ravishankar, 2005), and engineering (Eklund et al., 2011). The pursuit-evasion\ngames are often studied in the framework of differential games. Several canonical pursuit-evasion\ngames were first formulated as differential games and extensively studied by Rufus Isaacs in his\nmasterpiece “Differential Games” (Isaacs, 1965). Later, many studies focusing on pursuit-evasion\ngames emerged, and different algorithms were developed. For example, Ho et al. introduced the lin-\near–quadratic differential game (LQDG) formulation to address pursuit-evasion problems (Ho et al.,\n1965). In 1976, Parsons first used graphs to describe the pursuit-evasion games (Parsons, 1976).\nFrom the origins of the pursuit-evasion games until today, the game underwent several changes and\nnow constitutes a large family of problems. Researchers have also focused on pursuit-evasion games\nin a discrete setting in the past several decades. The discrete-time multiple-pursuer single-evader\ngame is solved (Bopardikar et al., 2008). Later, there are several works (Hor´ak & Boˇsansk`y, 2016;\nHor´ak et al., 2017; Hor´ak & Boˇsansk`y, 2017) focusing on one-sided partially observable pursuit-\nevasion games, in which the evader knows the pursuers’ locations while the pursuers do not know\nthe evader’s location. Similarly, the patrolling security game (PSG) (Basilico et al., 2009; Vorob-\neychik et al., 2014), where the defender defends against an unseen intruder, and the intruder needs\n9\nmultiple turns to perform the attack in the environment, is typically modeled as a stochastic game\nwith an infinite horizon. Later, PSGs were extended to cover cases where the defender receives an\nuncertain signal after being attacked and then goes to the point of being attacked to catch the attacker\n(Basilico et al., 2017a;c). More recently, a hierarchical framework has been presented for solving\ndiscrete stochastic pursuit-evasion games in large grid worlds (Guan et al., 2022). Our GraphChase\ncan be extended to cover these settings.\nExisting multiplayer benchmarks based on pursuit-evasion games, such as SIMPE (Talebi & Simaan,\n2018), Multi-Agent RL Benchmark (MARBLER) (Jain et al., 2011), and Avalon (Albrecht et al.,\n2022), have significantly advanced the field by offering diverse scenarios and testing environments.\nSIMPE, for instance, focuses on interactive simulation with varied strategies for multiple pursuers\nand a single evader, allowing for the exploration of cooperative and non-cooperative tactics (Talebi\n& Simaan, 2018). However, it outputs the coordinates of the pursuer and evader in the x-y plane,\nwith a continuous position space. And it does not take time information into account, overlook-\ning the temporal constraints inherent in UNSGs. Similarly, MARBLER integrates physical robot\ndynamics with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), bridging simulation with real-world\nrobot behavior (Jain et al., 2011). Avalon further extends these concepts by providing procedurally\ngenerated worlds aimed at testing the generalization capabilities of RL algorithms (Albrecht et al.,\n2022). However, It is designed to simulate biological survival skills (from basic actions like eat-\ning to complex behaviors like hunting and navigation). Google Research Football (Kurach et al.,\n2020) and Starcraft (Samvelyan et al., 2019) are MARL environments on a plane. Despite these\nadvances, these platforms primarily concentrate on MARL from an algorithmic development per-\nspective, often neglecting the nuanced game-theoretical aspects that can emerge in pursuit-evasion\ncontexts. Openspiel (Lanctot et al., 2019) is an established extensive collection of environments\nand algorithms for research in games. However, it mainly focuses on recreational games and does\nnot include pursuit-evasion games. Therefore, it results in a gap where the strategic, competitive,\nand cooperative elements integral to real-world applications of UNSGs need to be fully explored or\noptimized. Our GraphChase platform bridges the gap by building a flexible UNSG environment.\n6\nDISCUSSION: TESTBED FOR MULTIPLAYER GAMES\nComputing an NE in multiplayer games is generally hard (Chen & Deng, 2005; Zhang et al., 2023b),\nand designing efficient algorithms for computing such an NE is still an open challenge. Our platform\ncould be a testbed for algorithms for solving multiplayer games. In particular, our platform provides\nreal-world scenarios for adversarial team games (von Stengel & Koller, 1997; Basilico et al., 2017b;\nCelli & Gatti, 2018; Farina et al., 2018; Zhang & An, 2020a;b; Zhang et al., 2021; Farina et al.,\n2021; Zhang et al., 2022c;a;b; Zhang & Sandholm, 2022; Carminati et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023a;\nMcAleer et al., 2023; Anagnostides et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b), where a group of players competes\nagainst an adversary or another team. Various solution concepts apply depending on the situation.\nWhen team players compete independently against the adversary, the relevant solution concepts\ninclude 1) NE (Nash, 1951; Zhang et al., 2023b), where no player gains by deviating from this\nequilibrium, and 2) team-maxmin equilibrium (TME) (von Stengel & Koller, 1997; Basilico et al.,\n2017b; Celli & Gatti, 2018; Zhang & An, 2020a;b; Zhang et al., 2022c), which is a type of NE\nthat optimizes the team’s utility across all NEs. Based on our platform, if we set that pursuers\nindependently try to interdict the evader, we can also use our platform to compute an NE or TME in\nnormal-form or extensive-form games. For normal-form games where team players can coordinate\ntheir strategies, the applicable solution concept is the correlated team-maxmin equilibrium (CTME)\n(Basilico et al., 2017b). This is essentially equivalent to an NE in zero-sum two-player games, as\nthe team with coordinated strategies and a unified payoff function behaves like a single player. In\nextensive-form games, the team with coordinated strategies has two solution concepts: 1) team-\nmaxmin equilibrium with a communication device (TMECom) (Celli & Gatti, 2018), applicable\nwhen the team can continuously communicate and coordinate strategies, making the game akin to a\ntwo-player zero-sum game with perfect recall; and 2) team-maxmin equilibrium with a coordination\ndevice (TMECor) (Celli & Gatti, 2018; Zhang et al., 2021; 2024), used when the team can only\ncoordinate strategies before gameplay, rendering the game similar to a two-player zero-sum game\nwith imperfect recall. The algorithms in (Zhang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2021; Xue et al., 2021;\n2022; Li et al., 2023a; 2024) implemented on GraphChase compute a TMECom that is NE in team\nadversarial games. If we set that the team can only coordinate strategies before gameplay in the\nextensive-form games, we can also compute a TMECor on GraphChase.\n10\n7\nCONCLUSION\nWe present GraphChase, an open-source platform for UNSGs, offering researchers a flexible multi-\nplayer game environment to aid in developing scalable algorithms. Specifically, we first develop a\nunified and flexible UNSG environment and then implement several deep learning-based algorithms\nas benchmarks. Finally, we evaluate GraphChase and the results will provide insights into these\nalgorithms and further refine instruction for them. We hope our GraphChase platform can facilitate\nthe establishment of a standardized criterion for evaluating and improving algorithms for UNSGs,\nthereby contributing to the advancement of theoretical research and practical applications for solving\ngeneral multiplayer games.\nLimitation. Although we have implemented some state-of-the-art algorithms for solving UNSGs,\nthese algorithms still face significant challenges on performance and scalability. As the size and\ncomplexity of the UNSG increase, computing the best response strategy for each player becomes in-\ncreasingly time-consuming and computationally expensive. Existing algorithms struggle to scale up\nas they typically require multiple computations of the best response strategy, which can be resource-\nintensive. Our GraphChase platform has been designed to facilitate to address these challenges by\nproviding a large-scale game environment. However, despite its advanced capabilities, our plat-\nform still has some limitations that we aim to address in future works. First, the abstract nature of\ngraph-based models may not accurately capture all the dynamic and unpredictable elements of real-\nworld environments, such as variable traffic patterns and spontaneous human behaviors. Second,\nGraphChase may struggle to adapt to rapid changes in urban settings, such as emergencies or unex-\npected social events, which can alter game dynamics and require immediate strategic adjustments.\n11\nREFERENCES\nJoshua Albrecht, Abraham Fetterman, Bryden Fogelman, Ellie Kitanidis, Bartosz Wr´oblewski,\nNicole Seo, Michael Rosenthal, Maksis Knutins, Zack Polizzi, James Simon, et al.\nAvalon:\nA benchmark for rl generalization using procedurally generated worlds.

In our platform, users can configure a\nrange of parameters depending on the type of graph utilized: Grid Graph or Custom Graph.\nFor the Grid Graph, the underlying graph structure can be controlled through parameters such\nas column and row, which define the grid’s dimensions, as well as side exist prob and\ndiagonal exist prob, which determine the probabilities of edges existing between adjacent\nnodes and diagonal nodes, respectively. For the Custom Graph, the underlying structure is specified\nvia an adjacency matrix, allowing users to define a completely customized graph topology.\nIn both graph types, users can also control parameters related to the agent number and positions,\nincluding max time horizon, which defines the maximum simulation duration; pursuer num\nand evader num, specifying the number of pursuer and evader agents; and exit num, which\nsets the number of exits in the graph.\nAdditionally, initial positions for agents and exits can\nbe customized through pursuer initial position, evader initial position, and\nexit position, enabling users to tailor the simulation to specific scenarios.\nD\nEXPERIMENTS ON OTHER SETTINGS\nWe conducted experiments on a 15 × 15 grid graph to evaluate the performance of our platform in\ncomparison to existing environments. While CFR-MIX (Li et al., 2021), NSG-NFSP (Xue et al.,\n2021), and NSGZero (Xue et al., 2022) utilize the 15×15 grid graph, we found that specific settings,\nincluding the positions of pursuers, the evader, and exits, were not clearly given in their works. To\nensure a fair evaluation, we adopted uniform settings for training policies across both the original\ncode and GraphChase. There are four pursuers and ten exits for an evader. The max time horizon is\n15. The same settings allow for a direct comparison of the effectiveness of our platform against the\noriginal paper.\n17\nWe also extracted two real-world maps of Singapore with 372 nodes and Manhattan with 620 nodes\nand developed two large-scale UNSGs based on these maps. Experiments conducted on the Sin-\ngapore map have been previously tested in NSG-NFSP (Xue et al., 2021), NSGZero (Xue et al.,\n2022), Pretrained PSRO (Li et al., 2023a), and Grasper (Li et al., 2024). Manhattan map was tested\nin NSG-NFSP (Xue et al., 2021), and NSGZero (Xue et al., 2022). However, specific settings for\nthese two maps were not detailed in prior studies. For our simulations, we designated four pursuers\nand ten exits for the evader, with a time horizon set to 15 on the Singapore map.

This change results in faster simulation processes and eliminates\nredundant data copying operations, leading to improved efficiency.\nAdditionally, we have implemented various code optimizations to enhance the platform’s perfor-\nmance. These include improved data type conversions, such as using numpy-to-tensor conversions\ninstead of list-to-tensor operations, which reduces processing time. We have also focused on enhanc-\ning memory management throughout the platform, resulting in more efficient resource utilization.\nFrom the perspective of wall-clock time, this indeed accelerates the convergence speed. However,\nit’s crucial to note that in terms of the number of training iterations required for convergence, there\nis no significant improvement. For instance, if the original code necessitates sampling 104 episodes\nto initiate convergence, our platform’s reproduced algorithms similarly require approximately the\nsame number of training iterations. This consistency in training iterations is attributable to the fact\nthat we have not altered the underlying algorithms themselves.\nUnlike the original implementation, our platform is designed with modular components, making\nit unsuitable to directly compare the performance of individual components against the original\ncode. However, to emphasize the efficiency of our platform in simulation processes, we conducted\nexperiments to evaluate the time required for a single episode of simulation and the subsequent\ndata-saving process for each algorithm.

These AI systems, capable of en-\ngaging in conversations, offering guidance, and tackling complex\ndecisions, are becoming increasingly indispensable in scenarios\nrequiring nuanced, human-like judgment [1–5, 8]. Understanding\nthe behavioral patterns and decision-making strategies of AI chat-\nbots is therefore critical. Such insights not only help optimize their\nperformance in specific applications but also enable better assess-\nment of their reliability and predictability, particularly in contexts\ninvolving significant responsibilities.\nOne recent study conducted by Mei et al. [7], has primarily\nfocused on the behavior of OpenAI ChatGPT variations through\na Turing test involving classic behavioral economics games. This\nstudy has revealed intricate details about ChatGPT’s behavioral\npatterns and preferences in scenarios designed to test trust, fairness,\nrisk aversion, altruism, cooperation, and other traits. However, it\nremains unclear whether these findings are unique to ChatGPT\n∗These authors contributed equally to this research.\nor if they extend to other LLMs like Meta Llama, Google Gemini,\nAnthropic Claude, and Mistral models. These models, while being\ninfluential in the AI sphere, have not been extensively studied in\nsimilar contexts. Moreover, although some research has explored\nparticular traits (e.g., trust dynamics) among different AI models\n[10], analyses covering other behavioral dimensions are still lacking,\nraising questions about the generalizability of these behavioral\ntraits across various scenarios and models.\nAs a supplementary work of Mei et al. [7], this paper conducts\na comprehensive analysis of five prominent LLM-based AI chat-\nbot families through a series of behavioral economics games. By\nsystematically evaluating their behaviors across these games, we\naim to provide a detailed profile of these AI systems. Our study\nnot only advances the understanding of AI behaviors but also high-\nlights the nuanced differences that distinguish these models in\ndecision-making contexts. Some main findings are:\n• All tested chatbots successfully capture specific human behav-\nior modes, leading to highly concentrated decision distributions\n(Fig. 1).\n• Although flagship chatbots demonstrate a notable probability of\npassing the Turing test (Fig. 2), AI chatbots can merely produce\na behavior distribution similar to humans (Fig. 3).\n• Compared to humans, AI chatbots place greater emphasis on\nmaximizing fairness in their payoff preferences (Fig. 4).\n• AI chatbots may exhibit inconsistencies in their payoff prefer-\nences across different games (Table 2).\n• Different AI chatbots exhibit distinct behavioral patterns in\ngames (Fig. 1), which can be further distinguished through\nTuring test results (Fig. 2), revealed payoff preferences (Fig.\n4), and behavioral inconsistencies (Table 2). These findings\nhighlight the effectiveness of our behavioral benchmark in\nprofiling and differentiating AI chatbots.\narXiv:2412.12362v1  [cs.AI]  16 Dec 2024\nXie et al.\nCooperate\n100.00%\nCooperate\n100.00%\nCooperate\n60.00%\nCooperate\n100.00%\nCooperate\n94.00%\nCooperate\n45.12%\nDefect\n0.00%\nDefect\n0.00%\nDefect\n40.00%\nDefect\n0.00%\nDefect\n6.00%\nDefect\n54.88%\nHuman\nOpenAI GPT 4o\nMeta Llama 3.1 405B\nGoogle Gemini 1.5 Pro\nAnthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet\nMistral Large 2\n(a) Dictator\n(b) Ultimatum - Proposer\n(c) Ultimatum - Responder\n(d) Trust - Investor\n(e) Trust - Banker\n(f) Public Goods\n(g) Bomb\n(h) Prisoner’s Dilemma\nFigure 1: Distributions of AI chatbot behaviors in economics games.\n2\nMethods\n2.1\nLLM-Based AI Chatbots\nThis study focuses on five families of LLM-based AI chatbots, as\ndetailed in Table 1.

[7], we employ six classic behavioral economics\ngames to evaluate multiple dimensions of AI behavior, including\naltruism, fairness, trust, risk aversion, and cooperation. These games\ninclude Dictator, Ultimatum, Trust, Public Goods, Bomb Risk, and\nPrisoner’s Dilemma. Detailed descriptions of the games and the\nassociated prompts can be found in Mei et al. [7].\nFor each game and AI chatbot, we generate multiple responses\nusing the respective game prompts, collecting 50 independent valid\nresponses to establish the behavior distribution of each model.\nHuman behavior distributions are taken from Mei et al. [7] for\ncomparison.\n3\nResults\n3.1\nBehaviors of AI Chatbots\nFigure 1 (and Figure 8 in the Appendix) illustrates the distributions\nof AI choices across the six games. Overall, the distributions of\nAI chatbots are notably more concentrated compared to human\ndistributions, capturing only specific modes of human behavior.\nAdditionally, different AI chatbots exhibit distinctly varied behav-\nioral patterns, reflecting their unique orientations across multiple\nbehavioral dimensions.\nAltruism. In games including Dictator (Fig. 1a) and Ultimatum\n- Proposer that reveal the altruism of players, AI chatbots display\nto be more altruistic than humans by offering more to the partner.\nSurprisingly, a large fraction of Google Gemini 1.5 Pro instances\nchoose to offer most of the money ($90-$99) in Ultimatum - Proposer,\nshowing its particularly high tendency of altruism.\nFairness. Fairness is often emphasized by AI chatbots across\ngames. In the Dictator (Fig. 1a) and Ultimatum - Proposer Game (Fig.\n1b), most AI chatbots choose to offer $50 to the partner, meaning\na fair split. Correspondingly, Meta Llama 3.1 405B fairly requires\na minimum split of $50 as the Responder in Ultimatum (Fig. 1c).\nSimilarly in the Trust - Banker Game (Fig. 1e), OpenAI GPT 4o and\nAnthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet tend to return the investment and half\nthe profit ($100 in total) to the investor.\nTrust. The Trust Game (Fig. 1d) particularly shows the trust\ndynamics. As the investor in the Trust investment game, AI chatbots\npossess different levels of trust towards the banker – Anthropic\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet and Google Gemini 1.5 Pro display a higher trust\nlevel, investing $53.20 and $51.20 on average; While other models\nmostly invest $50 to the banker.\nHow Different AI Chatbots Behave?

The Bomb Risk Game (Fig. 1) tests the risk pref-\nerence of players. In this game, Meta Llama 3.1 405B and Mistral\nLarge 2 are risk-neural and choose to open 50 boxes most of the\ntime, which yields the maximized expected payoff. However, com-\npared to these two models, OpenAI GPT 4o and Google Gemini 1.5\nPro are more risk-averse, opening 14.06 and 35.46 boxes on aver-\nage. Interestingly, Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet displays different\nrisk preferences across instances – 44% instances open less than 50\nboxes, while 46% instances open more than 50 boxes.\nCooperation. In the Prisoner’s Dilemma Game (Fig. 1h), which\nshows the cooperation tendency of models, Meta Llama 3.1 405B,\nAnthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Mistral Large 2 have the high-\nest proportion of choosing the Cooperation action (100%). Google\nGemini 1.5 Pro has the lowest rate of cooperating (60.00%), but the\nratio is still significantly larger than humans (45.12%). However, in\nthe Public Goods Game (Fig. 1f), most models tend to contribute\nhalf the money ($10) to the group instead of a larger contribution.\n3.2\nThe Behavioral Turing Test\nUsing the collected behavior distributions of AI chatbots and the\nexcerpted human behaviors, we conduct Turing tests following\nthe methodology outlined in Mei et al. [7]. Adopting the same\nprocedure as described in the paper, each round of the test involves\nindependently sampling one human action and one action from the\nAI behavior distribution. These samples are then compared based\non their probabilities within the human distribution.\nFigure 2 presents the results of the Turing tests. Overall, all tested\nAI chatbots demonstrate a remarkable ability to pass the Turing\ntest, with Meta Llama 3.1 405B achieving the highest winning rate\nagainst humans at 46.4%.\nHowever, in certain games, the chatbots exhibit significant chal-\nlenges in replicating human behavior. For instance, in the Trust\nGame - Investor role (Fig. 2e), AI chatbots tend to invest conserva-\ntively, whereas a substantial fraction of human players opt to invest\ntheir entire amount (Fig. 1d). Similarly, in the Prisoner’s Dilemma\nXie et al.\n(Fig. 2i), AI chatbots show a pronounced inclination toward coop-\neration, while over half of the human players choose to defect (Fig.\n1h).\nAI chatbots exhibit diverse capabilities in passing the Turing\ntest across different games. OpenAI GPT-4 shows a relatively high\nsuccess rate in the Ultimatum - Proposer, Trust - Banker, and Public\nGoods games but struggles significantly in the Bomb Risk Game.\nSimilarly, Meta Llama 3.1 405B performs well in many games but\nfalls short in the Trust - Banker scenario. Anthropic Claude 3.5\nSonnet stands out in the Trust - Banker Game but barely passes the\nTuring test in the Ultimatum - Responder role.\n3.3\nBehavior Distribution Similarity\nWhile the Turing test is a valuable method for evaluating an AI’s\nability to act like a single human player [9], it has inherent limita-\ntions in capturing the complete spectrum of the behavior distribu-\ntion. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a complementary\napproach: a distribution similarity test that assesses whether AI\nchatbots can accurately represent the behavior distribution of a\nhuman population.\nTable 3 (and Table 5 in the Appendix) presents the pairwise dis-\nsimilarities of behavior distributions, measured using the Wasser-\nstein distance. Smaller distances indicate greater similarity between\ntwo distributions, whether comparing chatbots or humans and chat-\nbots.\nAmong the AI chatbots, gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 demonstrates the\nhighest similarity to the human population (Fig. 5), likely due to\nits ability to produce relatively diverse choices (Fig. 8). However,\ndespite this similarity, a significant gap remains between the human\nbehavior distribution and AI-generated actions, with no chatbot\nachieving a distribution that closely mirrors human behaviors.\nWe also observe relatively small Wasserstein distances among\nMeta Llama 3.1, Anthropic Claude models, and Mistral Large models\n(Fig. 5), indicating that these chatbots exhibit similar behavioral\npatterns.\n3.4\nRevealing the payoff Preferences\nTo uncover the intrinsic objectives underlying the behaviors of AI\nchatbots, we perform analyses to identify and characterize their\npayoff preferences.\nObjective optimization efficiency. The objective function of AI\nchatbots is quantitatively estimated by assessing the degree to\nwhich their behaviors align with the optimization goals. We adopt\nthe family of utility functions from Mei et al. [7]:\n𝑈𝑏=\n\u0002\n𝑏× Own payoff 𝑟+ (1 −𝑏) × Partner payoff 𝑟\u00031\/𝑟,\n(1)\nwhere 𝑏∈[0, 1] represents the trade-off between a player’s own\npayoff and their partner’s payoff. Specifically, 𝑏= 1 corresponds\nto purely selfish preferences, 𝑏= 0 represents purely selfless pref-\nerences, and 𝑏= 0.5 reflects a preference for maximizing the com-\nbined payoff of both players. In this context, 𝑟is a specification\nparameter that is frequently set to 1 (indicating a linear specifica-\ntion) or 1\/2 (corresponding to a constant elasticity of substitution\nutility function, CES specification), as commonly adopted in the\nliterature [6].\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nb\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\nOptimization squared error\n0.34\n0.28\n0.22\n0.15\n0.09\n0.05\n0.04\n0.06\n0.09\n0.13\n0.17\n0.20\n0.17\n0.13\n0.09\n0.06\n0.03\n0.04\n0.07\n0.11\n0.15\n0.20\n0.24\n0.21\n0.17\n0.13\n0.09\n0.06\n0.06\n0.08\n0.12\n0.16\n0.19\n0.23\n0.19\n0.15\n0.11\n0.08\n0.05\n0.05\n0.08\n0.13\n0.19\n0.26\n0.22\n0.19\n0.15\n0.11\n0.07\n0.04\n0.04\n0.07\n0.11\n0.16\n0.21\n0.19\n0.16\n0.12\n0.09\n0.05\n0.02\n0.03\n0.06\n0.10\n0.14\n0.18\nHuman\nOpenAI GPT 4o\nMeta Llama 3.1 405B\nGoogle Gemini 1.5 Pro\nAnthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet\nMistral Large 2\n(a) Linear specification (𝑟= 1).\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nb\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\nOptimization squared error\n0.34\n0.28\n0.21\n0.15\n0.10\n0.06\n0.05\n0.07\n0.09\n0.13\n0.17\n0.20\n0.14\n0.09\n0.05\n0.03\n0.03\n0.03\n0.06\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.24\n0.18\n0.12\n0.08\n0.06\n0.06\n0.05\n0.07\n0.11\n0.15\n0.19\n0.23\n0.18\n0.13\n0.09\n0.07\n0.06\n0.08\n0.11\n0.16\n0.21\n0.26\n0.22\n0.16\n0.11\n0.07\n0.05\n0.04\n0.04\n0.06\n0.10\n0.15\n0.21\n0.19\n0.13\n0.08\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n0.02\n0.05\n0.09\n0.13\n0.18\nHuman\nOpenAI GPT 4o\nMeta Llama 3.1 405B\nGoogle Gemini 1.5 Pro\nAnthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet\nMistral Large 2\n(b) Non-linear (CES) specification (𝑟= 1\/2).\nFigure 4: The mean squared error (MSE) of the actual play dis-\ntribution relative to the best-response utility, when matched\nwith a partner playing the human distribution. The errors\nare calculated for each possible preference 𝑏in the objective\nfunction (Eq. 1), and the average across all games is plotted.\nParticularly, 𝑏= 1 corresponds to purely selfish preferences,\n𝑏= 0 represents purely selfless preferences, and 𝑏= 0.5 re-\nflects a preference for maximizing the combined payoff of\nboth players. 𝑟is a specification parameter set as 𝑟= 1 and\n𝑟= 1\/2.\nFigure 4 displays the optimization errors for various values of\n𝑏for human players and each AI chatbot, computed under the as-\nsumption that the AI chatbots are interacting with a random human\nplayer. A lower optimization error indicates greater optimization\nefficiency, suggesting that the model is more likely to be optimizing\nfor that particular objective.\nThe figure reveals that, in both utility specifications (𝑟= 1 and\n𝑟= 1\/2), AI chatbots place a stronger emphasis on fairness, as\nindicated by the lowest optimization error consistently occurring\nHow Different AI Chatbots Behave? Benchmarking Large Language Models in Behavioral Economics Games\nat 𝑏= 0.5. In contrast, human players exhibit a slight preference for\nselfishness, with their lowest optimization error occurring at𝑏= 0.6.\nAdditionally, AI chatbots demonstrate significantly higher optimiza-\ntion efficiency than humans when maximizing the partner’s payoff\n(𝑏= 0), but they exhibit lower efficiencies when optimizing their\nown payoff (𝑏= 1).\nDifferent AI models exhibit varying levels of optimization ef-\nficiency. For example, when optimizing for the partner’s payoff\n(𝑏= 0) or the combined payoff ( b=0.5 ), Mistral Large 2 achieves\nthe highest optimization efficiency, followed by OpenAI GPT-4o.\nIn contrast, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro and Meta Llama 3.1 405B show\nrelatively lower optimization efficiency in these scenarios. When\noptimizing for their own payoff (𝑏= 1), all chatbots perform with\nhigher errors compared to humans, with Google Gemini 1.5 Pro\ndisplaying an even greater error than the other models.\nDetailed optimization error plots for each individual game are\nprovided in Figures 6–7 in the Appendix.\nLogistic multinomial model fitting. In addition to the optimiza-\ntion efficiency analysis, a logistic multinomial model is also fitted\nto predict the behavior of AI chatbots. Following Mei et al. [7] , we\nassume AI takes action 𝑘with a probability\nPr(𝑘) =\nexp(𝑈𝑏(𝑘))\nÍ\n𝑗≤𝐾exp(𝑈𝑏(𝑗)) ,\n(2)\nwhere 𝐾is the number of all possible action choices.\nTable 3 summarizes the estimated 𝑏values based on the assumed\nlogistic multinomial model. The table reveals that in nearly all\ngames (except for the Ultimatum Game), the majority of AI chatbots\nexhibit estimated 𝑏values significantly lower than those of random\nhuman players. This indicates that, on average, AI chatbots tend to\nbe more selfless compared to human players.\n3.5\nBehavior Inconsistency\nPlayer\nInconsistency\n𝑟= 1.0\n𝑟= 0.5\nHuman players\n0.114\n0.122\nOpenAI GPT 4o\n0.115\n0.107\nMeta Llama 3.1 405B\n0.125\n0.125\nGoogle Gemini 1.5 Pro\n0.118\n0.139\nAnthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n0.143\n0.133\nMistral Large 2\n0.108\n0.100\nTable 2: Behavior inconsistency across games of AI chatbots.\nThe inconsistency is estimated by the mean absolute error\nof payoff curves (Fig. 6-7 in the Appendix).\nAlthough AI chatbots generally emphasize fairness and exhibit\nmore selfless tendencies, they can display inconsistent behavior\nacross different scenarios. For instance, a significant portion of\nGoogle Gemini 1.5 Pro instances choose to split the money fairly\nin the Dictator Game, yet in the Ultimatum - Proposer role, many\ninstances propose offering nearly all the money ($90-$99) to the\npartner, reflecting an altruistic trait.\nTable 2 (and Table 4 in the Appendix) provides the estimated\nbehavior inconsistencies of AI chatbots. These inconsistencies are\nmeasured using the mean absolute error (MAE) of payoff curves\nacross different games (see Figures 6–7 in the Appendix).\nAmong the flagship AI chatbots, Mistral Large 2 demonstrates\nthe highest consistency across all games, as its own payoff and\nthe partner’s payoff are well-balanced in most scenarios (Fig. 1).\nIn contrast, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro and Anthropic Claude 3.5 Son-\nnet exhibit higher levels of inconsistency, even surpassing that of\nhuman players – despite the fact that human behaviors reflect the\ndiversity of a heterogeneous population.\n4\nDiscussion\nModel checkpoints. As AI chatbots evolve, their behavioral ten-\ndencies shift over time. Figures 8(i,ii) illustrate these changes across\ncheckpoints for OpenAI GPT-4 and GPT-3 models. For GPT-4, ex-\ncept for the Bomb Risk Game, the latest checkpoint (gpt-4-0125-preview)\nproduces more concentrated behavior distributions compared to\nolder checkpoints. The updated version also demonstrates higher\nrationality in the Ultimatum - Responder Game but shows increased\nrisk aversion in the Bomb Risk Game. For GPT-3, while the distribu-\ntion modes largely remain consistent, the behavior distributions for\nthe Ultimatum - Responder, Trust - Banker, and Bomb Risk games\nhave become less diverse over successive updates.\nModel size. In addition to different checkpoints, variations in\nmodel size can also influence behavior. As shown in Figures 8(iii,iv),\nMeta Llama 3 8B behaves notably differently from the 70B version.\nIn games like Ultimatum - Proposer, Trust - Investor, Public Goods,\nand Prisoner’s Dilemma, the 8B model exhibits more conservative\ntendencies. For both Llama 3 and Anthropic Claude 3, smaller mod-\nels (e.g., Llama 3 8B, Claude 3 Sonnet, and Claude 3 Haiku) display\nhigher diversity in their behavior distributions compared to their\nlarger counterparts.\n5\nConclusion and Future Work\nThis study benchmarked LLM-based AI chatbots across a series of\nbehavioral economics games. The analyses revealed the following\ncommon and distinct behavioral patterns of the chatbots: (1) All\ntested chatbots successfully capture specific human behavior modes,\nleading to highly concentrated decision distributions; (2) Although\nflagship chatbots demonstrate a notable probability of passing the\nTuring test, AI chatbots can merely produce a behavior distribution\nsimilar to humans; (3) Compared to humans, AI chatbots place\ngreater emphasis on maximizing fairness in their payoff prefer-\nences; (4) AI chatbots may exhibit inconsistencies in their payoff\npreferences across different games; (5) Different AI chatbots exhibit\ndistinct behavioral patterns in games, which can be further distin-\nguished in our analyses. These findings highlight the effectiveness\nof our behavioral benchmark in profiling and differentiating AI\nchatbots.\nWe hope our research contributes to a deeper understanding of\nAI behaviors and serves as a foundation for future studies in AI\nbehavioral science. For example, the discrepancies between Turing\ntest results and distribution dissimilarities highlight the need for\nfurther alignment objectives that enable LLMs to better represent\nthe diversity of the human behaviors. Additionally, the observed\ninconsistencies in AI behaviors across games underscore the im-\nportance of developing generalizable preferences and objectives for\nAI systems that can adapt effectively across various scenarios.\nXie et al.","pdf_path":"tools\/arxiv_tools\/asset\/pdf\/\/How Different AI Chatbots Behave?

These AI systems, capable of en-\ngaging in conversations, offering guidance, and tackling complex\ndecisions, are becoming increasingly indispensable in scenarios\nrequiring nuanced, human-like judgment [1–5, 8]. Understanding\nthe behavioral patterns and decision-making strategies of AI chat-\nbots is therefore critical. Such insights not only help optimize their\nperformance in specific applications but also enable better assess-\nment of their reliability and predictability, particularly in contexts\ninvolving significant responsibilities.\nOne recent study conducted by Mei et al. [7], has primarily\nfocused on the behavior of OpenAI ChatGPT variations through\na Turing test involving classic behavioral economics games. This\nstudy has revealed intricate details about ChatGPT’s behavioral\npatterns and preferences in scenarios designed to test trust, fairness,\nrisk aversion, altruism, cooperation, and other traits. However, it\nremains unclear whether these findings are unique to ChatGPT\n∗These authors contributed equally to this research.\nor if they extend to other LLMs like Meta Llama, Google Gemini,\nAnthropic Claude, and Mistral models. These models, while being\ninfluential in the AI sphere, have not been extensively studied in\nsimilar contexts. Moreover, although some research has explored\nparticular traits (e.g., trust dynamics) among different AI models\n[10], analyses covering other behavioral dimensions are still lacking,\nraising questions about the generalizability of these behavioral\ntraits across various scenarios and models.\nAs a supplementary work of Mei et al. [7], this paper conducts\na comprehensive analysis of five prominent LLM-based AI chat-\nbot families through a series of behavioral economics games. By\nsystematically evaluating their behaviors across these games, we\naim to provide a detailed profile of these AI systems. Our study\nnot only advances the understanding of AI behaviors but also high-\nlights the nuanced differences that distinguish these models in\ndecision-making contexts. Some main findings are:\n• All tested chatbots successfully capture specific human behav-\nior modes, leading to highly concentrated decision distributions\n(Fig. 1).\n• Although flagship chatbots demonstrate a notable probability of\npassing the Turing test (Fig. 2), AI chatbots can merely produce\na behavior distribution similar to humans (Fig. 3).\n• Compared to humans, AI chatbots place greater emphasis on\nmaximizing fairness in their payoff preferences (Fig. 4).\n• AI chatbots may exhibit inconsistencies in their payoff prefer-\nences across different games (Table 2).\n• Different AI chatbots exhibit distinct behavioral patterns in\ngames (Fig. 1), which can be further distinguished through\nTuring test results (Fig. 2), revealed payoff preferences (Fig.\n4), and behavioral inconsistencies (Table 2). These findings\nhighlight the effectiveness of our behavioral benchmark in\nprofiling and differentiating AI chatbots.\narXiv:2412.12362v1  [cs.AI]  16 Dec 2024\nXie et al.\nCooperate\n100.00%\nCooperate\n100.00%\nCooperate\n60.00%\nCooperate\n100.00%\nCooperate\n94.00%\nCooperate\n45.12%\nDefect\n0.00%\nDefect\n0.00%\nDefect\n40.00%\nDefect\n0.00%\nDefect\n6.00%\nDefect\n54.88%\nHuman\nOpenAI GPT 4o\nMeta Llama 3.1 405B\nGoogle Gemini 1.5 Pro\nAnthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet\nMistral Large 2\n(a) Dictator\n(b) Ultimatum - Proposer\n(c) Ultimatum - Responder\n(d) Trust - Investor\n(e) Trust - Banker\n(f) Public Goods\n(g) Bomb\n(h) Prisoner’s Dilemma\nFigure 1: Distributions of AI chatbot behaviors in economics games.\n2\nMethods\n2.1\nLLM-Based AI Chatbots\nThis study focuses on five families of LLM-based AI chatbots, as\ndetailed in Table 1.

[7], we employ six classic behavioral economics\ngames to evaluate multiple dimensions of AI behavior, including\naltruism, fairness, trust, risk aversion, and cooperation. These games\ninclude Dictator, Ultimatum, Trust, Public Goods, Bomb Risk, and\nPrisoner’s Dilemma. Detailed descriptions of the games and the\nassociated prompts can be found in Mei et al. [7].\nFor each game and AI chatbot, we generate multiple responses\nusing the respective game prompts, collecting 50 independent valid\nresponses to establish the behavior distribution of each model.\nHuman behavior distributions are taken from Mei et al. [7] for\ncomparison.\n3\nResults\n3.1\nBehaviors of AI Chatbots\nFigure 1 (and Figure 8 in the Appendix) illustrates the distributions\nof AI choices across the six games. Overall, the distributions of\nAI chatbots are notably more concentrated compared to human\ndistributions, capturing only specific modes of human behavior.\nAdditionally, different AI chatbots exhibit distinctly varied behav-\nioral patterns, reflecting their unique orientations across multiple\nbehavioral dimensions.\nAltruism. In games including Dictator (Fig. 1a) and Ultimatum\n- Proposer that reveal the altruism of players, AI chatbots display\nto be more altruistic than humans by offering more to the partner.\nSurprisingly, a large fraction of Google Gemini 1.5 Pro instances\nchoose to offer most of the money ($90-$99) in Ultimatum - Proposer,\nshowing its particularly high tendency of altruism.\nFairness. Fairness is often emphasized by AI chatbots across\ngames. In the Dictator (Fig. 1a) and Ultimatum - Proposer Game (Fig.\n1b), most AI chatbots choose to offer $50 to the partner, meaning\na fair split. Correspondingly, Meta Llama 3.1 405B fairly requires\na minimum split of $50 as the Responder in Ultimatum (Fig. 1c).\nSimilarly in the Trust - Banker Game (Fig. 1e), OpenAI GPT 4o and\nAnthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet tend to return the investment and half\nthe profit ($100 in total) to the investor.\nTrust. The Trust Game (Fig. 1d) particularly shows the trust\ndynamics. As the investor in the Trust investment game, AI chatbots\npossess different levels of trust towards the banker – Anthropic\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet and Google Gemini 1.5 Pro display a higher trust\nlevel, investing $53.20 and $51.20 on average; While other models\nmostly invest $50 to the banker.\nHow Different AI Chatbots Behave?

The Bomb Risk Game (Fig. 1) tests the risk pref-\nerence of players. In this game, Meta Llama 3.1 405B and Mistral\nLarge 2 are risk-neural and choose to open 50 boxes most of the\ntime, which yields the maximized expected payoff. However, com-\npared to these two models, OpenAI GPT 4o and Google Gemini 1.5\nPro are more risk-averse, opening 14.06 and 35.46 boxes on aver-\nage. Interestingly, Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet displays different\nrisk preferences across instances – 44% instances open less than 50\nboxes, while 46% instances open more than 50 boxes.\nCooperation. In the Prisoner’s Dilemma Game (Fig. 1h), which\nshows the cooperation tendency of models, Meta Llama 3.1 405B,\nAnthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Mistral Large 2 have the high-\nest proportion of choosing the Cooperation action (100%). Google\nGemini 1.5 Pro has the lowest rate of cooperating (60.00%), but the\nratio is still significantly larger than humans (45.12%). However, in\nthe Public Goods Game (Fig. 1f), most models tend to contribute\nhalf the money ($10) to the group instead of a larger contribution.\n3.2\nThe Behavioral Turing Test\nUsing the collected behavior distributions of AI chatbots and the\nexcerpted human behaviors, we conduct Turing tests following\nthe methodology outlined in Mei et al. [7]. Adopting the same\nprocedure as described in the paper, each round of the test involves\nindependently sampling one human action and one action from the\nAI behavior distribution. These samples are then compared based\non their probabilities within the human distribution.\nFigure 2 presents the results of the Turing tests. Overall, all tested\nAI chatbots demonstrate a remarkable ability to pass the Turing\ntest, with Meta Llama 3.1 405B achieving the highest winning rate\nagainst humans at 46.4%.\nHowever, in certain games, the chatbots exhibit significant chal-\nlenges in replicating human behavior. For instance, in the Trust\nGame - Investor role (Fig. 2e), AI chatbots tend to invest conserva-\ntively, whereas a substantial fraction of human players opt to invest\ntheir entire amount (Fig. 1d). Similarly, in the Prisoner’s Dilemma\nXie et al.\n(Fig. 2i), AI chatbots show a pronounced inclination toward coop-\neration, while over half of the human players choose to defect (Fig.\n1h).\nAI chatbots exhibit diverse capabilities in passing the Turing\ntest across different games. OpenAI GPT-4 shows a relatively high\nsuccess rate in the Ultimatum - Proposer, Trust - Banker, and Public\nGoods games but struggles significantly in the Bomb Risk Game.\nSimilarly, Meta Llama 3.1 405B performs well in many games but\nfalls short in the Trust - Banker scenario. Anthropic Claude 3.5\nSonnet stands out in the Trust - Banker Game but barely passes the\nTuring test in the Ultimatum - Responder role.\n3.3\nBehavior Distribution Similarity\nWhile the Turing test is a valuable method for evaluating an AI’s\nability to act like a single human player [9], it has inherent limita-\ntions in capturing the complete spectrum of the behavior distribu-\ntion. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a complementary\napproach: a distribution similarity test that assesses whether AI\nchatbots can accurately represent the behavior distribution of a\nhuman population.\nTable 3 (and Table 5 in the Appendix) presents the pairwise dis-\nsimilarities of behavior distributions, measured using the Wasser-\nstein distance. Smaller distances indicate greater similarity between\ntwo distributions, whether comparing chatbots or humans and chat-\nbots.\nAmong the AI chatbots, gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 demonstrates the\nhighest similarity to the human population (Fig. 5), likely due to\nits ability to produce relatively diverse choices (Fig. 8). However,\ndespite this similarity, a significant gap remains between the human\nbehavior distribution and AI-generated actions, with no chatbot\nachieving a distribution that closely mirrors human behaviors.\nWe also observe relatively small Wasserstein distances among\nMeta Llama 3.1, Anthropic Claude models, and Mistral Large models\n(Fig. 5), indicating that these chatbots exhibit similar behavioral\npatterns.\n3.4\nRevealing the payoff Preferences\nTo uncover the intrinsic objectives underlying the behaviors of AI\nchatbots, we perform analyses to identify and characterize their\npayoff preferences.\nObjective optimization efficiency. The objective function of AI\nchatbots is quantitatively estimated by assessing the degree to\nwhich their behaviors align with the optimization goals. We adopt\nthe family of utility functions from Mei et al. [7]:\n𝑈𝑏=\n\u0002\n𝑏× Own payoff 𝑟+ (1 −𝑏) × Partner payoff 𝑟\u00031\/𝑟,\n(1)\nwhere 𝑏∈[0, 1] represents the trade-off between a player’s own\npayoff and their partner’s payoff. Specifically, 𝑏= 1 corresponds\nto purely selfish preferences, 𝑏= 0 represents purely selfless pref-\nerences, and 𝑏= 0.5 reflects a preference for maximizing the com-\nbined payoff of both players. In this context, 𝑟is a specification\nparameter that is frequently set to 1 (indicating a linear specifica-\ntion) or 1\/2 (corresponding to a constant elasticity of substitution\nutility function, CES specification), as commonly adopted in the\nliterature [6].\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nb\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\nOptimization squared error\n0.34\n0.28\n0.22\n0.15\n0.09\n0.05\n0.04\n0.06\n0.09\n0.13\n0.17\n0.20\n0.17\n0.13\n0.09\n0.06\n0.03\n0.04\n0.07\n0.11\n0.15\n0.20\n0.24\n0.21\n0.17\n0.13\n0.09\n0.06\n0.06\n0.08\n0.12\n0.16\n0.19\n0.23\n0.19\n0.15\n0.11\n0.08\n0.05\n0.05\n0.08\n0.13\n0.19\n0.26\n0.22\n0.19\n0.15\n0.11\n0.07\n0.04\n0.04\n0.07\n0.11\n0.16\n0.21\n0.19\n0.16\n0.12\n0.09\n0.05\n0.02\n0.03\n0.06\n0.10\n0.14\n0.18\nHuman\nOpenAI GPT 4o\nMeta Llama 3.1 405B\nGoogle Gemini 1.5 Pro\nAnthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet\nMistral Large 2\n(a) Linear specification (𝑟= 1).\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nb\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\nOptimization squared error\n0.34\n0.28\n0.21\n0.15\n0.10\n0.06\n0.05\n0.07\n0.09\n0.13\n0.17\n0.20\n0.14\n0.09\n0.05\n0.03\n0.03\n0.03\n0.06\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.24\n0.18\n0.12\n0.08\n0.06\n0.06\n0.05\n0.07\n0.11\n0.15\n0.19\n0.23\n0.18\n0.13\n0.09\n0.07\n0.06\n0.08\n0.11\n0.16\n0.21\n0.26\n0.22\n0.16\n0.11\n0.07\n0.05\n0.04\n0.04\n0.06\n0.10\n0.15\n0.21\n0.19\n0.13\n0.08\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n0.02\n0.05\n0.09\n0.13\n0.18\nHuman\nOpenAI GPT 4o\nMeta Llama 3.1 405B\nGoogle Gemini 1.5 Pro\nAnthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet\nMistral Large 2\n(b) Non-linear (CES) specification (𝑟= 1\/2).\nFigure 4: The mean squared error (MSE) of the actual play dis-\ntribution relative to the best-response utility, when matched\nwith a partner playing the human distribution. The errors\nare calculated for each possible preference 𝑏in the objective\nfunction (Eq. 1), and the average across all games is plotted.\nParticularly, 𝑏= 1 corresponds to purely selfish preferences,\n𝑏= 0 represents purely selfless preferences, and 𝑏= 0.5 re-\nflects a preference for maximizing the combined payoff of\nboth players. 𝑟is a specification parameter set as 𝑟= 1 and\n𝑟= 1\/2.\nFigure 4 displays the optimization errors for various values of\n𝑏for human players and each AI chatbot, computed under the as-\nsumption that the AI chatbots are interacting with a random human\nplayer. A lower optimization error indicates greater optimization\nefficiency, suggesting that the model is more likely to be optimizing\nfor that particular objective.\nThe figure reveals that, in both utility specifications (𝑟= 1 and\n𝑟= 1\/2), AI chatbots place a stronger emphasis on fairness, as\nindicated by the lowest optimization error consistently occurring\nHow Different AI Chatbots Behave? Benchmarking Large Language Models in Behavioral Economics Games\nat 𝑏= 0.5. In contrast, human players exhibit a slight preference for\nselfishness, with their lowest optimization error occurring at𝑏= 0.6.\nAdditionally, AI chatbots demonstrate significantly higher optimiza-\ntion efficiency than humans when maximizing the partner’s payoff\n(𝑏= 0), but they exhibit lower efficiencies when optimizing their\nown payoff (𝑏= 1).\nDifferent AI models exhibit varying levels of optimization ef-\nficiency. For example, when optimizing for the partner’s payoff\n(𝑏= 0) or the combined payoff ( b=0.5 ), Mistral Large 2 achieves\nthe highest optimization efficiency, followed by OpenAI GPT-4o.\nIn contrast, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro and Meta Llama 3.1 405B show\nrelatively lower optimization efficiency in these scenarios. When\noptimizing for their own payoff (𝑏= 1), all chatbots perform with\nhigher errors compared to humans, with Google Gemini 1.5 Pro\ndisplaying an even greater error than the other models.\nDetailed optimization error plots for each individual game are\nprovided in Figures 6–7 in the Appendix.\nLogistic multinomial model fitting. In addition to the optimiza-\ntion efficiency analysis, a logistic multinomial model is also fitted\nto predict the behavior of AI chatbots. Following Mei et al. [7] , we\nassume AI takes action 𝑘with a probability\nPr(𝑘) =\nexp(𝑈𝑏(𝑘))\nÍ\n𝑗≤𝐾exp(𝑈𝑏(𝑗)) ,\n(2)\nwhere 𝐾is the number of all possible action choices.\nTable 3 summarizes the estimated 𝑏values based on the assumed\nlogistic multinomial model. The table reveals that in nearly all\ngames (except for the Ultimatum Game), the majority of AI chatbots\nexhibit estimated 𝑏values significantly lower than those of random\nhuman players. This indicates that, on average, AI chatbots tend to\nbe more selfless compared to human players.\n3.5\nBehavior Inconsistency\nPlayer\nInconsistency\n𝑟= 1.0\n𝑟= 0.5\nHuman players\n0.114\n0.122\nOpenAI GPT 4o\n0.115\n0.107\nMeta Llama 3.1 405B\n0.125\n0.125\nGoogle Gemini 1.5 Pro\n0.118\n0.139\nAnthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n0.143\n0.133\nMistral Large 2\n0.108\n0.100\nTable 2: Behavior inconsistency across games of AI chatbots.\nThe inconsistency is estimated by the mean absolute error\nof payoff curves (Fig. 6-7 in the Appendix).\nAlthough AI chatbots generally emphasize fairness and exhibit\nmore selfless tendencies, they can display inconsistent behavior\nacross different scenarios. For instance, a significant portion of\nGoogle Gemini 1.5 Pro instances choose to split the money fairly\nin the Dictator Game, yet in the Ultimatum - Proposer role, many\ninstances propose offering nearly all the money ($90-$99) to the\npartner, reflecting an altruistic trait.\nTable 2 (and Table 4 in the Appendix) provides the estimated\nbehavior inconsistencies of AI chatbots. These inconsistencies are\nmeasured using the mean absolute error (MAE) of payoff curves\nacross different games (see Figures 6–7 in the Appendix).\nAmong the flagship AI chatbots, Mistral Large 2 demonstrates\nthe highest consistency across all games, as its own payoff and\nthe partner’s payoff are well-balanced in most scenarios (Fig. 1).\nIn contrast, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro and Anthropic Claude 3.5 Son-\nnet exhibit higher levels of inconsistency, even surpassing that of\nhuman players – despite the fact that human behaviors reflect the\ndiversity of a heterogeneous population.\n4\nDiscussion\nModel checkpoints. As AI chatbots evolve, their behavioral ten-\ndencies shift over time. Figures 8(i,ii) illustrate these changes across\ncheckpoints for OpenAI GPT-4 and GPT-3 models. For GPT-4, ex-\ncept for the Bomb Risk Game, the latest checkpoint (gpt-4-0125-preview)\nproduces more concentrated behavior distributions compared to\nolder checkpoints. The updated version also demonstrates higher\nrationality in the Ultimatum - Responder Game but shows increased\nrisk aversion in the Bomb Risk Game. For GPT-3, while the distribu-\ntion modes largely remain consistent, the behavior distributions for\nthe Ultimatum - Responder, Trust - Banker, and Bomb Risk games\nhave become less diverse over successive updates.\nModel size. In addition to different checkpoints, variations in\nmodel size can also influence behavior. As shown in Figures 8(iii,iv),\nMeta Llama 3 8B behaves notably differently from the 70B version.\nIn games like Ultimatum - Proposer, Trust - Investor, Public Goods,\nand Prisoner’s Dilemma, the 8B model exhibits more conservative\ntendencies. For both Llama 3 and Anthropic Claude 3, smaller mod-\nels (e.g., Llama 3 8B, Claude 3 Sonnet, and Claude 3 Haiku) display\nhigher diversity in their behavior distributions compared to their\nlarger counterparts.\n5\nConclusion and Future Work\nThis study benchmarked LLM-based AI chatbots across a series of\nbehavioral economics games. The analyses revealed the following\ncommon and distinct behavioral patterns of the chatbots: (1) All\ntested chatbots successfully capture specific human behavior modes,\nleading to highly concentrated decision distributions; (2) Although\nflagship chatbots demonstrate a notable probability of passing the\nTuring test, AI chatbots can merely produce a behavior distribution\nsimilar to humans; (3) Compared to humans, AI chatbots place\ngreater emphasis on maximizing fairness in their payoff prefer-\nences; (4) AI chatbots may exhibit inconsistencies in their payoff\npreferences across different games; (5) Different AI chatbots exhibit\ndistinct behavioral patterns in games, which can be further distin-\nguished in our analyses. These findings highlight the effectiveness\nof our behavioral benchmark in profiling and differentiating AI\nchatbots.\nWe hope our research contributes to a deeper understanding of\nAI behaviors and serves as a foundation for future studies in AI\nbehavioral science. For example, the discrepancies between Turing\ntest results and distribution dissimilarities highlight the need for\nfurther alignment objectives that enable LLMs to better represent\nthe diversity of the human behaviors. Additionally, the observed\ninconsistencies in AI behaviors across games underscore the im-\nportance of developing generalizable preferences and objectives for\nAI systems that can adapt effectively across various scenarios.\nXie et al.\n```\n\n#### 5. 学生问题\n问题1：介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」\n问题2：这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？\n问题3：这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？\n\n\n请输出论文总结\n### 输出格式（输出语言用中文）\n```\n## 💡 解答问题1 (...复述学生问题1...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (...复述学生问题2...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (...复述学生问题3...)\n...\n```\n","llm_summary_res":"## 🌟 论文解读 | 探索大型语言模型在行为经济学游戏中的行为模式\n\n## 📌 背景痛点\/本文动机\n随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在各个领域的广泛应用，理解这些模型的决策策略和行为模式变得至关重要。这不仅有助于优化它们在特定应用中的性能，还能更好地评估它们的可靠性和可预测性，尤其是在涉及重大责任的情境中。然而，目前对于不同LLMs的行为模式的研究仍然有限，尤其是在行为经济学游戏中的表现。\n\n## 🚀 核心方法\n💡 创新点1：通过行为经济学游戏评估LLMs\n本文通过一系列经典的行为经济学游戏，如独裁者游戏、最后通牒游戏、信任游戏、公共物品游戏、炸弹风险游戏和囚徒困境游戏，对五种领先的LLM-based聊天机器人进行了全面分析。这些游戏旨在测试LLMs在信任、公平、风险规避、利他主义和合作等方面的行为模式。\n\n💡 创新点2：引入行为图灵测试和分布相似性测试\n为了评估LLMs的行为模式，本文引入了行为图灵测试和分布相似性测试。行为图灵测试通过比较LLMs和人类的行为分布，评估LLMs是否能够模仿人类的行为。分布相似性测试则使用Wasserstein距离来衡量LLMs的行为分布与人类行为分布之间的相似度。\n\n## 📈 实验结果\n实验结果表明，所有测试的聊天机器人都能成功地捕捉到特定的人类行为模式，导致决策分布高度集中。尽管旗舰聊天机器人表现出显著的通过图灵测试的概率，但它们只能产生与人类相似的行为分布。与人类相比，聊天机器人在收益偏好上更强调公平性。聊天机器人在不同游戏中的收益偏好可能存在不一致性。不同的聊天机器人在游戏中表现出不同的行为模式，这些模式可以通过图灵测试结果、收益偏好和行为的连贯性进一步区分。\n\n## 💬 可借鉴之处\n本文的研究结果为理解LLMs的行为模式提供了有价值的见解，并为未来在AI行为科学领域的研究奠定了基础。研究结果表明，LLMs在模仿人类行为方面仍然存在局限性，需要进一步的研究来提高LLMs在行为经济学游戏中的表现。此外，LLMs在不同游戏中的行为不一致性也表明，需要开发更通用的偏好和目标，以便LLMs能够有效地适应各种情境。","llm_summary_res_status":200,"order":30,"query_answer":"## 💡 解答问题1 (介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」)\n\n这篇论文提出的benchmark是通过一系列行为经济学游戏来评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的行为模式。这些游戏包括独裁者游戏、最后通牒游戏、信任游戏、公共物品游戏、炸弹风险游戏和囚徒困境游戏。通过这些游戏，研究者可以测试LLMs在信任、公平、风险规避、利他主义和合作等方面的行为模式。此外，论文还引入了行为图灵测试和分布相似性测试来评估LLMs的行为模式。行为图灵测试通过比较LLMs和人类的行为分布，评估LLMs是否能够模仿人类的行为。分布相似性测试则使用Wasserstein距离来衡量LLMs的行为分布与人类行为分布之间的相似度。\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？)\n\n论文中没有明确说明这个benchmark需要什么设备条件。但是，由于LLMs通常需要大量的计算资源，因此进行这个benchmark可能需要高性能的计算设备，例如具有多个GPU和大量内存的服务器。至于本文的模型训练和推理使用了什么设备，论文中也没有明确说明。\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？)\n\n论文中没有明确说明这个benchmark的环境是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励。但是，由于这个benchmark是通过一系列行为经济学游戏来评估LLMs的行为模式，因此可能需要设计合适的奖励机制来引导LLMs在游戏中表现出期望的行为。此外，由于RL类模型通常需要大量的训练数据和时间，因此在这个benchmark上大放异彩可能需要更多的研究和开发工作。","query_answer_status":200}

The research advances in this area have a profound impact\non a broad range of real-world applications [13, 34, 35, 37].

For each advertiser’s unique\nobjective (I), auto-bidding agent make bid decision-making (II) for continuously arriving ad oppor-\ntunities, and compete against each other in the ad auction (III). Then, each agent may win some\nimpressions (IV), which may be exposed to users and potentially result in conversions. Finally, the\nagents’ performance (V) will be reported to advertisers.\nmore than $600 billion in 2023, is perhaps one of the most representative applications that calls for so-\nphisticated decision-making solutions in large-scale games. More specifically, as shown in Figure 1, a\nsignificant part of online advertising is based on real-time bidding (RTB), a process in which advertis-\ning inventory is bought and sold in real-time ad auctions. The auto-bidding agents strategically bid for\nimpressions on behalf of the advertisers across a large number of continuously arriving ad opportuni-\nties to maximize performance, subject to certain constraints such as return-on-investment (ROI) [28].\nBid decision-making in large-scale ad auctions is a concrete example of decision-making in\nlarge-scale games. However, researchers usually only have limited access to realistic large-scale\nad auction environments, hindering the research proccess in this area. Although a few existing\nworks provide certain environments, there remains a considerable gap between these environments\nand the real-world environments. For instance, AuctionGym [18] overlooks changes in advertiser\nbudgets across multiple auction rounds, while AdCraft [11] models competing bidders by sampling\nfrom a parameterized distribution, an approach that falls short of fully capturing the essence of the\nmulti-agent dynamics inherent to this problem.\nIn this paper, we present AuctionNet, a benchmark for bid decision-making in large-scale ad auctions\nderived from a real-world online advertising platform. AuctionNet is composed of three parts: an ad\nauction environment, a pre-generated dataset based on the environment, and performance evaluations\nof a couple of baseline bid decision-making algorithms.\nMore specifically, the environment\neffectively replicates the integrity and complexity of real-world ad auctions with the interaction of\nseveral modules: the ad opportunity generation module employs deep generative networks to bridge\nthe gap between simulated and real-world data while mitigating the risk of sensitive data exposure;\nthe bidding module implements diverse auto-bidding agents trained with different decision-making\nalgorithms; and the auction module is anchored in the classic and popular Generalized Second Price\n(GSP) [9, 23, 7] auction but also allows customization of auction mechanisms as needed. To facilitate\nresearch and provide insights into the game environment, we also pre-generated a substantial dataset\nbased on the environment. The dataset contains 10 million ad opportunities, 48 diverse auto-bidding\nagents, and over 500 million auction records. Performance evaluations of baseline algorithms such\nas linear programming, reinforcement learning, and generative models for bid decision-making are\nalso presented as a part of AuctionNet.\nWe believe that AuctionNet is applicable not only to research on bid decision-making algorithms in\nad auctions but also to the general area of decision-making in large-scale games. It can also benefit\n2\nresearchers in a broader range of areas such as reinforcement learning, generative models, operational\nresearch, and mechanism design.\n2\nThe Decision-Making Problem Concerned\nIn this paper, we are concerned with the auto-bidding problem in ad auctions. We use a Partially\nObservable Stochastic Game (POSG)[14] to formulate the problem. A POSG M can be represented\nas a tuple M = {S, A, P, r, γ, Z, O, I, T}, where I = {1, 2, · · · , n} is the set of all the agents, T\nis the horizon, i.e., the number of time steps in one episode, S is the state space and A is the action\nspace, P(·|s, a) : S × A →∆(S) is the transition probability, γ is the discount factor, Z is the\nobservation space, O(s, i) : S × I →Z is the mapping from state to observation for each agent i,\nr = r1 × r2 × · · · × rn is the joint reward function of all the agents, and ri(s, a) : S × A →R is the\nindividual reward function for each agent i, where a = (a1, a2, · · · , an) ∈A = A1 ×A2 ×· · ·×An\nis the joint action of all the agents.\nSpecifically, the interaction in one time step is as follows: The state s = (ω, u, q, v) consists of\nbudgets ω, ad opportunity features u, advertiser features q such as industry category, corresponding\nvalue matrix v = {vij}, where vij is the value of ad opportunity j for agent i. Agent i’s observation\noi = (ωi, ui, qi, vi) ∈Z contains only part of the information in state s, i.e., agent i may not\nknow the budgets of other agents. A convention in the auto-bidding area [3] proves that the\noptimal bid is proportional to the ad opportunity value. Following this convention, the action of\nagent i is a coefficient αi, and the bids of agent i for all the ad opportunities of this time step are\nbi = (bi1, bi2, · · · , bim) = (αivi1, αivi2, · · · , αivim), where m is the number of ad opportunities\nwithin this time step. Given the bids of all the agents, determined by the auction mechanism, agent\ni will receive the auction result xi = (xi1, xi2, · · · , xim), where xij = 1 if and only if agent i wins\nopportunity j. Agents will only receive rewards and incur costs from the winning impressions, i.e.,\nreward ri(s, a) = Pm\nj=1 xijvij and budget for the next time step ω′\ni = ωi −Pm\nj=1 xijcij, where\ncij is the cost of impression j for agent i.\nTaking a typical auto-bidding scenario as an example, given the definition above, the optimization\nobjective from the perspective of agent i is as follows:\nmaximize\n{αt\ni}\nT\nX\nt=1\n\nxt\ni, vt\ni\n\u000b\ns. t.\nT\nX\nt=1\n\nxt\ni, ct\ni\n\u000b\n≤ωi,\n(1)\nwhere xt\ni = (xt\ni1, xt\ni2, · · · , xt\nim), vt\ni = (vt\ni1, vt\ni2, · · · , vt\nim), ct\ni = (ct\ni1, ct\ni2, · · · , ct\nim), ωi is the budget\nof agent i, and ⟨·⟩denotes the inner product. As for the implementation, we know from our problem\nformulation that ri(st, at) = ⟨xt\ni, vt\ni⟩, so the objective in the optimization formulation is the same\nas PT\nt=1 ri(st, at). For more complex scenarios, we can add the CPA constraint to ensure effective\nutilization of the budget. More details on these CPA-constrained problems are included in Appendix\nE. The decision-making formulation above can be easily extended to various real-world scenarios.\n3\nAd Auction Environment\nTo comprehensively demonstrate large-scale games from real-world online advertising platforms,\nwe have developed an ad auction environment. To standardize the auto-bidding process, we divide\nad opportunities within a period into T decision time steps. Given the objective, the auto-bidding\nagent sequentially bids at each step, using the results from step t and prior historical information\nto refine its strategy for step t + 1. This design philosophy enables agents to continuously optimize\ntheir bidding strategies in order to adapt to the changing environment. Within each step, all ad\nopportunities are executed independently and in parallel. At the end of the period, the environment\nprovides the final performance for the agent.\nThe environment effectively replicates the integrity and complexity of real-world ad auctions through\nthe interaction of several modules: the ad opportunity generation module, the bidding module, and\nthe auction module. To better simulate large-scale auctions in reality, a substantial number of ad\nopportunities are fed into the environment and configured with dozens of bidding agents. These ad\nopportunities are generated using deep generative networks to reduce the gap between the simulation\n3\nQ\nReal-world ad opportunities\nAd Opportunity Generation\nAd Opportunity Value Prediction\nDenoising Unet\nConv\nConv\nConv\nConv\nEncoder\nLatent vector\nDiffusion process\nGenerated  ad opportunities\nDecoder\nSampled noise\nLatent vector\nN(0,1)\nAd opportunities\nK\nV\nQ\nK\nV\nAdvertisers\nGenerated  \nad opportunity values\nTemporal info\nCross\nattention \nCross\nattention \nFigure 2: Overview of the pipeline of the ad opportunity generation network. The generation process\nconsists of two stages. In the first stage, ad opportunity features are generated through a latent\ndiffusion model. In the second stage, the value prediction for the generated ad opportunity features is\nperformed, incorporating both the time feature and the advertiser feature. Moreover, the volume of\nad opportunities fluctuates over time, mirroring that of real-world online advertising platforms.\nenvironment and reality while avoiding the risks of sensitive data exposure. The agents are equipped\nwith diverse and sophisticated auto-bidding algorithms.\n3.1\nThe Ad Opportunity Generation Module\nThe target of the ad opportunity generation module is to generate diverse ad opportunities similar\nto real online advertising data with deep generative networks, as shown in Figure 2. We aimed to\nadopt the diffusion model to generate ad opportunity but encountered difficulties with the denoising\noperation, which can yield unreasonable outputs. Therefore, we followed the approach of the Latent\nDiffusion Model (LDM) [25] to generate ad opportunity. LDM adds noise and performs denoising in\nthe latent space using a diffusion model, and then generates data from the latent space with an encoder\nand decoder. Specifically, LDM maps the ad opportunity feature u to a latent vector y with the\nencoder and reconstructs this feature with the decoder during training. For generation, LDM samples\na random latent vector from a normal distribution and then generates an ad opportunity feature based\non this vector. Let U ⊂Rd be the space of ad opportunity feature data (u1, u2, · · · , uK), where d\nis the dimension of the original data and K is the number of ad opportunities. Let Y ⊂Rd′ be the\nlatent space (d′ < d). The encoder and decoder are represented as gϕ and hψ, respectively, where ϕ\nand ψ are the parameters. The function of the encoder gϕ is to obtain a latent representation of the\noriginal data as gϕ(uk) = (µk, σk), where yk ∼N(µk, σ2\nk) and yk ∈Y is the latent representation.\nIn practice, the reparameterization trick [20] is applied to ensure that this operation is differentiable\nduring backpropagation.\nGiven the latent representation yk, the decoder is responsible for reconstructing the original data\nfrom yk, i.e., hψ(yk) = ˜uk ∈U. In addition to the reconstruction, the latent distribution N(µk, σ2\nk)\nis expected to approximate the standard Gaussian distribution N(0, 1). Therefore, we have the\nfollowing loss function for the encoder and decoder:\nLrecons = 1\nK\nK\nX\nk=1\n∥uk −hψ(yk)∥2\n2 ,\nLreg = 1\nK\nK\nX\nk=1\nDKL\n\u0000N(µk, σ2\nk)\n\r\rN(0, 1)\n\u0001\n,\nwhere Lrecons is the reconstruction loss and Lreg is the regularization loss for the latent distribution.\nDifferent from the original idea of VAE [20], where the latent variable y ∈Y is sampled from\nN(0, 1) in the generation process, LDM uses a diffusion model in the latent space to generate the\nlatent variable. In general, the idea behind the diffusion model is to add Gaussian noise to the original\ndata to obtain variables that follow N(0, 1) and to denoise from N(0, 1) for generation. Given a\n4\nlatent variable y, we denote its noisy version after p iterations as yp. The diffusion model includes a\nnetwork to predict noise ϵθ(yp, p), and the loss function can be represented as\nLLDM = 1\nK\nK\nX\nk=1\n∥ϵk −ϵθ(yk,pk, pk)∥2\n2 ,\nwhere ϵk ∼N(0, 1), yk is the latent embedding of uk, and pk is uniformly sampled from the set\n{1, 2, · · · , pmax}. The network ϵθ(yp, p) is the only learnable component in the diffusion model,\nwhich enables the process of adding noise and denoising through basic operations.\nAs for the generation process, a latent variable ¯y is sampled from N(0, 1), and ˜y is obtained through\npmax denoising steps from ¯y using the noise prediction network ϵθ. Finally, the decoder generates an\nad opportunity feature based on ˜y as ˜u = hψ(˜y).\nGiven an ad opportunity feature uk, we also need to determine the value of this ad opportunity\ncombined with the category information of the corresponding advertiser qk and the time information\nutime\nk\n, where qk is the advertiser information in the real-world data associated with uk. We use\nMulti-head Attention (MHA) [31] as the network architecture for information integration. Let vξ\nrepresent the value prediction module, and vξ(uk, qk, utime\nk\n) denote the predicted value of the ad\nopportunity feature uk for a specific advertiser at a specific time step. The loss of the value prediction\nmodel is shown below:\nLpred = 1\nK\nK\nX\nk=1\n\r\rvk −vξ(uk, qk, utime\nk\n)\n\r\r2\n2 ,\nwhere vk is the true value of the ad opportunity in the record associated with uk.\n3.2\nThe Bidding Module\nThe bidding module replicates the dynamic competition between advertisers, each of whom has\ndistinct advertising objectives and utilizes a separate auto-bidding agent, while remaining unaware\nof their competitors’ strategies. Researchers can control a subset of the agents in the environment,\nwhile other agents remain uncontrollable, thereby better reflecting the complex and dynamic game in\nreal-world online advertising.\nSeveral algorithms in the auto-bidding area have been implemented as baselines, including the PID\nController [36], Online LP [15], IQL [21], Behavior Cloning [30], and Decision Transformer [8].\nThis facilitates researchers who are interested in quickly starting up and evaluating these baselines in\na unified environment.\n3.3\nThe Auction Module\nThe task of the auction module is to determine the winner and the winning price given all the bids\nfrom agents for ad opportunities. The costs for agents will vary depending on the different auction\nrules. The most commonly discussed auction rule is the Generalized Second-Price (GSP) Auction,\nwhich stipulates that the winner pays a cost slightly higher than the second-highest bid rather than\nthe highest bid. The auction module internally supports several popular auction rules, including\nGSP, for the convenience of researchers. Additionally, researchers can design specific auction rules\ntailored to their purposes using the interface of the auction module.\nAdditionally, the property of multiple slots has been implemented in the environment. Multiple slots\narise from applications in the industry, meaning that a single ad opportunity may have multiple ad\nslots for display. A slot with a higher exposure rate is more valuable to advertisers. Suppose the\nnumber of slots is l, then the auction module will allocate l slots to the top l bidders, and these\nbidders will receive different values according to the varying exposure rates of the slots. In summary,\nthe multiple slots feature increases the complexity of the optimal bidding strategy, as the exposure\nrate serves as a discount factor for both cost and value.\n3.4\nAPI\nThe code of the environment is implemented in Python. The environment API is similar to OpenAI\nGym[5], so the construction and interactions of the environment may be familiar to related researchers.\nWe included an example code as follows:\n5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\noriginal\ngenerated\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\noriginal\ngenerated\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\noriginal\ngenerated\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\noriginal\ngenerated\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\noriginal\ngenerated\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\noriginal\ngenerated\nFigure 3: The 3D PCA results of 100K generated data and 100K real-world data.\n1\nfrom AuctionNet import Controller\n2\n# Load player agent\n3\nbidding_controller =Controller(player_agent=player_agent)\n4\n# Init other competing agents\n5\nagents = bidding_controller.agents\n6\n# Init auction module\n7\nenvs = bidding_controller.biddingEnv\n8\n# Generate ad opportunities\n9\nad_opportunities = bidding_controller.adOpportunityGenerator.generate()\n10\n# Init the budget and reward of each agent\n11\nrewards = np.zeros(shape=(len(agents)))\n12\ncosts =\nnp.zeros(shape=(num_agents))\n13\nfor episode in range(num_episode):\n14\nfor tick_index in range(num_tick):\n15\n# load ad opportunities\n16\ntick_ad_opportunities = ad_opportunities[episode][tick_index]\n17\n# Collect bids from each agent\n18\nbids = []\n19\nfor agent in agents:\n20\nbids.append(agent.bidding())\n21\n# Simulate bidding process\n22\nauction_res = envs.simulate_ad_bidding(tick_ad_opportunities, bids)\n23\n# Aggregate bidding results\n24\nrewards+=auction_res[\"reward\"]\n25\ncosts+=auction_res[\"cost\"]\n4\nPre-Generated Dataset Based on the Environment\nIn this section, we first verify whether the ad opportunity generation module can generate ad\nopportunity features similar to those in real-world data.

Experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of these models.\nWe randomly sample 100K real-world online advertising data points to compare with 100K generated\ndata points. The details of the generated data can be found in Appendix D. First, we perform PCA\n[19] to visualize the similarity between the real-world and generated data. The 3D PCA results are\nillustrated in Figure 3. For better presentation, we use six different views in the 3D space. We observe\nthat the generated data overlap with the original data in the 3D space. Moreover, the generated data\npoints form four main separate clusters in the 3D space, similar to the real-world data points. These\nvisualization results demonstrate that the generated data generally resemble the real-world data.\nTo further compare these two datasets, we study the value distributions of identity information and\nconsumption behavior information in both datasets. The empirical results are included in Figure 4\nand Figure 5. The feature vector contains over 20 fields, as described in Appendix D, so we only\nselect a subset of these fields for our experiments. Regarding identity information, the generated\nvalue distributions are similar to the real-world value distributions overall, although biases exist for\ncertain terms, such as ’level 7’ for the Taobao VIP Level. Distributions with more categories are\nmore challenging to match, while the gender distributions are nearly identical in both datasets. For\nconsumption behavior information, we observe that the distributions in the selected fields share a\nstrong resemblance and exhibit long-tail characteristics. A long-tail distribution indicates that most\nusers do not engage in frequent consumption, and users with a high volume of consumption behavior\nare rare. This phenomenon aligns with our experience in online advertising.\nWe investigate whether the generated data can capture the connections between different fields. Based\non the observation that users with higher VIP levels typically exhibit a higher volume of consumption\nbehavior, we examine the connection between the Taobao VIP level and consumption behavior. We\nselect four consumption behavior fields. The mean values of these fields across different VIP levels\nare shown in Figure 6. We find that the overall monotonically increasing trend is captured by the\ngenerated data, although biases exist in the specific values. Moreover, the drop in values from ’level\n7’ to ’level 8’ is also captured by the generated data in three out of the four fields, except for the\nconsumption amount. The rarity of ’level 8’ data points may be the reason why the generative model\nis unable to distinguish different trends for different fields.\nIn real-world online advertising, the metrics for bidding strategy evaluation are Click-Through Rate\n(CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR). Bidding strategies make decisions based on the predicted CTR\n(pCTR) and predicted CVR (pCVR), which are the estimated values of CTR and CVR, respectively.\nFor simplicity, in this environment, we assume that the estimations are accurate and define the value\nas value = pCTR · pCVR.

This data can be used to model the\nenvironment and to train the auto-bidding agents ef-\nfectively.\nThe dataset contains 10 million ad opportunities, in-\ncluding 21 advertising episodes. Each episode con-\ntains more than 500,000 ad opportunities, divided\ninto 48 steps. Each opportunity includes the top 48 agents4 with the highest bids. The dataset\ncomprises over 500 million records, totaling 80 GB in size. Each record includes information such\nas the predicted value, bid, auction, and impression results, among other details. The specific data\nformat and data samples of the dataset are included in Appendix C.\nWe have conducted an analysis of the AuctionNet Dataset to provide some insights. We first investigate\nthe variation of impression values over time within a single day. We selected five categories from the\nAuctionNet Dataset and denote them as Category 1, Category 2, and so on. As shown in Figure 8,\nthe impression values of different categories exhibit distinct patterns of variation. Given the budget\nconstraint, agents should consider the variation in impression values over time to bid for appropriate\nimpressions at the optimal times. Furthermore, we examine the relations between the values of\ndifferent categories. The relations between Category 1 and other categories are illustrated in Figure 9.\n4Real-world data show that 48 agents can ensure competitive pressure for auto-bidding agent training.\n8\n5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\ntime\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\ncategory 1\n5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\ntime\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\ncategory 2\n5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\ntime\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\ncategory 3\n5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\ntime\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\ncategory 4\n5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\ntime\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\ncategory 5\nCategory Time Density\nFigure 8: The joint value distribution between different categories and time in the dataset.\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\ncategory 1\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\ncategory 2\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\ncategory 1\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\ncategory 3\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\ncategory 1\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\ncategory 4\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\ncategory 1\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\ncategory 5\nCategory Density\nFigure 9: The joint value distribution between Category 1 and other categories in the dataset.\nThe impression values of Category 1 and Category 3 are positively correlated, indicating that the\ncorresponding advertisers are competitors for similar ad opportunities. Therefore, considering the\npreferences of other agents may be beneficial for developing better bidding strategies. The full\ndatasheet of the dataset is included in Appendix B.\n5\nPerformance Evaluations of Baseline Algorithms\nIn this section, we evaluate the performance of baseline algorithms, such as linear programming,\nreinforcement learning, and generative models. It is important to note that we used the original\nalgorithms from the papers and did not perform any special optimization on the methods specifically\nfor the auto-bidding tasks. We provide a brief introduction to these baselines. The idea of the PID\nController is straightforward: it uses three parameters, λP , λI, and λD, for Proportional Control,\nIntegral Control, and Derivative Control, respectively. In this baseline, the PID Controller is employed\nto control the cost or bids of agents. Online LP utilizes linear programming for the auto-bidding\nproblem. At each time step, Online LP solves a knapsack problem using a greedy algorithm. IQL\nis an offline RL algorithm. The core idea behind IQL is to evaluate the offline Q-function only\non actions that appeared in the offline data, thereby avoiding overestimation in out-of-distribution\ndata.\nBehavior Cloning (BC) is a supervised learning algorithm that uses expert trajectories.\nThe agent’s policy is learned by predicting the expert’s actions in the state of given trajectories.\nDecision Transformer (DT) leverages the capabilities of the Transformer model[31] for sequential\ndecision-making. DT treats the trajectories in a MDP as sequences and predicts actions based on\nprevious transitions. More generative models such as AIGB [12] will also be integrated into baseline\nalgorithms in the future. To better illustrate the performances, we add a heuristic method, Abid, to\nthe experiments. Abid means the agent will give a fixed bid rate for all impressions. Its performance\ncan be seen as a reference in comparison. More details of the evaluation can be found in Appendix A.\nThe empirical results are included in Figure 10. For better illustration, we normalize the performances\nof all baselines by the mean episode reward of the heuristic baseline Abid. Therefore, the mean\nrelative performance of Abid is $1.0$ in the basic task. Online LP achieves the best performance,\npossibly because it is relatively robust and does not require special adaptation for auto-bidding tasks\nto achieve good results. Although methods like IQL and BC perform not as well as Online LP, we\nobserve that proposing optimized solution [12, 22]can significantly optimize the performance, proving\nthat such methods have great potential for optimization. In addition, the drop in rewards observed for\nall baselines during the target CPA task is due to the CPA penalty for exceeding constraints in (4).\n6\nApplications\nAuctionNet has powered the the NeurIPS 2024 competition \"Auto-bidding in Large-Scale\nAuctions\" [1].\nThe competition addressed the critical issue of making high-frequency bid\ndecision-making in uncertain and competitive environments and attracted more than 1,500 teams\n9\nPID\nIQL\nOnlineLP\nDecision-Transformer\nBC\nAbid\nalgorithm\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nrelative performance\nBasic Task\nPID\nIQL\nOnlineLP\nDecision-Transformer\nBC\nAbid\nalgorithm\n2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nrelative performance\nTarget CPA Task\nFigure 10: The empirical results of baseline algorithms on the basic task and Target CPA task.\nfrom around the world to participate, lasting for 4 months. The ad auction environment, dataset, and\nbaseline bid decision-making algorithms used in the competition are derived from this benchmark.\nThe ad auction environment provided nearly ten thousand evaluations for the competition, offering\nparticipants accurate and fair performance assessments. The dataset and baseline algorithms allowed\nparticipants to quickly start the task and stimulated their creativity, leading to more diverse and\ninnovative solutions, thus driving technological development in this area.\n7\nRelated Work\nSimulation environments have been widely applied in decision-making research and have successfully\npromoted the development of related studies [6, 24, 32, 27, 29]. However, simulation environments\nfor real-world online advertising platforms are relatively scarce in the bid decision-making field.\nAuctionGym [18] models the bidding problem as a contextual bandit problem [2], where the\nadvertiser decides the bidding value given the information of the ad opportunity as context. The\ncontextual bandit has only one time step per episode, meaning that AuctionGym does not consider\nbudget constraints in auto-bidding. Moreover, AuctionGym describes the auto-bidding problem\nfrom a single-agent perspective and ignores the influence of other agents.\nAdCraft [11] is a\nsimulation environment for the bidding problem in Search Engine Marketing (SEM). Although\nAdCraft explicitly models the influences of other agents, these agents’ policies are sampled from\nparameterized distributions, which cannot fully reflect the multi-agent nature of this problem. Despite\nthe points discussed above, these existing simulation environments lack data-driven methods for\nmodeling real-world online advertising platforms.\n8\nConclusion and Limitations\nWe present AuctionNet, a benchmark for bid decision-making in large-scale ad auctions derived\nfrom a real-world online advertising platform. AuctionNet consists of three components: an ad\nauction environment augmented with verified deep generative networks, a pre-generated dataset\nbased on this environment, and performance evaluations of several baseline bid decision-making\nalgorithms. The AuctionNet not only provides researchers with the opportunity to study auto-bidding\nalgorithms in large-scale auctions, but also helps researchers and practitioners in game theory,\nreinforcement learning, generative models, operations optimization, and other fields to solve a wide\nrange of decision-making research problems. Regarding limitations, while the generated data in\nthe AuctionNet environment and the real-world data are similar in general, there are biases in some\ndetails, and the performance of the generative model can be improved.\n9\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in parts by NSFC under grants 62450001 and 62476008 and Alibaba Group\nthrough Alibaba Innovative Research Program.

Numbers 1 through 5 illustrate\nhow an auto-bidding agent helps advertiser i optimize performance. For each advertiser’s unique\nobjective (I), auto-bidding agent make bid decision-making (II) for continuously arriving ad oppor-\ntunities, and compete against each other in the ad auction (III). Then, each agent may win some\nimpressions (IV), which may be exposed to users and potentially result in conversions. Finally, the\nagents’ performance (V) will be reported to advertisers.\nmore than $600 billion in 2023, is perhaps one of the most representative applications that calls for so-\nphisticated decision-making solutions in large-scale games. More specifically, as shown in Figure 1, a\nsignificant part of online advertising is based on real-time bidding (RTB), a process in which advertis-\ning inventory is bought and sold in real-time ad auctions. The auto-bidding agents strategically bid for\nimpressions on behalf of the advertisers across a large number of continuously arriving ad opportuni-\nties to maximize performance, subject to certain constraints such as return-on-investment (ROI) [28].\nBid decision-making in large-scale ad auctions is a concrete example of decision-making in\nlarge-scale games. However, researchers usually only have limited access to realistic large-scale\nad auction environments, hindering the research proccess in this area. Although a few existing\nworks provide certain environments, there remains a considerable gap between these environments\nand the real-world environments. For instance, AuctionGym [18] overlooks changes in advertiser\nbudgets across multiple auction rounds, while AdCraft [11] models competing bidders by sampling\nfrom a parameterized distribution, an approach that falls short of fully capturing the essence of the\nmulti-agent dynamics inherent to this problem.\nIn this paper, we present AuctionNet, a benchmark for bid decision-making in large-scale ad auctions\nderived from a real-world online advertising platform. AuctionNet is composed of three parts: an ad\nauction environment, a pre-generated dataset based on the environment, and performance evaluations\nof a couple of baseline bid decision-making algorithms.\nMore specifically, the environment\neffectively replicates the integrity and complexity of real-world ad auctions with the interaction of\nseveral modules: the ad opportunity generation module employs deep generative networks to bridge\nthe gap between simulated and real-world data while mitigating the risk of sensitive data exposure;\nthe bidding module implements diverse auto-bidding agents trained with different decision-making\nalgorithms; and the auction module is anchored in the classic and popular Generalized Second Price\n(GSP) [9, 23, 7] auction but also allows customization of auction mechanisms as needed. To facilitate\nresearch and provide insights into the game environment, we also pre-generated a substantial dataset\nbased on the environment. The dataset contains 10 million ad opportunities, 48 diverse auto-bidding\nagents, and over 500 million auction records. Performance evaluations of baseline algorithms such\nas linear programming, reinforcement learning, and generative models for bid decision-making are\nalso presented as a part of AuctionNet.\nWe believe that AuctionNet is applicable not only to research on bid decision-making algorithms in\nad auctions but also to the general area of decision-making in large-scale games. It can also benefit\n2\nresearchers in a broader range of areas such as reinforcement learning, generative models, operational\nresearch, and mechanism design.\n2\nThe Decision-Making Problem Concerned\nIn this paper, we are concerned with the auto-bidding problem in ad auctions. We use a Partially\nObservable Stochastic Game (POSG)[14] to formulate the problem. A POSG M can be represented\nas a tuple M = {S, A, P, r, γ, Z, O, I, T}, where I = {1, 2, · · · , n} is the set of all the agents, T\nis the horizon, i.e., the number of time steps in one episode, S is the state space and A is the action\nspace, P(·|s, a) : S × A →∆(S) is the transition probability, γ is the discount factor, Z is the\nobservation space, O(s, i) : S × I →Z is the mapping from state to observation for each agent i,\nr = r1 × r2 × · · · × rn is the joint reward function of all the agents, and ri(s, a) : S × A →R is the\nindividual reward function for each agent i, where a = (a1, a2, · · · , an) ∈A = A1 ×A2 ×· · ·×An\nis the joint action of all the agents.\nSpecifically, the interaction in one time step is as follows: The state s = (ω, u, q, v) consists of\nbudgets ω, ad opportunity features u, advertiser features q such as industry category, corresponding\nvalue matrix v = {vij}, where vij is the value of ad opportunity j for agent i. Agent i’s observation\noi = (ωi, ui, qi, vi) ∈Z contains only part of the information in state s, i.e., agent i may not\nknow the budgets of other agents. A convention in the auto-bidding area [3] proves that the\noptimal bid is proportional to the ad opportunity value. Following this convention, the action of\nagent i is a coefficient αi, and the bids of agent i for all the ad opportunities of this time step are\nbi = (bi1, bi2, · · · , bim) = (αivi1, αivi2, · · · , αivim), where m is the number of ad opportunities\nwithin this time step. Given the bids of all the agents, determined by the auction mechanism, agent\ni will receive the auction result xi = (xi1, xi2, · · · , xim), where xij = 1 if and only if agent i wins\nopportunity j. Agents will only receive rewards and incur costs from the winning impressions, i.e.,\nreward ri(s, a) = Pm\nj=1 xijvij and budget for the next time step ω′\ni = ωi −Pm\nj=1 xijcij, where\ncij is the cost of impression j for agent i.\nTaking a typical auto-bidding scenario as an example, given the definition above, the optimization\nobjective from the perspective of agent i is as follows:\nmaximize\n{αt\ni}\nT\nX\nt=1\n\nxt\ni, vt\ni\n\u000b\ns. t.\nT\nX\nt=1\n\nxt\ni, ct\ni\n\u000b\n≤ωi,\n(1)\nwhere xt\ni = (xt\ni1, xt\ni2, · · · , xt\nim), vt\ni = (vt\ni1, vt\ni2, · · · , vt\nim), ct\ni = (ct\ni1, ct\ni2, · · · , ct\nim), ωi is the budget\nof agent i, and ⟨·⟩denotes the inner product. As for the implementation, we know from our problem\nformulation that ri(st, at) = ⟨xt\ni, vt\ni⟩, so the objective in the optimization formulation is the same\nas PT\nt=1 ri(st, at). For more complex scenarios, we can add the CPA constraint to ensure effective\nutilization of the budget. More details on these CPA-constrained problems are included in Appendix\nE. The decision-making formulation above can be easily extended to various real-world scenarios.\n3\nAd Auction Environment\nTo comprehensively demonstrate large-scale games from real-world online advertising platforms,\nwe have developed an ad auction environment. To standardize the auto-bidding process, we divide\nad opportunities within a period into T decision time steps. Given the objective, the auto-bidding\nagent sequentially bids at each step, using the results from step t and prior historical information\nto refine its strategy for step t + 1. This design philosophy enables agents to continuously optimize\ntheir bidding strategies in order to adapt to the changing environment. Within each step, all ad\nopportunities are executed independently and in parallel. At the end of the period, the environment\nprovides the final performance for the agent.\nThe environment effectively replicates the integrity and complexity of real-world ad auctions through\nthe interaction of several modules: the ad opportunity generation module, the bidding module, and\nthe auction module. To better simulate large-scale auctions in reality, a substantial number of ad\nopportunities are fed into the environment and configured with dozens of bidding agents. These ad\nopportunities are generated using deep generative networks to reduce the gap between the simulation\n3\nQ\nReal-world ad opportunities\nAd Opportunity Generation\nAd Opportunity Value Prediction\nDenoising Unet\nConv\nConv\nConv\nConv\nEncoder\nLatent vector\nDiffusion process\nGenerated  ad opportunities\nDecoder\nSampled noise\nLatent vector\nN(0,1)\nAd opportunities\nK\nV\nQ\nK\nV\nAdvertisers\nGenerated  \nad opportunity values\nTemporal info\nCross\nattention \nCross\nattention \nFigure 2: Overview of the pipeline of the ad opportunity generation network. The generation process\nconsists of two stages. In the first stage, ad opportunity features are generated through a latent\ndiffusion model. In the second stage, the value prediction for the generated ad opportunity features is\nperformed, incorporating both the time feature and the advertiser feature. Moreover, the volume of\nad opportunities fluctuates over time, mirroring that of real-world online advertising platforms.\nenvironment and reality while avoiding the risks of sensitive data exposure. The agents are equipped\nwith diverse and sophisticated auto-bidding algorithms.\n3.1\nThe Ad Opportunity Generation Module\nThe target of the ad opportunity generation module is to generate diverse ad opportunities similar\nto real online advertising data with deep generative networks, as shown in Figure 2. We aimed to\nadopt the diffusion model to generate ad opportunity but encountered difficulties with the denoising\noperation, which can yield unreasonable outputs. Therefore, we followed the approach of the Latent\nDiffusion Model (LDM) [25] to generate ad opportunity. LDM adds noise and performs denoising in\nthe latent space using a diffusion model, and then generates data from the latent space with an encoder\nand decoder. Specifically, LDM maps the ad opportunity feature u to a latent vector y with the\nencoder and reconstructs this feature with the decoder during training. For generation, LDM samples\na random latent vector from a normal distribution and then generates an ad opportunity feature based\non this vector. Let U ⊂Rd be the space of ad opportunity feature data (u1, u2, · · · , uK), where d\nis the dimension of the original data and K is the number of ad opportunities. Let Y ⊂Rd′ be the\nlatent space (d′ < d). The encoder and decoder are represented as gϕ and hψ, respectively, where ϕ\nand ψ are the parameters. The function of the encoder gϕ is to obtain a latent representation of the\noriginal data as gϕ(uk) = (µk, σk), where yk ∼N(µk, σ2\nk) and yk ∈Y is the latent representation.\nIn practice, the reparameterization trick [20] is applied to ensure that this operation is differentiable\nduring backpropagation.\nGiven the latent representation yk, the decoder is responsible for reconstructing the original data\nfrom yk, i.e., hψ(yk) = ˜uk ∈U. In addition to the reconstruction, the latent distribution N(µk, σ2\nk)\nis expected to approximate the standard Gaussian distribution N(0, 1). Therefore, we have the\nfollowing loss function for the encoder and decoder:\nLrecons = 1\nK\nK\nX\nk=1\n∥uk −hψ(yk)∥2\n2 ,\nLreg = 1\nK\nK\nX\nk=1\nDKL\n\u0000N(µk, σ2\nk)\n\r\rN(0, 1)\n\u0001\n,\nwhere Lrecons is the reconstruction loss and Lreg is the regularization loss for the latent distribution.\nDifferent from the original idea of VAE [20], where the latent variable y ∈Y is sampled from\nN(0, 1) in the generation process, LDM uses a diffusion model in the latent space to generate the\nlatent variable. In general, the idea behind the diffusion model is to add Gaussian noise to the original\ndata to obtain variables that follow N(0, 1) and to denoise from N(0, 1) for generation. Given a\n4\nlatent variable y, we denote its noisy version after p iterations as yp. The diffusion model includes a\nnetwork to predict noise ϵθ(yp, p), and the loss function can be represented as\nLLDM = 1\nK\nK\nX\nk=1\n∥ϵk −ϵθ(yk,pk, pk)∥2\n2 ,\nwhere ϵk ∼N(0, 1), yk is the latent embedding of uk, and pk is uniformly sampled from the set\n{1, 2, · · · , pmax}. The network ϵθ(yp, p) is the only learnable component in the diffusion model,\nwhich enables the process of adding noise and denoising through basic operations.\nAs for the generation process, a latent variable ¯y is sampled from N(0, 1), and ˜y is obtained through\npmax denoising steps from ¯y using the noise prediction network ϵθ. Finally, the decoder generates an\nad opportunity feature based on ˜y as ˜u = hψ(˜y).\nGiven an ad opportunity feature uk, we also need to determine the value of this ad opportunity\ncombined with the category information of the corresponding advertiser qk and the time information\nutime\nk\n, where qk is the advertiser information in the real-world data associated with uk. We use\nMulti-head Attention (MHA) [31] as the network architecture for information integration. Let vξ\nrepresent the value prediction module, and vξ(uk, qk, utime\nk\n) denote the predicted value of the ad\nopportunity feature uk for a specific advertiser at a specific time step. The loss of the value prediction\nmodel is shown below:\nLpred = 1\nK\nK\nX\nk=1\n\r\rvk −vξ(uk, qk, utime\nk\n)\n\r\r2\n2 ,\nwhere vk is the true value of the ad opportunity in the record associated with uk.\n3.2\nThe Bidding Module\nThe bidding module replicates the dynamic competition between advertisers, each of whom has\ndistinct advertising objectives and utilizes a separate auto-bidding agent, while remaining unaware\nof their competitors’ strategies. Researchers can control a subset of the agents in the environment,\nwhile other agents remain uncontrollable, thereby better reflecting the complex and dynamic game in\nreal-world online advertising.\nSeveral algorithms in the auto-bidding area have been implemented as baselines, including the PID\nController [36], Online LP [15], IQL [21], Behavior Cloning [30], and Decision Transformer [8].\nThis facilitates researchers who are interested in quickly starting up and evaluating these baselines in\na unified environment.\n3.3\nThe Auction Module\nThe task of the auction module is to determine the winner and the winning price given all the bids\nfrom agents for ad opportunities. The costs for agents will vary depending on the different auction\nrules. The most commonly discussed auction rule is the Generalized Second-Price (GSP) Auction,\nwhich stipulates that the winner pays a cost slightly higher than the second-highest bid rather than\nthe highest bid. The auction module internally supports several popular auction rules, including\nGSP, for the convenience of researchers. Additionally, researchers can design specific auction rules\ntailored to their purposes using the interface of the auction module.\nAdditionally, the property of multiple slots has been implemented in the environment. Multiple slots\narise from applications in the industry, meaning that a single ad opportunity may have multiple ad\nslots for display. A slot with a higher exposure rate is more valuable to advertisers. Suppose the\nnumber of slots is l, then the auction module will allocate l slots to the top l bidders, and these\nbidders will receive different values according to the varying exposure rates of the slots. In summary,\nthe multiple slots feature increases the complexity of the optimal bidding strategy, as the exposure\nrate serves as a discount factor for both cost and value.\n3.4\nAPI\nThe code of the environment is implemented in Python. The environment API is similar to OpenAI\nGym[5], so the construction and interactions of the environment may be familiar to related researchers.\nWe included an example code as follows:\n5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\noriginal\ngenerated\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\noriginal\ngenerated\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\noriginal\ngenerated\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\noriginal\ngenerated\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\noriginal\ngenerated\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\noriginal\ngenerated\nFigure 3: The 3D PCA results of 100K generated data and 100K real-world data.\n1\nfrom AuctionNet import Controller\n2\n# Load player agent\n3\nbidding_controller =Controller(player_agent=player_agent)\n4\n# Init other competing agents\n5\nagents = bidding_controller.agents\n6\n# Init auction module\n7\nenvs = bidding_controller.biddingEnv\n8\n# Generate ad opportunities\n9\nad_opportunities = bidding_controller.adOpportunityGenerator.generate()\n10\n# Init the budget and reward of each agent\n11\nrewards = np.zeros(shape=(len(agents)))\n12\ncosts =\nnp.zeros(shape=(num_agents))\n13\nfor episode in range(num_episode):\n14\nfor tick_index in range(num_tick):\n15\n# load ad opportunities\n16\ntick_ad_opportunities = ad_opportunities[episode][tick_index]\n17\n# Collect bids from each agent\n18\nbids = []\n19\nfor agent in agents:\n20\nbids.append(agent.bidding())\n21\n# Simulate bidding process\n22\nauction_res = envs.simulate_ad_bidding(tick_ad_opportunities, bids)\n23\n# Aggregate bidding results\n24\nrewards+=auction_res[\"reward\"]\n25\ncosts+=auction_res[\"cost\"]\n4\nPre-Generated Dataset Based on the Environment\nIn this section, we first verify whether the ad opportunity generation module can generate ad\nopportunity features similar to those in real-world data. Next, we briefly introduce and analyze the\ndataset generated from the AuctionNet environment.\n4.1\nVerification of the Ad Opportunity Generation Module\nIn order to better demonstrate that the generated data can reflect the properties of real-world data,\nthe effectiveness of the ad opportunity generation module itself was verified.

Experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of these models.\nWe randomly sample 100K real-world online advertising data points to compare with 100K generated\ndata points. The details of the generated data can be found in Appendix D. First, we perform PCA\n[19] to visualize the similarity between the real-world and generated data. The 3D PCA results are\nillustrated in Figure 3. For better presentation, we use six different views in the 3D space. We observe\nthat the generated data overlap with the original data in the 3D space. Moreover, the generated data\npoints form four main separate clusters in the 3D space, similar to the real-world data points. These\nvisualization results demonstrate that the generated data generally resemble the real-world data.\nTo further compare these two datasets, we study the value distributions of identity information and\nconsumption behavior information in both datasets. The empirical results are included in Figure 4\nand Figure 5. The feature vector contains over 20 fields, as described in Appendix D, so we only\nselect a subset of these fields for our experiments. Regarding identity information, the generated\nvalue distributions are similar to the real-world value distributions overall, although biases exist for\ncertain terms, such as ’level 7’ for the Taobao VIP Level. Distributions with more categories are\nmore challenging to match, while the gender distributions are nearly identical in both datasets. For\nconsumption behavior information, we observe that the distributions in the selected fields share a\nstrong resemblance and exhibit long-tail characteristics. A long-tail distribution indicates that most\nusers do not engage in frequent consumption, and users with a high volume of consumption behavior\nare rare. This phenomenon aligns with our experience in online advertising.\nWe investigate whether the generated data can capture the connections between different fields. Based\non the observation that users with higher VIP levels typically exhibit a higher volume of consumption\nbehavior, we examine the connection between the Taobao VIP level and consumption behavior. We\nselect four consumption behavior fields. The mean values of these fields across different VIP levels\nare shown in Figure 6. We find that the overall monotonically increasing trend is captured by the\ngenerated data, although biases exist in the specific values. Moreover, the drop in values from ’level\n7’ to ’level 8’ is also captured by the generated data in three out of the four fields, except for the\nconsumption amount. The rarity of ’level 8’ data points may be the reason why the generative model\nis unable to distinguish different trends for different fields.\nIn real-world online advertising, the metrics for bidding strategy evaluation are Click-Through Rate\n(CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR). Bidding strategies make decisions based on the predicted CTR\n(pCTR) and predicted CVR (pCVR), which are the estimated values of CTR and CVR, respectively.\nFor simplicity, in this environment, we assume that the estimations are accurate and define the value\nas value = pCTR · pCVR. Our value prediction model learns to predict pCTR and pCVR and\nsubsequently calculates the value. We predict the pCTR, pCVR, and value for 100K real-world data\npoints and compare these predictions with the real-world ground truth.\nWe hope that the value prediction model can capture the value variation over changes in category and\ntime.

The empirical results show that, in general,\nthe variation trends in predictions over changes in category and time are similar to the ground truth.\nTo present the results more intuitively, we provide additional quantitative results. We compare\nthe mean squared error (MSE) between the generated and original distributions with the standard\ndeviation of the original distribution. The quantitative results are shown in Table 1. It can be observed\nthat the MSEs are all smaller than the original standard deviations (original_stds), indicating that our\nprediction model can capture the patterns of value variation and is accurate.\n4.2\nPre-Generated Dataset\nTable 1: The comparison of the MSE between\nthe generated and original distribution with\nthe standard deviation of the original distribu-\ntion.\noriginal_std\nMSE\npCVR_category\n0.0685\n0.0341\npCTR_category\n0.0517\n0.0280\nvalue_category\n0.00573\n0.00496\npCVR_time\n0.0637\n0.0313\npCTR_time\n0.0590\n0.0259\nvalue_time\n0.00625\n0.00176\nThe dataset is derived from game data generated\nwithin the environment, where numerous auto-\nbidding agents compete against each other.\nWe\nhave pre-generated large-scale game data to assist\nresearchers in gaining deeper insights into the auc-\ntion ecosystem. This data can be used to model the\nenvironment and to train the auto-bidding agents ef-\nfectively.\nThe dataset contains 10 million ad opportunities, in-\ncluding 21 advertising episodes. Each episode con-\ntains more than 500,000 ad opportunities, divided\ninto 48 steps. Each opportunity includes the top 48 agents4 with the highest bids. The dataset\ncomprises over 500 million records, totaling 80 GB in size. Each record includes information such\nas the predicted value, bid, auction, and impression results, among other details. The specific data\nformat and data samples of the dataset are included in Appendix C.\nWe have conducted an analysis of the AuctionNet Dataset to provide some insights. We first investigate\nthe variation of impression values over time within a single day. We selected five categories from the\nAuctionNet Dataset and denote them as Category 1, Category 2, and so on. As shown in Figure 8,\nthe impression values of different categories exhibit distinct patterns of variation. Given the budget\nconstraint, agents should consider the variation in impression values over time to bid for appropriate\nimpressions at the optimal times. Furthermore, we examine the relations between the values of\ndifferent categories. The relations between Category 1 and other categories are illustrated in Figure 9.\n4Real-world data show that 48 agents can ensure competitive pressure for auto-bidding agent training.\n8\n5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\ntime\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\ncategory 1\n5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\ntime\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\ncategory 2\n5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\ntime\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\ncategory 3\n5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\ntime\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\ncategory 4\n5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\ntime\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\ncategory 5\nCategory Time Density\nFigure 8: The joint value distribution between different categories and time in the dataset.\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\ncategory 1\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\ncategory 2\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\ncategory 1\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\ncategory 3\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\ncategory 1\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\ncategory 4\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\ncategory 1\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\ncategory 5\nCategory Density\nFigure 9: The joint value distribution between Category 1 and other categories in the dataset.\nThe impression values of Category 1 and Category 3 are positively correlated, indicating that the\ncorresponding advertisers are competitors for similar ad opportunities. Therefore, considering the\npreferences of other agents may be beneficial for developing better bidding strategies. The full\ndatasheet of the dataset is included in Appendix B.\n5\nPerformance Evaluations of Baseline Algorithms\nIn this section, we evaluate the performance of baseline algorithms, such as linear programming,\nreinforcement learning, and generative models. It is important to note that we used the original\nalgorithms from the papers and did not perform any special optimization on the methods specifically\nfor the auto-bidding tasks. We provide a brief introduction to these baselines. The idea of the PID\nController is straightforward: it uses three parameters, λP , λI, and λD, for Proportional Control,\nIntegral Control, and Derivative Control, respectively. In this baseline, the PID Controller is employed\nto control the cost or bids of agents. Online LP utilizes linear programming for the auto-bidding\nproblem. At each time step, Online LP solves a knapsack problem using a greedy algorithm. IQL\nis an offline RL algorithm. The core idea behind IQL is to evaluate the offline Q-function only\non actions that appeared in the offline data, thereby avoiding overestimation in out-of-distribution\ndata.\nBehavior Cloning (BC) is a supervised learning algorithm that uses expert trajectories.\nThe agent’s policy is learned by predicting the expert’s actions in the state of given trajectories.\nDecision Transformer (DT) leverages the capabilities of the Transformer model[31] for sequential\ndecision-making. DT treats the trajectories in a MDP as sequences and predicts actions based on\nprevious transitions. More generative models such as AIGB [12] will also be integrated into baseline\nalgorithms in the future. To better illustrate the performances, we add a heuristic method, Abid, to\nthe experiments. Abid means the agent will give a fixed bid rate for all impressions. Its performance\ncan be seen as a reference in comparison. More details of the evaluation can be found in Appendix A.\nThe empirical results are included in Figure 10. For better illustration, we normalize the performances\nof all baselines by the mean episode reward of the heuristic baseline Abid. Therefore, the mean\nrelative performance of Abid is $1.0$ in the basic task. Online LP achieves the best performance,\npossibly because it is relatively robust and does not require special adaptation for auto-bidding tasks\nto achieve good results. Although methods like IQL and BC perform not as well as Online LP, we\nobserve that proposing optimized solution [12, 22]can significantly optimize the performance, proving\nthat such methods have great potential for optimization. In addition, the drop in rewards observed for\nall baselines during the target CPA task is due to the CPA penalty for exceeding constraints in (4).\n6\nApplications\nAuctionNet has powered the the NeurIPS 2024 competition \"Auto-bidding in Large-Scale\nAuctions\" [1].\nThe competition addressed the critical issue of making high-frequency bid\ndecision-making in uncertain and competitive environments and attracted more than 1,500 teams\n9\nPID\nIQL\nOnlineLP\nDecision-Transformer\nBC\nAbid\nalgorithm\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nrelative performance\nBasic Task\nPID\nIQL\nOnlineLP\nDecision-Transformer\nBC\nAbid\nalgorithm\n2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nrelative performance\nTarget CPA Task\nFigure 10: The empirical results of baseline algorithms on the basic task and Target CPA task.\nfrom around the world to participate, lasting for 4 months. The ad auction environment, dataset, and\nbaseline bid decision-making algorithms used in the competition are derived from this benchmark.\nThe ad auction environment provided nearly ten thousand evaluations for the competition, offering\nparticipants accurate and fair performance assessments. The dataset and baseline algorithms allowed\nparticipants to quickly start the task and stimulated their creativity, leading to more diverse and\ninnovative solutions, thus driving technological development in this area.\n7\nRelated Work\nSimulation environments have been widely applied in decision-making research and have successfully\npromoted the development of related studies [6, 24, 32, 27, 29]. However, simulation environments\nfor real-world online advertising platforms are relatively scarce in the bid decision-making field.\nAuctionGym [18] models the bidding problem as a contextual bandit problem [2], where the\nadvertiser decides the bidding value given the information of the ad opportunity as context. The\ncontextual bandit has only one time step per episode, meaning that AuctionGym does not consider\nbudget constraints in auto-bidding. Moreover, AuctionGym describes the auto-bidding problem\nfrom a single-agent perspective and ignores the influence of other agents.\nAdCraft [11] is a\nsimulation environment for the bidding problem in Search Engine Marketing (SEM). Although\nAdCraft explicitly models the influences of other agents, these agents’ policies are sampled from\nparameterized distributions, which cannot fully reflect the multi-agent nature of this problem. Despite\nthe points discussed above, these existing simulation environments lack data-driven methods for\nmodeling real-world online advertising platforms.\n8\nConclusion and Limitations\nWe present AuctionNet, a benchmark for bid decision-making in large-scale ad auctions derived\nfrom a real-world online advertising platform. AuctionNet consists of three components: an ad\nauction environment augmented with verified deep generative networks, a pre-generated dataset\nbased on this environment, and performance evaluations of several baseline bid decision-making\nalgorithms. The AuctionNet not only provides researchers with the opportunity to study auto-bidding\nalgorithms in large-scale auctions, but also helps researchers and practitioners in game theory,\nreinforcement learning, generative models, operations optimization, and other fields to solve a wide\nrange of decision-making research problems. Regarding limitations, while the generated data in\nthe AuctionNet environment and the real-world data are similar in general, there are biases in some\ndetails, and the performance of the generative model can be improved.\n9\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in parts by NSFC under grants 62450001 and 62476008 and Alibaba Group\nthrough Alibaba Innovative Research Program.

INTRODUCTION\nBefore the emergence of large language models (LLMs)\nfor code [1], program synthesis in imperative or object-\noriented languages like Python or Java was considered highly\nchallenging due to the combinatorial explosion of the search\nspace [2]. Therefore, most solvable tasks were restricted to\nsimple problem domains such as string manipulation or list\nsorting, typically implemented within a predefined domain-\nspecific language (DSL) [3]. Similarly, program synthesis\nfor games was limited to simple problems with well-defined\nsearch spaces, achievable only by incorporating high-level\ngame-specific concepts into the DSL [4], [5], [6], [7].\nThe use of program synthesis with high-level programming\nlanguages in game research has hardly been explored. Most\ndiscussions merely outlined its potential applications [8], or\nManuel Eberhardinger is with the Institute of Applied AI, Stuttgart Media\nUniversity, Nobelstr. 10, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany (Corresponding Author;\nemail: eberhardinger@hdm-stuttgart.de)\nJames Goodman, Diego Perez-Liebana, Raluca D.

This function\nis then evaluated within a subprocess (3), which executes the\nprogram in the given task (4) and then the results are reported\nback to the main process (5). The main process updates the\nprompt based on the evaluation outcomes and either returns it\nto the LLM (repeat from 1) for further refinement or concludes\nif the evaluation criteria are reached.\nfocused on the missing aspects of automated game develop-\nment systems to move from game description languages to\nprogramming languages [9].\nRecently, methods for LLM-based program search have\nbeen introduced for the automatic design of playable games\nbased on program code [10], [11], [12] and to generate game\ncontent through JSON representations [13]. LLMs have also\nbeen adapted to synthesize programmatic policies in Python,\nwhich are then converted into a DSL suitable for the target\nenvironment [14], as well as to construct world models in\nPython that approximate reward and state transition functions\nfor simple games, enabling action plan generation [15].\nIn this work, we explore the potential of LLM-based program\nsearch for a wider range of games without depending on a\npredefined JSON converter [13] or on predefined specifications\narXiv:2412.04057v1  [cs.AI]  5 Dec 2024\n2\nsuch as a DSL (e.g., Ludii [10], the video game description\nlanguage [11], or Karel [14]). Our aim is to enable LLMs to\nsynthesize program code that can be used directly, without\nrequiring additional transformations or prior specifications. We\nevaluate this approach across different domains using two\nprogramming languages: Python and Java. In Python, we focus\non synthesizing programmatic agent policies and functions for\nprocedural content generation (PCG). In Java, the method is\nintegrated into TAG, a tabletop games framework, in which\nLLMs design heuristics for board games [16].\nOur goal is not to propose a new method for program\nsynthesis, but to introduce an easy-to-use and extensible\nframework to evaluate the current performance of LLMs for\nthe synthesis of game-related program code. To achieve this,\nwe have integrated five different LLM architectures for Python\nand four for Java, and evaluated 12 and 8 models, respectively.\nFor the synthesis of Python code, the framework consists of\nfive miniature versions of Atari games where the input is\nrepresented symbolically [17], ten levels of the game Baba\nis you, in which various game mechanics are tested [18], a\nvehicle driving environment based on the game Asteroids, and\nprocedural content generation in the form of mazes. For Java,\nthe framework consists of 12 tabletop games of the TAG\nframework [16]. In total, we evaluate the LLMs on 29 different\ntasks. An overview of our proposed framework, as well as\ngames and LLMs used, is shown in Figure 1.\nOur contributions are:\n• We perform an empirical study to evaluate the current\nstate-of-the-art of LLM-based program search for games.\n• We introduce an easy-to-use and extensible framework\nwith 29 tasks that evaluate various aspects of game\nmechanics.\n• We open-source our code upon publication. Currently, only\nthe example prompts for the experiments are available in\nthe repository1.\nII. RELATED WORK\nThere are a considerable number of studies that use program\nsynthesis approaches for games. Butler et al. used SMT-solvers\nto search for programs within a Lisp-based DSL, enabling\nthe generation of diverse boss fights in Megaman [4] and\npuzzles for the game Nonograms [5]. In [6], a method was\nintroduced for learning combinations of logical programs to\nsolve simple grid-based games like Nim. Cropper et al. [19],\n[20], [21] developed a comprehensive benchmark of 50 games\nto recover game rules from gameplay traces using inductive\nlogic programming (ILP). Furthermore, Evans et al. [22]\napplied a differentiable form of ILP to learn interpretable rules\nfor Sokoban. Recently, a method for learning programmatic\npolicies for zero-shot coordination problems in cooperative\ntasks was introduced and demonstrated in the game Overcooked\n[23]. In contrast to learning programmatic policies, there is\nalso work focusing on using program synthesis to explain the\ndecision-making process of game-playing agents [24].\n1https:\/\/github.com\/ManuelEberhardinger\/Benchmarking-Language-Model-\nBased-Program-Search-for-Games\nMari˜no et al. [7] utilized program search to develop strategies\nfor the game MicroRTS, comparing the resulting programmatic\npolicies with those created by human developers. Their findings\ndemonstrated that the synthesized programs performed compa-\nrable to those written by humans. Subsequent research built\non this foundation by introducing improved search techniques,\nincluding bilevel search [25], by guiding the program search\n[26] or by searching in semantic spaces [27]. Recently, an\napproach for combining LLMs with local search algorithms was\nproposed for MicroRTS [28], where the authors showed that\nproviding initial programs with LLMs found better solutions\nfaster and improved the performance of the final programs.\nIn [29], Genetic Programming (GP) is used to search for\nevaluation functions within a predefined DSL for the board\ngame 7 Wonders. This approach resembles our experiments\nwith the TAG framework, where heuristic functions are syn-\nthesized; however, we use Java without relying on predefined\nconcepts. GP has also been applied to generate game agents for\nvarious scenarios, including a fighting game [30], a platformer\ngame [31], a puzzle game [32], and to create explanations for\na maze runner agent [33]. Additionally, Wilson et al. [34] used\nCartesian GP to develop programs for Atari games, processing\npixel observations through predefined mathematical, statistical,\nor list functions.\nA recent approach from cognitive science, known as\nlanguage-informed thinking [35], combines large language\nmodels (LLMs) with Bayesian inference. This method enables\nLLMs to pose questions in natural language, which are then\ntranslated into a language of thought [36] represented as a\nprobabilistic programming language. Grand et al. extended\nthis approach to the board game Battleship, demonstrating that\nthe questions generated by LLMs aligned closely with the\nperformance of human players [37].\nVerma et al. [38], [39] employed neurosymbolic methods\nto synthesize programmatic policies for a car racing game,\ndemonstrating that these programs were more robust than\nneural network policies while achieving comparable rewards.\nWhile this approach shares similarities with the vehicle driving\nexperiments in our work, it is more constrained, as the search\nspace is limited to the provided DSL and our vehicle driving\nproblem requires a planning algorithm to be solvable.\nIn [40], a reactive programming language with a novel\nprogram synthesis algorithm is introduced to discover causal\nstructures represented as state machines in combination with\nprogram code. They evaluate the proposed method for 2D grid\ngames similar to Super Mario.\nVoyager [41] is a lifelong learning agent for the Minecraft\nenvironment that uses an LLM to synthesize code in the\nMineflayer API2, which is then executable to obtain the actions.\nIn addition, a second LLM is used as a high-level planner to\ncreate a task curriculum for the agent. Moreover, Ma et al. [42]\nproposed an evolutionary approach using LLMs to synthesize\nreward functions for complex control tasks, achieving superior\nperformance compared to human-engineered reward functions.\nThe key distinction between our work and the discussed\nliterature is the use of high-level programming languages\n2https:\/\/github.com\/PrismarineJS\/mineflayer\/tree\/master\n3\n(Python and Java), making our approach applicable to a broader\nrange of tasks without relying on predefined building blocks or\na programming library. The work that is most similar to ours\nand is also used for game environments is [15], where Python\ncode is synthesized to approximate a world model. However,\nthis work is limited to a single, different type of task.\nIII. FRAMEWORK\nThe general framework we proposed is based on an evolu-\ntionary hill-climbing algorithm where the mutations and the\nseed of the initial program are performed by an LLM [14], [43].\nThus, our framework belongs to the group of neurosymbolic\nprogramming methods [44], as we use an LLM to generate\nprograms that are checked for correctness and functionality\nby symbolic verifiers, in our case the Python interpreter and\nJava compiler. The overview of the framework is illustrated in\nFigure 1, which shows the high-level interaction between the\ndifferent modules and processes. Synthesized program code by\nLLMs is always executed within a safe subprocess environment,\nensuring that the main process can terminate it after a certain\ntime limit to prevent infinite execution of the program.\nA detailed description of the complete algorithm is provided\nin Algorithm 1. Our framework consists of two iterative\nprocesses that control the length of the search, defined by\nthe input parameter iterations, as well as the number\nof attempts to generate, repair or improve the program in\neach iteration defined by the input parameter maxAttempts.\nEach iteration starts by generating a task prompt to obtain an\ninitial Python or Java function, and inject and run the code\nin a subprocess. Afterwards, the inner iterative process starts,\nwhere the task prompt is updated and the program is repaired\nor improved. If the function is executed successfully, we update\nthe prompt with the achieved evaluation metric and all relevant\nenvironment-specific details, such as the action trace of the\nexecuted function. If an error occurs, e.g. a syntax problem,\na runtime error due to improper array indexing or similar\nproblems, the error description is included in the prompt for\nrefinement of the program. These steps are repeated iteratively\nuntil the evaluation criteria defined by the fitness function are\nsatisfied or the specified number of maxAttempts is reached.\nThe outer loop is able to stop the current program search and\nrestart from the initial prompt or the last successful program\nfound. In order to achieve this we introduce the variable\nblankRestart, which is an input parameter to Algorithm 1.\nThis is necessary when the LLM tries to fix compilation errors\nin the case of Java or goes astray, such as when generating\nDQN code for the Atari environments, which we experienced\nin the preliminary experiments. This also depends on the\nproblem domain, therefore blankRestart is adapted to\nthe corresponding domain.\nWe explain the domain-specific adaptations of the framework\nin the respective chapters in section V. While the overall\nframework is similar for all tasks, domain-specific adaptations\nare necessary, such as the description of the environment or\nthe game logic, as well as the objective of the game.\nAlgorithm 1 The algorithm for our proposed framework, which\nconsists of two iterative processes that control the length of\nthe search and the number of attempts to generate, repair or\nimprove the program in each iteration.\nInput: task, iterations, maxAttempts, blankRestart\nOutput: program\n1: procedure PROGRAMSEARCH\n2:\nInit Vars: lastProgram, lastResult, lastFitness ←0\n3:\nfor i ←0 to iterations do\n4:\nif blankRestart or lastFitness == 0 then\n5:\nprompt ←GETTASKPROMPT(task)\n6:\nelse\n7:\nprompt ←UPDATETASKPROMPT(task, lastRe-\nsult, lastFitness, lastProgram)\n8:\nend if\n9:\nprogram ←QUERYLLM(prompt)\n10:\nresult ←INJECTANDRUNCODE(task, program)\n11:\nfitness ←EVALUATEFITNESS(task, result)\n12:\nj ←1\n13:\nwhile not CHECKCRITERION(fitness) or\n14:\nj < maxAttempts do\n15:\nprompt ←UPDATETASKPROMPT(task, result,\nfitness, program)\n16:\nprogram ←QUERYLLM(prompt)\n17:\nresult ←INJECTANDRUNCODE(task, program)\n18:\nfitness ←EVALUATEFITNESS(task, result)\n19:\nj ←j + 1\n20:\nif fitness > lastFitness then\n21:\nlastProgram ←program\n22:\nlastResult ←result\n23:\nlastFitness ←fitness\n24:\nend if\n25:\nend while\n26:\nend for\n27: return program\n28: end procedure\nIV. LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS\nFor our benchmark, we integrated five LLM providers for\nPython and four for Java in our framework, namely the small\nand the large version for each model type. From OpenAI,\nwe utilize models from the GPT-4o family3, based on GPT-\n4 [45]. We also incorporate the latest models from Mistral4,\nClaude 3.55 from Anthropic, based on Claude 3 [46], and\nthe latest Gemini models6 [47], provided by Google, for both\nprogramming languages.\nModels from the Llama 3.1 family [48] are included only\nfor Python tasks, as they are not supported by the LangChain4j\nlibrary,7 which we integrated into the TAG framework.

GAME APPLICATIONS\nIn the following section, we describe the experiments that\nwere conducted for each of our target domains.\nA. Programmatic Policies: Minatar\nMinatar [17] is a collection of five games that are miniature\nversions of Atari games. In Minatar, the games are represented\nas a symbolic state space on a 10×10×n grid, where n\nrepresents the number of channels, and each channel represents\nan object such as walls, enemies or the agent. Minatar is an ideal\ntest bed for experiments, as the games are more efficient to learn\nwithout changing the game mechanics of the original game.\nPreviously, Minatar was used in [24] to explain the behaviour\nof agents through program synthesis, but it was only possible\nto explain short sub-trajectories since enumerative search-based\nmethods were used to search through a predefined domain-\nspecific language that resembles Lisp. In our experiments, we\nuse all available Minatar environments, which are shown in\nFigure 2. The game descriptions are outlined below:\n• Seaquest: In this game, the agent controls a submarine and\nis able to shoot bullets. The objective is to save as many\ndivers as possible, while also shooting enemy submarines\nor sharks. Each time an enemy is struck, the reward is\nincreased by one. When the submarine saves the divers,\nthe agent also receives a reward.\n• Freeway: The agent controls a chicken that needs to\ncross a road during rush hour, while avoiding the traffic.\nFor each chicken that crosses the road safely, the agent\nreceives one point.\n• Asterix: The objective of the game is to collect gold while\navoiding enemies. The player gets one reward for each\ncollected gold and the game is over when the player is\nhit by an enemy.\n8https:\/\/openai.com\/index\/openai-o1-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-\nreasoning\/\nFig. 2: The five miniature versions of the Atari games (left\nto right, top to bottom: Seaquest, Freeway, Asterix, Space\nInvaders and Breakout), which are used for the synthesis of\nthe programmatic strategies. Each colour represents a different\ntype of object, e.g. the paddle in dark blue, the ball in green\nand the track of the ball in pink for the game Breakout.\n• Space Invaders: The agent controls a cannon and shoots\naliens while dodging bullets launched from the alien\nspaceship. Additionally, the player must prevent the aliens\nfrom reaching the bottom of the screen. For each destroyed\nalien, one reward is received.\n• Breakout: The goal is to destroy all the bricks with the\nball by controlling the paddle to bounce the ball off before\nit goes out off the screen. With each destroyed brick the\nagent receives a reward of one.\nThe LLMs were prompted to generate a Python function\nwhich can be used as a policy to play the game. The prompt\ncontains information about the game rules, the objective of\nthe agent and also the possible actions of the environment\nand available game objects. The description of the game, was\ntaken from Young and Tian [17]. The prompts for the games\nare available in the code repository9. The LLM receives only\nthe initial state, which is preprocessed from the state input of\nthe environment, a one-hot encoded 3D array, into a 2D array\nwith text descriptions for each grid cell representing the cell’s\nobject. Figure 3 shows an example of the converted state for\nBreakout. All other games convert the state in a similar way\nso that the LLM can process the state input semantically.\nEach of the games tests the LLM for different game concepts.\nSpace Invaders, Breakout and Freeway restrict the agent’s\nmovement by only allowing horizontal or vertical movement.\nSpace Invader and Seaquest allow the player to fight the enemy,\nwhile in Asterix and Freeway the player can only avoid the\nenemies. In Asterix, the player must also collect items in order\nto receive a reward.

For each program, 50 evaluation\nepisodes were performed. Table II shows the average reward\nof all executable programs for each LLM with the number of\nsuccessful iterations in the brackets – an executable program\nthat returns a positive reward. In general, the larger models\nperform better than their smaller counterparts in terms of\naverage reward, with Claude Sonnet being the best performing\nmodel. Only at Freeway the Claude Haiku and Llama 70B\nmodels beat their larger counterparts in the family. o1-mini\nalso outperforms GPT 4o in Space Invader and Seaquest. This\nis, however, not represented by the maximum reward shown\nin Table III. Only in Breakout, Claude Sonnet is the top-\nperforming model regarding the average and maximum reward,\nbut is beaten in three games in terms of the maximum reward\nby Claude Haiku.

Only o1-mini, which is praised by OpenAI for its\nsophisticated reasoning capabilities, performs well in this game,\nbut fails to beat the other LLMs on the simpler games.

The best performing program of Mistral\nLarge is the only program that uses the modulo operation to\ncorrectly predict when the car will be teleported to the other\nside when it drives out of the screen, which was mentioned in\nthe prompt.\nFor Breakout, the best programs of Mistral Small and Llama\n8B only receive points by chance, as they return a random\naction or do not take the position of the ball into account.\nAll other programs are able to locate the ball and also the\ndirection in which the ball is moving and move the paddle in\nthat direction. Claude Sonnet is the only model that correctly\nuses OSLA to predict the next column of the ball. GPT 4o\nalso uses OSLA, but confuses the row with the column.\nIn Asterix, the best performing model Claude Haiku priori-\ntizes the gold, but also checks whether it is moving towards\nan enemy as it approaches the gold. The mediocre performing\nmodels often prioritize the gold without checking if there are\nenemies nearby. o1-mini, instead, uses action values that are\nupdated depending on nearby gold coins and enemies, but is\nstill not able to beat Claude Haiku.\nFor Space Invader, the good performing programs with a\nreward over 20, correctly locate enemy bullets, aliens and the\ncannon. The programs below 20, do confuse sometimes the\ncolumn with the row or only take into account the first alien\nfound in the state. The smallest LLM, Llama 8B, produces\na program that fires when there are no friendly bullets, i.e.\nbullets shot by the program itself, in the state, and was still\nable to get a reward of 5.9 even though the program makes\nno sense at all.\nOverall, it can be said that in the Minatar games larger\nmodels in most cases show a more sophisticated behavior in\nthe programs, but as can be seen with Claude Haiku, this is\nnot always the case. Currently, only a very simple prompting\nstrategy is used, which already gives good results in most\ngames. Using more complicated prompting strategies, such as\nChain of Thought [49] or adding a crossover operator could\nlead to improvements in the programs found.\n6\nTABLE IV: The minimum distance of the best program for the Asteroids ship driving experiments for different rotation speeds\nω in degrees per second.

Vehicle Driving\nThe task is to pilot an Asteroids-style spaceship from its\nstart state to the target, where it should rest until the end of\nthe episode. Each episode is 101 steps. At each step, there\nare 4 discrete actions: NO OP, THRUST, ROTATE LEFT,\nROTATE RIGHT. We experimented with vehicle physics in\norder to make an interesting challenge. Drag is set to be low,\nwhich leads to a high risk of overshooting the target unless\ncountermeasures are taken. At each step, the agent is given an\nobservation of the ship state and the position of the target.\nThe prompt includes some helper classes and functions,\nincluding a Vector2d class and the Asteroids ship, as well\nas a Vehicle superclass. In addition, we add strong hints to\nmake the problem solvable for LLMs, which are summarized\nas follows10:\n• Best solved using search algorithms: try One Step\nLookahead, Monte Carlo Tree Search or Rolling Horizon\nEvolution.\n• Try using a heuristic function that values facing towards\nthe target as well as being close to the target.\n• Try using Macro-actions - e.g. simply repeating each\naction a number of times.\nTable IV shows the results of the driving experiments for\ndifferent rotation speeds ω to adjust the difficulty level of\nsteering the asteroid ship. The numbers are the minimum\ndistance achieved by the best program for five evaluation\nepisodes. Davg is the average of all distances for each LLM.\nThe experiments were conducted with 10 iterations of search\nand three attempts to generate or improve the program. We\nomitted the number of successful iterations because no LLM\nmanaged to stop the asteroid ship at the target position in all\nfive evaluation episodes. A program was considered successful\nonly if it could consistently stop the vehicle within a specified\ntolerance t across all evaluation episodes. In our experiments,\nthe synthesized programs succeeded in stopping the vehicle\nin only one or two episodes within a tolerance of t = 10,\nand thus no program qualified as successful. The overall\nbest model is Llama 3.1 405B followed by Claude Sonnet.\nRegarding Davg larger models generally outperformed their\n10The complete prompt is given in the code repository.\nsmaller counterparts, with o1-mini being slightly worse than\nGPT-4o. For the different rotation speeds, Llama 3.1 405B and\n70B generated the best program in three out of 10 tasks, for\nthe other tasks the best programs were synthesized by the large\nLLMs, except for ω = 30, where Claude Haiku found the best\nprogram. As no LLM successfully solved the problem with a\nsimple prompting strategy in this experiment, we consider it a\ncompelling challenge for future research.\nC. Baba is You\nBaba is you is a complex puzzle game in which the player\nmanipulates a 2D grid environment to reach a given goal. The\nenvironment consists of word blocks and corresponding entities\nthat can be pushed around. By placing word blocks next to\neach other, rules can be formed. These rules are active as long\nas the given word block sequence remains intact. This way,\nplayers can change how objects behave, which objects they\ncontrol, or which conditions must be satisfied to win.\nFor our experiments, we used a Python version11 of the Keke\nis You AI framework [18]. For this domain, we prompted the\nLLMs to provide a policy, giving a short description of the\ngame and the initial state of the level (the complete prompt is\ngiven in the repository). Similar to the Minatar experiments,\nthe state is converted into a text description. The function to\nbe written should use the current state as input and return a\nmovement direction or the command for waiting a turn. Each\nepisode ends after 100 actions or once the win condition is\nfulfilled. A reward is awarded based on the maximum number\nof actions (100) minus the number of steps taken. Thus, the\nreturn can be maximized by finishing the level as fast as\npossible. Each level can be solved in less than 20 actions.\nIn our tests, we queried the agent to solve 10 simple demo\nlevels (see Figure 4). Each of the levels focuses on one\nor multiple key mechanics of the framework such as rule\ninterpretation (levels 1-10), rule creation (levels 2, 3, 5) or\ndestruction (levels 6, 8, 9, 10), and object manipulation (level\n7).

The number of\nsuccessful iterations is shown in brackets.\nMost agents were able to solve at least 5 out of 10 levels,\nwith Claude 3.5 Sonnet being the only model able to solve 7.\nFor Claude, GPT and Mistral, models of the same vendor with\nhigher number of parameters were able to solve more levels.\nFor the Llama 3 models, the 8B model solved one more level\nthan the 70B model but was outperformed by the 405B model.\nSimilarly, Gemini Flash performed slightly better than Gemini\nPro. Tested models were mostly successful in interpreting\nexisting rules. As can be seen, some levels are rarely solved\nby any model. Creating or destroying rules and thus modifying\nthe logic of our game world has proven difficult for all models.\nNearly all models have failed in solving levels 2 and 3, which\nrequire rule creation, and levels 9 and 10 which require a\nrule’s destruction to finish the puzzle. Slight differences in\nthe observed success rate could be due to the low number of\nrepetitions per level resulting in sampling errors: levels 2, 9,\nand 10, which are rarely solved at all, could be affected by\nthis. Chain of thought prompting [49] may potentially help in\novercoming these more complex planning tasks.\nD. Procedural Content Generation\nPCG is a widely studied area in game research [50], [51].\nIn this experiment, we explored whether LLMs can synthesize\nFig. 5: Three generated mazes by algorithms aiming to optimise\nthe longest shortest path objective.

This\nobjective encourages intricate and interesting mazes. Most of\nthe generated code ignored the hint and instead coded overly\nsimple algorithms, placing corridors and walls in each cell\nwith a given probability while usually ensuring that the start\n8\nTABLE VI: Maze generation LLM results.

An example generated\nmaze is shown in the left of figure 5. Occasionally, a better\nalgorithm was produced that mixed randomness, recursion\nand graph search in ways we’ve not fully analysed. These\nalgorithms sometimes produced mazes with no path between\nstart and end, resulting in a score of -1. When they worked,\nthey often produced reasonable mazes such as the one shown in\nthe middle of Figure 5. The LLMs failed to find an algorithm\nas effective as an evolutionary algorithm applied to directly\nsolve the objective. A sample maze from such an algorithm is\nshown on the right of the figure.\nNote that here we are evaluating the effectiveness of the\nalgorithms in meeting the specified objective, which is to\nproduce mazes with the longest shortest path between start\nand end. Depending on the application, this could be a poor\nobjective to maximise, with the best mazes have a mid-ranking\nscore, such as the central maze in Figure 5.\nTable VI shows the results for the maze generation experi-\nment. In contrast to the previous experiments, all small models\nbeat their larger counterparts. The only large model that is on\npar with the smaller ones is GPT 4o, which loses slightly to\nGPT 4o mini regarding the average distance Davg. o1-mini\nalso falls behind both GPT 4o models.

It should\nbe further investigated why larger LLMs have difficulties in\ngenerating good mazes, but this is beyond the scope of this\npaper.\nE.

It is visible that the more\nexpensive models lead to more executable programs. For the\nsuccessful iterations, the difference between smaller and larger\nmodels is not that significant. Claude Haiku is only 3.85%\nbelow the best model, Claude Sonnet, but costs less than a\nthird of the overall cost of the experiments. Being a small,\ncost-efficient model, it is impressive that Claude Haiku beats\nalmost all of the larger models, falling only behind Claude\nSonnet and OpenAI’s o1-mini. This was also evident in the\nprevious experiments where Claude Haiku produced the best\nprograms for Asterix, Space Invader, for ω = 30 in the vehicle\ndriving experiment, for level 8 of Baba is you and was also on\npar with two other LLMs for the maze generation experiment.\nThis indicates that large, expensive models are not always\nnecessary and that, depending on the task, small models are\njust as good as expensive ones, especially when an evolutionary\nsearch strategy is used.\nF. Tabletop Games Framework (TAG)\nThe TAG framework is a bespoke Java research framework\nthat supports the implementation of multiplayer tabletop board\ngames.

As\nsuch there is implicit opponent modeling required for good\nplay strategies. The environment is no longer a ‘simple’\nstationary MDP, but is actively adversarial.\n• The\nTAG\nframework\nhas\na\nnumber\nof\nlocal\nlibraries\nand\ncoding\nconventions;\nfor\nexample\ndecks of cards are implemented via\nDeck<> or\nPartialObservableDeck<> parameterised classes.\nThese are not likely to be present in the LLM training\ndata to any degree, and require the LLM to generalise to\nunseen software architecture details. This contrasts to the\nstraightforward Python with mostly standard libraries of\nthe games in earlier sections.\n9\nTABLE VIII: TAG results by game. Key as for Table IX, plus\nP is the number of players, Best Agent records the model\nthat won the round robin tournament.

Integration of all language\nmodels used langchain4j.12\nAlgorithm 1 was applied to 12 tabletop board games (see\nTable VIII for the full list) implemented in TAG. These\nare multi-player environments (2 to 4 players) with partial\nobservability and stochasticity and varying levels of complexity.\nGiven the additional level of complexity of these games,\nand very different (and often dynamic) action spaces for each\ngame, the language models were not tasked with writing a full\npolicy to play the game. Instead they were tasked with writing\na heuristic function to estimate the value of a game state for\na player. This should be close to 1.0 for a position that is a\ndefinite win, to 0.0 for a position that is a definite loss. This\nheuristic function was then used within a search algorithm;\neither one step lookahead (OSLA) or Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS).\nEach of these games has very different rules and implemen-\ntations in TAG. To achieve the target of a scalable system that\nrequired no hand-writing and tuning of LLM prompts for each\nnew game, two new TAG-specific elements were implemented\nto augment the process:\n1) Automatic extraction of the game-specific APIs. This uses\nJava Reflections to extract information on the methods\nand associated Javadoc on the game state object. The\nentry point for this is the Class name of the main\ngame state. All public information gathering methods\non this are extracted (defined as names matching on\neither get*(...) or is*(...). APIs for any class\ndependencies on these methods, as parameters or return\nvalues, are also extracted and this recurses until the core\njava libraries are reached (these are excluded).\n2) Automatic rulebook digestion. This takes as input the\nPDF of the game rulebook. An approach inspired by [52]\nis used. The rulebook is first broken down into chunks\nof 1000 or 2000 words. The LLM is then given each\nchunk in turn and asked to summarise in 200 words or\n12https:\/\/docs.langchain4j.dev\nTABLE IX: TAG results by model. S.Iter is the percentage of\niterations that resulted in working code. Cost is the total cost\nof all 120 iterations (10 per game) on the LLM and Points are\nfrom round robin tournaments between the best agents from\neach LLM for each game. For each game 5 points are given\nfor first place, 4 for 2nd and so on down to 1 for 5th place.\nZero points are awarded otherwise, including for LLMs that\nfailed to produce any working code for a game. The maximum\nnumber of points is therefore 60.\nModel\nS.Iter.\nCost ($)\nPoints\nClaude Sonnet\n38%\n11.81\n35\nClaude Haiku\n14%\n1.18\n15\nGemini Pro\n48%\n3.22\n31\nGemini Flash\n25%\n0.24\n14\nMistral Large\n33%\n3.06\n20\nMistral Small\n19%\n0.51\n18\nGPT 4o\n48%\n6.95\n31\nGPT 4o mini\n40%\n0.30\n16\nless the information about the game rules. This final set\nof synopses is then fed to the LLM with a prompt to,\n‘Summarise this information in 500 words or less.’. This\nprovides an blocks of text to include in the prompt used\nin the main loop of Algorithm 1 that explains the rules\nof the game.\nThese new tools enable a scalable and game-agnostic process\nto be run on all games. The input for each game is the game\nrulebook as a PDF file, and a Java Class name for the main\ngame state. Additionally, the methods on the main game state\nwere briefly reviewed for meaningful Javadoc comments, public\nvisibility and name convention to ensure that they were picked\nup by the automated API process. An example full prompt (for\nSushi Go!) is included in the code repository.\nThe multi-player nature of these environments also neces-\nsitates a change in the evaluation criterion in Algorithm 1.\nEvaluation used a tournament of 500 games. The base agent\nin the tournament was either a one step lookahead (OSLA)\nagent (for Tic-Tac-Toe and Virus) or a vanilla MCTS agent\n(all other games) with a budget of 10ms and a rollout of 10\nactions before the generated heuristic function is applied.\nA base opponent used a heuristic function of the game score\n(for all other games). All games in Table VIII have the concept\nof score except for Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect 4, which only\nreward a win (+1) or draw (+0.5). To avoid overfitting to a\nspecific opponent, later iterations within a run of Algorithm 1\nadd all previous (working) agents to the evaluation tournament.\nThe evaluation score of each generated heuristic is the win rate\nfrom the most recent tournament, so this is updated to include\na broader range of opponents later in the run.\nFor each game a final tournament is then run between the\nbest agents from each model, for a maximum of 8 participants\nif all models generated at least one heuristic that compiled and\nexecuted successfully. Model performance is then judged by\ngiving 5 points to the winner of each tournament, 4 points to\nthe second-place and down to 1 point for 5th place.\nTable IX summarises the results by language model. Large\n10\nmodels do consistently better than their smaller counterpart in\nterms of both the number of successful iterations (ones that\ngenerate java code that compiles and runs) and in the quality\nof the best heuristics produced. However the smaller models\nare much cheaper to run, and do sometimes generate winning\ncode. This suggests that given a fixed budget for LLM calls\nusing a smaller model for a larger number of iterations and\nruns could be the better choice, although this has not been\ntested here experimentally.\nThere is no major difference between the four model families.\nGPT and Gemini fare slightly better overall, especially in\nterms of generating more consistently valid code; but this is\nin aggregate and there is high variability across games. The\nlarger GPT model failed to produce a single instance of working\ncode for Virus for example (while the large Claude and Gemini\nmodels both had 9 or 10 functional iterations for the same\ntask and prompt). Similarly, on three games the large Gemini\nmodel only had a single iteration out of the 10 that generated\nworking code.\nThe small Anthropic model (Claude 3.5 Haiku) is poor\noverall, but still produces the single best performing heuristic in\n2 of the 12 games. This variability is actually very encouraging\nas gives traction to this semi-evolutionary approach. If each\nmodel gave the same response to the same prompt then\nwe could not make progress (all models use their default\ntemperature and TopP or TopK settings). There is no clear\npattern in terms of which model is better at which type of\ngame, and these results suggest that using a variety of models\nto generate even wider phenotypic variety can be beneficial.\nOverall results by game are shown in Table VIII. One\ncommon reason for failure of an iteration was code that\ncompiled but then failed to execute in all edge cases due\nto poor error checking for division by zero (throwing a runtime\nerror during the evaluation tournament was counted as a failure\nof the iteration). Otherwise the models were often quite creative\nin their invention of undocumented API methods causing\ncompilation to fail.\nThe complexity of API to an LLM is not always the\nsame as complexity of a game. Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect\n4 are simple games that are won by building a straight\nline of a player’s markers (3 and 4 respectively). Each is\nrepresented by a grid of cells. In TAG this is represented by\na parameterised GridBoard<T extends Token> class,\nwith methods that require navigating a deeper class hierar-\nchy and understanding parameterised types. There is a int\ngetPlayerAt(int x, int y) helper method on the\ngame state as well, but the LLMs often fail to write code\nthat compiles due to issues with GridBoards. The game with\nthe highest iteration success rate, Can’t Stop, is also the only\ngame for which the base game state has no dependencies\noutside the core java.lang and java.util libraries.\nSushi Go! had a particularly low success rate for generating\nvalid code. A specific problem here was that the card types\nin the game were represented by an enum that had values\nexpressed in lower case; Maki, Sashimi, Dumpling.\nDespite these values being clearly stated in the Java API section\nof the prompt generated code more commonly used MAKI,\nSASHIMI, DUMPLING. This is presumably because an upper\ncase convention is more standard across Java more generally\nand hence in the training data of the models.\nThese results only compare the agents from the language\nmodel results with each other. In a few cases the ‘best’ agent\nwas not actually very good at the game, and was beaten by\nan OSLA\/MCTS agent using the game score as very simple\nheuristic as in [53]. This is shown in Table VIII. Six of\nthe games (i.e. half) having a heuristic generated (across 80\niterations in total) that could reliably beat the baseline score\nheuristic, and three fail to generate one that is even as good\nas simply targeting the score.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this work we studied and evaluated the current possibilities\nof using LLMs for program search in the area of games for\nvarious applications. Previous work was mostly limited to a sin-\ngle problem or game without being easily transferable to other\ndomains, as the DSL had to be adapted. We demonstrated that\nLLMs can overcome the problem of combinatorial explosion\nof search spaces constructed with predefined DSLs, and that\nLLMs are able to synthesize programmatic policies in Python\nfor the Minatar domain, which was not possible with a custom\nDSL and previous methods. Furthermore, we have shown that\nthis framework can be easily adapted to different applications\nby modifying the prompts, and that it often provides reasonable\nresults even without much customization. We have shown that\neven with the default temperature settings on these standard\nlanguage models there is a very wide range of output for the\nsame input prompt; in this respect at least the models can be\nquite ‘creative’. Running many independent iterations of the\nsame task can create a varied population of outputs. This is\nvery promising as it provides the variation required for the\nevolutionary hill-climbing approach used here.\nWe observed limitations in the quality of the generated\ncode. For example, in the simple 2D vehicle driving task, the\ngenerated code drove the car to the target but then failed to stop\nmost of the time. Much of the generated code fails to run, or\nin the case of Java, to compile. These limitations become more\nevident as the complexity of the task increases. The need to\nuse framework-specific Java libraries in TAG leads to less than\n1 in 5 attempts generating valid code. We believe limitations\nsuch as this could be overcome with more sophisticated search\nand better prompt engineering, but the results so far give an\nidea of the limitations of what can be achieved with relatively\nlittle effort. The addition of tools to the LLM interfaces and a\nmore agentic workflow is a promising area for this future work.\nFor example instead of asking the LLM to generate the code\nin one pass, it could be asked to construct useful component\nfunctions or sub-modules with documented interfaces. In a\nlater pass the model could then be asked to combine these\nsub-modules (based on feedback of performance of previous\ncombinations).\nOne general recommendations that can be made is to use\na variety of models as there can be huge variability between\nthem on a given task. Given a robust evaluation method, as in\nthe 29 tasks here, the smaller models can be much more cost\neffective at up to a tenth of the cost of their larger brethren and\njust as able to produce top quality results if given the time.\n11\nVII.

In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs to directly synthesize\nusable code for a wide range of gaming applications, focusing on two\nprogramming languages, Python and Java. We use an evolutionary hill-climbing\nalgorithm, where the mutations and seeds of the initial programs are controlled\nby LLMs. For Python, the framework covers various game-related tasks, including\nfive miniature versions of Atari games, ten levels of Baba is You, an\nenvironment inspired by Asteroids, and a maze generation task. For Java, the\nframework contains 12 games from the TAG tabletop games framework. Across 29\ntasks, we evaluated 12 language models for Python and 8 for Java.

In this\nwork, we explore the potential of LLMs to directly synthesize\nusable code for a wide range of gaming applications, focusing\non two programming languages, Python and Java.

INTRODUCTION\nBefore the emergence of large language models (LLMs)\nfor code [1], program synthesis in imperative or object-\noriented languages like Python or Java was considered highly\nchallenging due to the combinatorial explosion of the search\nspace [2]. Therefore, most solvable tasks were restricted to\nsimple problem domains such as string manipulation or list\nsorting, typically implemented within a predefined domain-\nspecific language (DSL) [3]. Similarly, program synthesis\nfor games was limited to simple problems with well-defined\nsearch spaces, achievable only by incorporating high-level\ngame-specific concepts into the DSL [4], [5], [6], [7].\nThe use of program synthesis with high-level programming\nlanguages in game research has hardly been explored. Most\ndiscussions merely outlined its potential applications [8], or\nManuel Eberhardinger is with the Institute of Applied AI, Stuttgart Media\nUniversity, Nobelstr. 10, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany (Corresponding Author;\nemail: eberhardinger@hdm-stuttgart.de)\nJames Goodman, Diego Perez-Liebana, Raluca D.

This function\nis then evaluated within a subprocess (3), which executes the\nprogram in the given task (4) and then the results are reported\nback to the main process (5). The main process updates the\nprompt based on the evaluation outcomes and either returns it\nto the LLM (repeat from 1) for further refinement or concludes\nif the evaluation criteria are reached.\nfocused on the missing aspects of automated game develop-\nment systems to move from game description languages to\nprogramming languages [9].\nRecently, methods for LLM-based program search have\nbeen introduced for the automatic design of playable games\nbased on program code [10], [11], [12] and to generate game\ncontent through JSON representations [13]. LLMs have also\nbeen adapted to synthesize programmatic policies in Python,\nwhich are then converted into a DSL suitable for the target\nenvironment [14], as well as to construct world models in\nPython that approximate reward and state transition functions\nfor simple games, enabling action plan generation [15].\nIn this work, we explore the potential of LLM-based program\nsearch for a wider range of games without depending on a\npredefined JSON converter [13] or on predefined specifications\narXiv:2412.04057v1  [cs.AI]  5 Dec 2024\n2\nsuch as a DSL (e.g., Ludii [10], the video game description\nlanguage [11], or Karel [14]). Our aim is to enable LLMs to\nsynthesize program code that can be used directly, without\nrequiring additional transformations or prior specifications. We\nevaluate this approach across different domains using two\nprogramming languages: Python and Java. In Python, we focus\non synthesizing programmatic agent policies and functions for\nprocedural content generation (PCG). In Java, the method is\nintegrated into TAG, a tabletop games framework, in which\nLLMs design heuristics for board games [16].\nOur goal is not to propose a new method for program\nsynthesis, but to introduce an easy-to-use and extensible\nframework to evaluate the current performance of LLMs for\nthe synthesis of game-related program code. To achieve this,\nwe have integrated five different LLM architectures for Python\nand four for Java, and evaluated 12 and 8 models, respectively.\nFor the synthesis of Python code, the framework consists of\nfive miniature versions of Atari games where the input is\nrepresented symbolically [17], ten levels of the game Baba\nis you, in which various game mechanics are tested [18], a\nvehicle driving environment based on the game Asteroids, and\nprocedural content generation in the form of mazes. For Java,\nthe framework consists of 12 tabletop games of the TAG\nframework [16]. In total, we evaluate the LLMs on 29 different\ntasks. An overview of our proposed framework, as well as\ngames and LLMs used, is shown in Figure 1.\nOur contributions are:\n• We perform an empirical study to evaluate the current\nstate-of-the-art of LLM-based program search for games.\n• We introduce an easy-to-use and extensible framework\nwith 29 tasks that evaluate various aspects of game\nmechanics.\n• We open-source our code upon publication. Currently, only\nthe example prompts for the experiments are available in\nthe repository1.\nII. RELATED WORK\nThere are a considerable number of studies that use program\nsynthesis approaches for games. Butler et al. used SMT-solvers\nto search for programs within a Lisp-based DSL, enabling\nthe generation of diverse boss fights in Megaman [4] and\npuzzles for the game Nonograms [5]. In [6], a method was\nintroduced for learning combinations of logical programs to\nsolve simple grid-based games like Nim. Cropper et al. [19],\n[20], [21] developed a comprehensive benchmark of 50 games\nto recover game rules from gameplay traces using inductive\nlogic programming (ILP). Furthermore, Evans et al. [22]\napplied a differentiable form of ILP to learn interpretable rules\nfor Sokoban. Recently, a method for learning programmatic\npolicies for zero-shot coordination problems in cooperative\ntasks was introduced and demonstrated in the game Overcooked\n[23]. In contrast to learning programmatic policies, there is\nalso work focusing on using program synthesis to explain the\ndecision-making process of game-playing agents [24].\n1https:\/\/github.com\/ManuelEberhardinger\/Benchmarking-Language-Model-\nBased-Program-Search-for-Games\nMari˜no et al. [7] utilized program search to develop strategies\nfor the game MicroRTS, comparing the resulting programmatic\npolicies with those created by human developers. Their findings\ndemonstrated that the synthesized programs performed compa-\nrable to those written by humans. Subsequent research built\non this foundation by introducing improved search techniques,\nincluding bilevel search [25], by guiding the program search\n[26] or by searching in semantic spaces [27]. Recently, an\napproach for combining LLMs with local search algorithms was\nproposed for MicroRTS [28], where the authors showed that\nproviding initial programs with LLMs found better solutions\nfaster and improved the performance of the final programs.\nIn [29], Genetic Programming (GP) is used to search for\nevaluation functions within a predefined DSL for the board\ngame 7 Wonders. This approach resembles our experiments\nwith the TAG framework, where heuristic functions are syn-\nthesized; however, we use Java without relying on predefined\nconcepts. GP has also been applied to generate game agents for\nvarious scenarios, including a fighting game [30], a platformer\ngame [31], a puzzle game [32], and to create explanations for\na maze runner agent [33]. Additionally, Wilson et al. [34] used\nCartesian GP to develop programs for Atari games, processing\npixel observations through predefined mathematical, statistical,\nor list functions.\nA recent approach from cognitive science, known as\nlanguage-informed thinking [35], combines large language\nmodels (LLMs) with Bayesian inference. This method enables\nLLMs to pose questions in natural language, which are then\ntranslated into a language of thought [36] represented as a\nprobabilistic programming language. Grand et al. extended\nthis approach to the board game Battleship, demonstrating that\nthe questions generated by LLMs aligned closely with the\nperformance of human players [37].\nVerma et al. [38], [39] employed neurosymbolic methods\nto synthesize programmatic policies for a car racing game,\ndemonstrating that these programs were more robust than\nneural network policies while achieving comparable rewards.\nWhile this approach shares similarities with the vehicle driving\nexperiments in our work, it is more constrained, as the search\nspace is limited to the provided DSL and our vehicle driving\nproblem requires a planning algorithm to be solvable.\nIn [40], a reactive programming language with a novel\nprogram synthesis algorithm is introduced to discover causal\nstructures represented as state machines in combination with\nprogram code. They evaluate the proposed method for 2D grid\ngames similar to Super Mario.\nVoyager [41] is a lifelong learning agent for the Minecraft\nenvironment that uses an LLM to synthesize code in the\nMineflayer API2, which is then executable to obtain the actions.\nIn addition, a second LLM is used as a high-level planner to\ncreate a task curriculum for the agent. Moreover, Ma et al. [42]\nproposed an evolutionary approach using LLMs to synthesize\nreward functions for complex control tasks, achieving superior\nperformance compared to human-engineered reward functions.\nThe key distinction between our work and the discussed\nliterature is the use of high-level programming languages\n2https:\/\/github.com\/PrismarineJS\/mineflayer\/tree\/master\n3\n(Python and Java), making our approach applicable to a broader\nrange of tasks without relying on predefined building blocks or\na programming library. The work that is most similar to ours\nand is also used for game environments is [15], where Python\ncode is synthesized to approximate a world model. However,\nthis work is limited to a single, different type of task.\nIII. FRAMEWORK\nThe general framework we proposed is based on an evolu-\ntionary hill-climbing algorithm where the mutations and the\nseed of the initial program are performed by an LLM [14], [43].\nThus, our framework belongs to the group of neurosymbolic\nprogramming methods [44], as we use an LLM to generate\nprograms that are checked for correctness and functionality\nby symbolic verifiers, in our case the Python interpreter and\nJava compiler. The overview of the framework is illustrated in\nFigure 1, which shows the high-level interaction between the\ndifferent modules and processes. Synthesized program code by\nLLMs is always executed within a safe subprocess environment,\nensuring that the main process can terminate it after a certain\ntime limit to prevent infinite execution of the program.\nA detailed description of the complete algorithm is provided\nin Algorithm 1. Our framework consists of two iterative\nprocesses that control the length of the search, defined by\nthe input parameter iterations, as well as the number\nof attempts to generate, repair or improve the program in\neach iteration defined by the input parameter maxAttempts.\nEach iteration starts by generating a task prompt to obtain an\ninitial Python or Java function, and inject and run the code\nin a subprocess. Afterwards, the inner iterative process starts,\nwhere the task prompt is updated and the program is repaired\nor improved. If the function is executed successfully, we update\nthe prompt with the achieved evaluation metric and all relevant\nenvironment-specific details, such as the action trace of the\nexecuted function. If an error occurs, e.g. a syntax problem,\na runtime error due to improper array indexing or similar\nproblems, the error description is included in the prompt for\nrefinement of the program. These steps are repeated iteratively\nuntil the evaluation criteria defined by the fitness function are\nsatisfied or the specified number of maxAttempts is reached.\nThe outer loop is able to stop the current program search and\nrestart from the initial prompt or the last successful program\nfound. In order to achieve this we introduce the variable\nblankRestart, which is an input parameter to Algorithm 1.\nThis is necessary when the LLM tries to fix compilation errors\nin the case of Java or goes astray, such as when generating\nDQN code for the Atari environments, which we experienced\nin the preliminary experiments. This also depends on the\nproblem domain, therefore blankRestart is adapted to\nthe corresponding domain.\nWe explain the domain-specific adaptations of the framework\nin the respective chapters in section V. While the overall\nframework is similar for all tasks, domain-specific adaptations\nare necessary, such as the description of the environment or\nthe game logic, as well as the objective of the game.\nAlgorithm 1 The algorithm for our proposed framework, which\nconsists of two iterative processes that control the length of\nthe search and the number of attempts to generate, repair or\nimprove the program in each iteration.\nInput: task, iterations, maxAttempts, blankRestart\nOutput: program\n1: procedure PROGRAMSEARCH\n2:\nInit Vars: lastProgram, lastResult, lastFitness ←0\n3:\nfor i ←0 to iterations do\n4:\nif blankRestart or lastFitness == 0 then\n5:\nprompt ←GETTASKPROMPT(task)\n6:\nelse\n7:\nprompt ←UPDATETASKPROMPT(task, lastRe-\nsult, lastFitness, lastProgram)\n8:\nend if\n9:\nprogram ←QUERYLLM(prompt)\n10:\nresult ←INJECTANDRUNCODE(task, program)\n11:\nfitness ←EVALUATEFITNESS(task, result)\n12:\nj ←1\n13:\nwhile not CHECKCRITERION(fitness) or\n14:\nj < maxAttempts do\n15:\nprompt ←UPDATETASKPROMPT(task, result,\nfitness, program)\n16:\nprogram ←QUERYLLM(prompt)\n17:\nresult ←INJECTANDRUNCODE(task, program)\n18:\nfitness ←EVALUATEFITNESS(task, result)\n19:\nj ←j + 1\n20:\nif fitness > lastFitness then\n21:\nlastProgram ←program\n22:\nlastResult ←result\n23:\nlastFitness ←fitness\n24:\nend if\n25:\nend while\n26:\nend for\n27: return program\n28: end procedure\nIV. LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS\nFor our benchmark, we integrated five LLM providers for\nPython and four for Java in our framework, namely the small\nand the large version for each model type. From OpenAI,\nwe utilize models from the GPT-4o family3, based on GPT-\n4 [45]. We also incorporate the latest models from Mistral4,\nClaude 3.55 from Anthropic, based on Claude 3 [46], and\nthe latest Gemini models6 [47], provided by Google, for both\nprogramming languages.\nModels from the Llama 3.1 family [48] are included only\nfor Python tasks, as they are not supported by the LangChain4j\nlibrary,7 which we integrated into the TAG framework. For the\nnew ChatGPT models in the o1 generation, we use o1-mini,\n3https:\/\/platform.openai.com\/docs\/models\n4https:\/\/docs.mistral.ai\/getting-started\/models\/models overview\/\n5https:\/\/docs.anthropic.com\/en\/docs\/about-claude\/models\n6https:\/\/ai.google.dev\/gemini-api\/docs\/models\/gemini\n7https:\/\/docs.langchain4j.dev\n4\nLLM\nPython\nJava\nLlama 3.1 8B\n2024-04-18\n-\nLlama 3.1 70B\n2024-04-18\n-\nLlama 3.1 405B\n2024-04-18\n-\nClaude 3.5 Haiku\n2024-10-22\n2024-03-07\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet\n2024-10-22\n2024-06-20\nGPT 4o mini\n2024-07-18\n2024-07-18\nGPT 4o\n2024-08-06\n2024-08-06\no1-mini\n2024-09-12\n-\nMistral Small\n2024-09\n2024-09\nMistral Large\n2024-07\n2024-07\nGemini Pro\n2024-09\n2024-09\nGemini Flash\n2024-09\n2024-09\nTABLE I: The used LLMs with the specific version or date of\nthe release.\nwhich offers performance comparable to o1-preview for coding\ntasks.8 However, this model is also limited to Python.\nDetails on the model versions and their release dates are\nsummarized in Table I.\nV. GAME APPLICATIONS\nIn the following section, we describe the experiments that\nwere conducted for each of our target domains.\nA. Programmatic Policies: Minatar\nMinatar [17] is a collection of five games that are miniature\nversions of Atari games. In Minatar, the games are represented\nas a symbolic state space on a 10×10×n grid, where n\nrepresents the number of channels, and each channel represents\nan object such as walls, enemies or the agent. Minatar is an ideal\ntest bed for experiments, as the games are more efficient to learn\nwithout changing the game mechanics of the original game.\nPreviously, Minatar was used in [24] to explain the behaviour\nof agents through program synthesis, but it was only possible\nto explain short sub-trajectories since enumerative search-based\nmethods were used to search through a predefined domain-\nspecific language that resembles Lisp. In our experiments, we\nuse all available Minatar environments, which are shown in\nFigure 2. The game descriptions are outlined below:\n• Seaquest: In this game, the agent controls a submarine and\nis able to shoot bullets. The objective is to save as many\ndivers as possible, while also shooting enemy submarines\nor sharks. Each time an enemy is struck, the reward is\nincreased by one. When the submarine saves the divers,\nthe agent also receives a reward.\n• Freeway: The agent controls a chicken that needs to\ncross a road during rush hour, while avoiding the traffic.\nFor each chicken that crosses the road safely, the agent\nreceives one point.\n• Asterix: The objective of the game is to collect gold while\navoiding enemies. The player gets one reward for each\ncollected gold and the game is over when the player is\nhit by an enemy.\n8https:\/\/openai.com\/index\/openai-o1-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-\nreasoning\/\nFig. 2: The five miniature versions of the Atari games (left\nto right, top to bottom: Seaquest, Freeway, Asterix, Space\nInvaders and Breakout), which are used for the synthesis of\nthe programmatic strategies. Each colour represents a different\ntype of object, e.g. the paddle in dark blue, the ball in green\nand the track of the ball in pink for the game Breakout.\n• Space Invaders: The agent controls a cannon and shoots\naliens while dodging bullets launched from the alien\nspaceship. Additionally, the player must prevent the aliens\nfrom reaching the bottom of the screen. For each destroyed\nalien, one reward is received.\n• Breakout: The goal is to destroy all the bricks with the\nball by controlling the paddle to bounce the ball off before\nit goes out off the screen. With each destroyed brick the\nagent receives a reward of one.\nThe LLMs were prompted to generate a Python function\nwhich can be used as a policy to play the game. The prompt\ncontains information about the game rules, the objective of\nthe agent and also the possible actions of the environment\nand available game objects. The description of the game, was\ntaken from Young and Tian [17]. The prompts for the games\nare available in the code repository9. The LLM receives only\nthe initial state, which is preprocessed from the state input of\nthe environment, a one-hot encoded 3D array, into a 2D array\nwith text descriptions for each grid cell representing the cell’s\nobject. Figure 3 shows an example of the converted state for\nBreakout. All other games convert the state in a similar way\nso that the LLM can process the state input semantically.\nEach of the games tests the LLM for different game concepts.\nSpace Invaders, Breakout and Freeway restrict the agent’s\nmovement by only allowing horizontal or vertical movement.\nSpace Invader and Seaquest allow the player to fight the enemy,\nwhile in Asterix and Freeway the player can only avoid the\nenemies. In Asterix, the player must also collect items in order\nto receive a reward. Seaquest is the most difficult game, as the\nplayer has to collect six divers and then reach the surface so\nthat the divers can leave the submarine, but at the same time\nthe player has to shoot down enemies. Breakout, on the other\nhand, is one of the easier games as there are no opponents and\n9https:\/\/github.com\/ManuelEberhardinger\/Benchmarking-Language-Model-\nBased-Program-Search-for-Games\n5\nFig. 3: The text description of the state for the Breakout game\nwhich is included in the prompt.\nTABLE II: Average reward of all executable programs for the\nMinatar experiments with the successful programs for each\ngame.

For each program, 50 evaluation\nepisodes were performed. Table II shows the average reward\nof all executable programs for each LLM with the number of\nsuccessful iterations in the brackets – an executable program\nthat returns a positive reward. In general, the larger models\nperform better than their smaller counterparts in terms of\naverage reward, with Claude Sonnet being the best performing\nmodel. Only at Freeway the Claude Haiku and Llama 70B\nmodels beat their larger counterparts in the family. o1-mini\nalso outperforms GPT 4o in Space Invader and Seaquest. This\nis, however, not represented by the maximum reward shown\nin Table III. Only in Breakout, Claude Sonnet is the top-\nperforming model regarding the average and maximum reward,\nbut is beaten in three games in terms of the maximum reward\nby Claude Haiku. This pattern is also visible in the other\nLLM families where the small model outperforms their larger\nversion.\nIt can also be seen from both tables that it is more difficult\nto find good programs for more complicated games such as\nSeaquest. Only o1-mini, which is praised by OpenAI for its\nsophisticated reasoning capabilities, performs well in this game,\nbut fails to beat the other LLMs on the simpler games. Looking\nat the best programs for each LLM, o1-mini manages to\ncorrectly locate enemies and shoot them if they are in a line,\nwhile the other programs only check if enemies are nearby\nwithout checking if they are in a line. o1-mini is also the only\nmodel that uses the Manhattan distance to move to nearby\nTABLE III: Max Reward of the best program for the Minatar\nexperiments with the same experiment setup as Table II.\nModel\nSeaquest\nFreeway\nBreakout\nAsterix\nSpaceInvader\nLlama 3.1 8B\n0.0\n0.0\n1.1\n1.2\n5.9\nLlama 3.1 70B\n0.6\n8.7\n9.3\n4.4\n6.3\nLlama 3.1 405B\n0.6\n4.8\n9.0\n6.4\n20.2\nClaude 3.5 Haiku\n0.8\n7.5\n12.2\n11.0\n24.5\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet\n2.3\n5.3\n20.2\n6.9\n22.8\nGPT 4o mini\n0.7\n5.6\n3.0\n3.8\n17.8\nGPT 4o\n1.1\n9.5\n7.3\n8.7\n22.4\no1-mini\n11.3\n8.8\n4.8\n10.4\n22.6\nMistral Small\n0.0\n5.8\n0.7\n3.9\n21.9\nMistral Large\n0.0\n9.9\n7.7\n5.9\n11.9\nGemini Flash\n0.0\n7.4\n5.6\n3.0\n13.3\nGemini Pro\n0.8\n6.4\n6.2\n4.8\n15.4\nenemies, while all other programs only try to shoot enemies\nor rescue divers.\nFor Freeway, all of the best performing programs show\nsimilar behavior for each LLM, while the poor performing\nmodels struggle to correctly implement a one step lookahead\n(OSLA) of the cars. The best performing program of Mistral\nLarge is the only program that uses the modulo operation to\ncorrectly predict when the car will be teleported to the other\nside when it drives out of the screen, which was mentioned in\nthe prompt.\nFor Breakout, the best programs of Mistral Small and Llama\n8B only receive points by chance, as they return a random\naction or do not take the position of the ball into account.\nAll other programs are able to locate the ball and also the\ndirection in which the ball is moving and move the paddle in\nthat direction. Claude Sonnet is the only model that correctly\nuses OSLA to predict the next column of the ball. GPT 4o\nalso uses OSLA, but confuses the row with the column.\nIn Asterix, the best performing model Claude Haiku priori-\ntizes the gold, but also checks whether it is moving towards\nan enemy as it approaches the gold. The mediocre performing\nmodels often prioritize the gold without checking if there are\nenemies nearby. o1-mini, instead, uses action values that are\nupdated depending on nearby gold coins and enemies, but is\nstill not able to beat Claude Haiku.\nFor Space Invader, the good performing programs with a\nreward over 20, correctly locate enemy bullets, aliens and the\ncannon. The programs below 20, do confuse sometimes the\ncolumn with the row or only take into account the first alien\nfound in the state. The smallest LLM, Llama 8B, produces\na program that fires when there are no friendly bullets, i.e.\nbullets shot by the program itself, in the state, and was still\nable to get a reward of 5.9 even though the program makes\nno sense at all.\nOverall, it can be said that in the Minatar games larger\nmodels in most cases show a more sophisticated behavior in\nthe programs, but as can be seen with Claude Haiku, this is\nnot always the case. Currently, only a very simple prompting\nstrategy is used, which already gives good results in most\ngames. Using more complicated prompting strategies, such as\nChain of Thought [49] or adding a crossover operator could\nlead to improvements in the programs found.\n6\nTABLE IV: The minimum distance of the best program for the Asteroids ship driving experiments for different rotation speeds\nω in degrees per second.

Vehicle Driving\nThe task is to pilot an Asteroids-style spaceship from its\nstart state to the target, where it should rest until the end of\nthe episode. Each episode is 101 steps. At each step, there\nare 4 discrete actions: NO OP, THRUST, ROTATE LEFT,\nROTATE RIGHT. We experimented with vehicle physics in\norder to make an interesting challenge. Drag is set to be low,\nwhich leads to a high risk of overshooting the target unless\ncountermeasures are taken. At each step, the agent is given an\nobservation of the ship state and the position of the target.\nThe prompt includes some helper classes and functions,\nincluding a Vector2d class and the Asteroids ship, as well\nas a Vehicle superclass. In addition, we add strong hints to\nmake the problem solvable for LLMs, which are summarized\nas follows10:\n• Best solved using search algorithms: try One Step\nLookahead, Monte Carlo Tree Search or Rolling Horizon\nEvolution.\n• Try using a heuristic function that values facing towards\nthe target as well as being close to the target.\n• Try using Macro-actions - e.g. simply repeating each\naction a number of times.\nTable IV shows the results of the driving experiments for\ndifferent rotation speeds ω to adjust the difficulty level of\nsteering the asteroid ship. The numbers are the minimum\ndistance achieved by the best program for five evaluation\nepisodes. Davg is the average of all distances for each LLM.\nThe experiments were conducted with 10 iterations of search\nand three attempts to generate or improve the program. We\nomitted the number of successful iterations because no LLM\nmanaged to stop the asteroid ship at the target position in all\nfive evaluation episodes. A program was considered successful\nonly if it could consistently stop the vehicle within a specified\ntolerance t across all evaluation episodes. In our experiments,\nthe synthesized programs succeeded in stopping the vehicle\nin only one or two episodes within a tolerance of t = 10,\nand thus no program qualified as successful. The overall\nbest model is Llama 3.1 405B followed by Claude Sonnet.\nRegarding Davg larger models generally outperformed their\n10The complete prompt is given in the code repository.\nsmaller counterparts, with o1-mini being slightly worse than\nGPT-4o. For the different rotation speeds, Llama 3.1 405B and\n70B generated the best program in three out of 10 tasks, for\nthe other tasks the best programs were synthesized by the large\nLLMs, except for ω = 30, where Claude Haiku found the best\nprogram. As no LLM successfully solved the problem with a\nsimple prompting strategy in this experiment, we consider it a\ncompelling challenge for future research.\nC. Baba is You\nBaba is you is a complex puzzle game in which the player\nmanipulates a 2D grid environment to reach a given goal. The\nenvironment consists of word blocks and corresponding entities\nthat can be pushed around. By placing word blocks next to\neach other, rules can be formed. These rules are active as long\nas the given word block sequence remains intact. This way,\nplayers can change how objects behave, which objects they\ncontrol, or which conditions must be satisfied to win.\nFor our experiments, we used a Python version11 of the Keke\nis You AI framework [18]. For this domain, we prompted the\nLLMs to provide a policy, giving a short description of the\ngame and the initial state of the level (the complete prompt is\ngiven in the repository). Similar to the Minatar experiments,\nthe state is converted into a text description. The function to\nbe written should use the current state as input and return a\nmovement direction or the command for waiting a turn. Each\nepisode ends after 100 actions or once the win condition is\nfulfilled. A reward is awarded based on the maximum number\nof actions (100) minus the number of steps taken. Thus, the\nreturn can be maximized by finishing the level as fast as\npossible. Each level can be solved in less than 20 actions.\nIn our tests, we queried the agent to solve 10 simple demo\nlevels (see Figure 4). Each of the levels focuses on one\nor multiple key mechanics of the framework such as rule\ninterpretation (levels 1-10), rule creation (levels 2, 3, 5) or\ndestruction (levels 6, 8, 9, 10), and object manipulation (level\n7).

The number of\nsuccessful iterations is shown in brackets.\nMost agents were able to solve at least 5 out of 10 levels,\nwith Claude 3.5 Sonnet being the only model able to solve 7.\nFor Claude, GPT and Mistral, models of the same vendor with\nhigher number of parameters were able to solve more levels.\nFor the Llama 3 models, the 8B model solved one more level\nthan the 70B model but was outperformed by the 405B model.\nSimilarly, Gemini Flash performed slightly better than Gemini\nPro. Tested models were mostly successful in interpreting\nexisting rules. As can be seen, some levels are rarely solved\nby any model. Creating or destroying rules and thus modifying\nthe logic of our game world has proven difficult for all models.\nNearly all models have failed in solving levels 2 and 3, which\nrequire rule creation, and levels 9 and 10 which require a\nrule’s destruction to finish the puzzle. Slight differences in\nthe observed success rate could be due to the low number of\nrepetitions per level resulting in sampling errors: levels 2, 9,\nand 10, which are rarely solved at all, could be affected by\nthis. Chain of thought prompting [49] may potentially help in\novercoming these more complex planning tasks.\nD. Procedural Content Generation\nPCG is a widely studied area in game research [50], [51].\nIn this experiment, we explored whether LLMs can synthesize\nFig. 5: Three generated mazes by algorithms aiming to optimise\nthe longest shortest path objective.

This\nobjective encourages intricate and interesting mazes. Most of\nthe generated code ignored the hint and instead coded overly\nsimple algorithms, placing corridors and walls in each cell\nwith a given probability while usually ensuring that the start\n8\nTABLE VI: Maze generation LLM results.

An example generated\nmaze is shown in the left of figure 5. Occasionally, a better\nalgorithm was produced that mixed randomness, recursion\nand graph search in ways we’ve not fully analysed. These\nalgorithms sometimes produced mazes with no path between\nstart and end, resulting in a score of -1. When they worked,\nthey often produced reasonable mazes such as the one shown in\nthe middle of Figure 5. The LLMs failed to find an algorithm\nas effective as an evolutionary algorithm applied to directly\nsolve the objective. A sample maze from such an algorithm is\nshown on the right of the figure.\nNote that here we are evaluating the effectiveness of the\nalgorithms in meeting the specified objective, which is to\nproduce mazes with the longest shortest path between start\nand end. Depending on the application, this could be a poor\nobjective to maximise, with the best mazes have a mid-ranking\nscore, such as the central maze in Figure 5.\nTable VI shows the results for the maze generation experi-\nment. In contrast to the previous experiments, all small models\nbeat their larger counterparts. The only large model that is on\npar with the smaller ones is GPT 4o, which loses slightly to\nGPT 4o mini regarding the average distance Davg. o1-mini\nalso falls behind both GPT 4o models.

Even\nthe smallest LLM, Llama 3.1 8B, which was one of the worst\nmodels in the previous experiments, is better than the larger\nLlama models in terms of Davg and only loses by a small\nmargin to the largest Llama model in terms of Dmax. It should\nbe further investigated why larger LLMs have difficulties in\ngenerating good mazes, but this is beyond the scope of this\npaper.\nE.

Claude Haiku is only 3.85%\nbelow the best model, Claude Sonnet, but costs less than a\nthird of the overall cost of the experiments. Being a small,\ncost-efficient model, it is impressive that Claude Haiku beats\nalmost all of the larger models, falling only behind Claude\nSonnet and OpenAI’s o1-mini. This was also evident in the\nprevious experiments where Claude Haiku produced the best\nprograms for Asterix, Space Invader, for ω = 30 in the vehicle\ndriving experiment, for level 8 of Baba is you and was also on\npar with two other LLMs for the maze generation experiment.\nThis indicates that large, expensive models are not always\nnecessary and that, depending on the task, small models are\njust as good as expensive ones, especially when an evolutionary\nsearch strategy is used.\nF. Tabletop Games Framework (TAG)\nThe TAG framework is a bespoke Java research framework\nthat supports the implementation of multiplayer tabletop board\ngames. This introduces a number of new challenges:\n• The games are in general more complex than the simple\none-player games in previous sections.\n• Related to this, they are also inherently multiplayer. As\nsuch there is implicit opponent modeling required for good\nplay strategies. The environment is no longer a ‘simple’\nstationary MDP, but is actively adversarial.\n• The\nTAG\nframework\nhas\na\nnumber\nof\nlocal\nlibraries\nand\ncoding\nconventions;\nfor\nexample\ndecks of cards are implemented via\nDeck<> or\nPartialObservableDeck<> parameterised classes.\nThese are not likely to be present in the LLM training\ndata to any degree, and require the LLM to generalise to\nunseen software architecture details. This contrasts to the\nstraightforward Python with mostly standard libraries of\nthe games in earlier sections.\n9\nTABLE VIII: TAG results by game.

Integration of all language\nmodels used langchain4j.12\nAlgorithm 1 was applied to 12 tabletop board games (see\nTable VIII for the full list) implemented in TAG. These\nare multi-player environments (2 to 4 players) with partial\nobservability and stochasticity and varying levels of complexity.\nGiven the additional level of complexity of these games,\nand very different (and often dynamic) action spaces for each\ngame, the language models were not tasked with writing a full\npolicy to play the game. Instead they were tasked with writing\na heuristic function to estimate the value of a game state for\na player. This should be close to 1.0 for a position that is a\ndefinite win, to 0.0 for a position that is a definite loss. This\nheuristic function was then used within a search algorithm;\neither one step lookahead (OSLA) or Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS).\nEach of these games has very different rules and implemen-\ntations in TAG. To achieve the target of a scalable system that\nrequired no hand-writing and tuning of LLM prompts for each\nnew game, two new TAG-specific elements were implemented\nto augment the process:\n1) Automatic extraction of the game-specific APIs. This uses\nJava Reflections to extract information on the methods\nand associated Javadoc on the game state object. The\nentry point for this is the Class name of the main\ngame state. All public information gathering methods\non this are extracted (defined as names matching on\neither get*(...) or is*(...). APIs for any class\ndependencies on these methods, as parameters or return\nvalues, are also extracted and this recurses until the core\njava libraries are reached (these are excluded).\n2) Automatic rulebook digestion. This takes as input the\nPDF of the game rulebook. An approach inspired by [52]\nis used. The rulebook is first broken down into chunks\nof 1000 or 2000 words. The LLM is then given each\nchunk in turn and asked to summarise in 200 words or\n12https:\/\/docs.langchain4j.dev\nTABLE IX: TAG results by model.

This final set\nof synopses is then fed to the LLM with a prompt to,\n‘Summarise this information in 500 words or less.’. This\nprovides an blocks of text to include in the prompt used\nin the main loop of Algorithm 1 that explains the rules\nof the game.\nThese new tools enable a scalable and game-agnostic process\nto be run on all games. The input for each game is the game\nrulebook as a PDF file, and a Java Class name for the main\ngame state. Additionally, the methods on the main game state\nwere briefly reviewed for meaningful Javadoc comments, public\nvisibility and name convention to ensure that they were picked\nup by the automated API process. An example full prompt (for\nSushi Go!) is included in the code repository.\nThe multi-player nature of these environments also neces-\nsitates a change in the evaluation criterion in Algorithm 1.\nEvaluation used a tournament of 500 games. The base agent\nin the tournament was either a one step lookahead (OSLA)\nagent (for Tic-Tac-Toe and Virus) or a vanilla MCTS agent\n(all other games) with a budget of 10ms and a rollout of 10\nactions before the generated heuristic function is applied.\nA base opponent used a heuristic function of the game score\n(for all other games). All games in Table VIII have the concept\nof score except for Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect 4, which only\nreward a win (+1) or draw (+0.5). To avoid overfitting to a\nspecific opponent, later iterations within a run of Algorithm 1\nadd all previous (working) agents to the evaluation tournament.\nThe evaluation score of each generated heuristic is the win rate\nfrom the most recent tournament, so this is updated to include\na broader range of opponents later in the run.\nFor each game a final tournament is then run between the\nbest agents from each model, for a maximum of 8 participants\nif all models generated at least one heuristic that compiled and\nexecuted successfully. Model performance is then judged by\ngiving 5 points to the winner of each tournament, 4 points to\nthe second-place and down to 1 point for 5th place.\nTable IX summarises the results by language model. Large\n10\nmodels do consistently better than their smaller counterpart in\nterms of both the number of successful iterations (ones that\ngenerate java code that compiles and runs) and in the quality\nof the best heuristics produced. However the smaller models\nare much cheaper to run, and do sometimes generate winning\ncode. This suggests that given a fixed budget for LLM calls\nusing a smaller model for a larger number of iterations and\nruns could be the better choice, although this has not been\ntested here experimentally.\nThere is no major difference between the four model families.\nGPT and Gemini fare slightly better overall, especially in\nterms of generating more consistently valid code; but this is\nin aggregate and there is high variability across games. The\nlarger GPT model failed to produce a single instance of working\ncode for Virus for example (while the large Claude and Gemini\nmodels both had 9 or 10 functional iterations for the same\ntask and prompt). Similarly, on three games the large Gemini\nmodel only had a single iteration out of the 10 that generated\nworking code.\nThe small Anthropic model (Claude 3.5 Haiku) is poor\noverall, but still produces the single best performing heuristic in\n2 of the 12 games. This variability is actually very encouraging\nas gives traction to this semi-evolutionary approach. If each\nmodel gave the same response to the same prompt then\nwe could not make progress (all models use their default\ntemperature and TopP or TopK settings). There is no clear\npattern in terms of which model is better at which type of\ngame, and these results suggest that using a variety of models\nto generate even wider phenotypic variety can be beneficial.\nOverall results by game are shown in Table VIII. One\ncommon reason for failure of an iteration was code that\ncompiled but then failed to execute in all edge cases due\nto poor error checking for division by zero (throwing a runtime\nerror during the evaluation tournament was counted as a failure\nof the iteration). Otherwise the models were often quite creative\nin their invention of undocumented API methods causing\ncompilation to fail.\nThe complexity of API to an LLM is not always the\nsame as complexity of a game. Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect\n4 are simple games that are won by building a straight\nline of a player’s markers (3 and 4 respectively). Each is\nrepresented by a grid of cells. In TAG this is represented by\na parameterised GridBoard<T extends Token> class,\nwith methods that require navigating a deeper class hierar-\nchy and understanding parameterised types. There is a int\ngetPlayerAt(int x, int y) helper method on the\ngame state as well, but the LLMs often fail to write code\nthat compiles due to issues with GridBoards. The game with\nthe highest iteration success rate, Can’t Stop, is also the only\ngame for which the base game state has no dependencies\noutside the core java.lang and java.util libraries.\nSushi Go! had a particularly low success rate for generating\nvalid code. A specific problem here was that the card types\nin the game were represented by an enum that had values\nexpressed in lower case; Maki, Sashimi, Dumpling.\nDespite these values being clearly stated in the Java API section\nof the prompt generated code more commonly used MAKI,\nSASHIMI, DUMPLING. This is presumably because an upper\ncase convention is more standard across Java more generally\nand hence in the training data of the models.\nThese results only compare the agents from the language\nmodel results with each other. In a few cases the ‘best’ agent\nwas not actually very good at the game, and was beaten by\nan OSLA\/MCTS agent using the game score as very simple\nheuristic as in [53]. This is shown in Table VIII. Six of\nthe games (i.e. half) having a heuristic generated (across 80\niterations in total) that could reliably beat the baseline score\nheuristic, and three fail to generate one that is even as good\nas simply targeting the score.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this work we studied and evaluated the current possibilities\nof using LLMs for program search in the area of games for\nvarious applications. Previous work was mostly limited to a sin-\ngle problem or game without being easily transferable to other\ndomains, as the DSL had to be adapted. We demonstrated that\nLLMs can overcome the problem of combinatorial explosion\nof search spaces constructed with predefined DSLs, and that\nLLMs are able to synthesize programmatic policies in Python\nfor the Minatar domain, which was not possible with a custom\nDSL and previous methods. Furthermore, we have shown that\nthis framework can be easily adapted to different applications\nby modifying the prompts, and that it often provides reasonable\nresults even without much customization. We have shown that\neven with the default temperature settings on these standard\nlanguage models there is a very wide range of output for the\nsame input prompt; in this respect at least the models can be\nquite ‘creative’. Running many independent iterations of the\nsame task can create a varied population of outputs. This is\nvery promising as it provides the variation required for the\nevolutionary hill-climbing approach used here.\nWe observed limitations in the quality of the generated\ncode. For example, in the simple 2D vehicle driving task, the\ngenerated code drove the car to the target but then failed to stop\nmost of the time. Much of the generated code fails to run, or\nin the case of Java, to compile. These limitations become more\nevident as the complexity of the task increases. The need to\nuse framework-specific Java libraries in TAG leads to less than\n1 in 5 attempts generating valid code. We believe limitations\nsuch as this could be overcome with more sophisticated search\nand better prompt engineering, but the results so far give an\nidea of the limitations of what can be achieved with relatively\nlittle effort. The addition of tools to the LLM interfaces and a\nmore agentic workflow is a promising area for this future work.\nFor example instead of asking the LLM to generate the code\nin one pass, it could be asked to construct useful component\nfunctions or sub-modules with documented interfaces. In a\nlater pass the model could then be asked to combine these\nsub-modules (based on feedback of performance of previous\ncombinations).\nOne general recommendations that can be made is to use\na variety of models as there can be huge variability between\nthem on a given task. Given a robust evaluation method, as in\nthe 29 tasks here, the smaller models can be much more cost\neffective at up to a tenth of the cost of their larger brethren and\njust as able to produce top quality results if given the time.\n11\nVII.

INTRODUCTION\nFrom its inception, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) research has\nbeen focusing on building agents that can play games like\nhumans. Both Turing [1] and Shannon [2] developed programs\nfor playing chess to validate initial ideas in AI. For more\nthan half a century, games have continued to be AI testbeds\nfor novel ideas, and the resulting achievements have marked\nimportant milestones in the history of AI [3]–[17]. Notable\nexamples include the checkers-playing bot Chinook winning\na world championship against top humans [3], Deep Blue\nbeating Kasparov in chess [4], and AlphaGo defeating Lee\nSedol [6] in the complex ancient Chinese game Go. Although\nsubstantial progress has been made in solving these large-scale\nperfect-information games that all players know the exact state\nof the game at every decision point, it remains challenging\nto solve large-scale imperfect-information games that require\nreasoning under the uncertainty about the opponents’ hidden\nKai Li, Hang Xu, and Enmin Zhao contributed equally to this work.\nJunliang Xing is the corresponding author.\nKai Li, Hang Xu, Enmin Zhao, Zhe Wu, and Junliang Xing are with the\nInstitute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and School of Artiﬁ-\ncial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China\n(e-mail: kai.li@ia.ac.cn; xuhang2020@ia.ac.cn; zhaoenmin2018@ia.ac.cn;\nwuzhe2019@ia.ac.cn; jlxing@nlpr.ia.ac.cn).\nThis work was supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation\nof China under Grant No. 62076238 and 61902402, in part by the Na-\ntional Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant No.\n2020AAA0103401, in part by the CCF-Tencent Open Fund, and in part by\nthe Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences\nunder Grant No. XDA27000000.\ninformation. The hidden information is omnipresent in real-\nworld strategic interactions, such as business, negotiation, and\nﬁnance, making the research of imperfect-information games\nparticularly important both theoretically and practically.\nPoker has a long history as a challenging problem for\ndeveloping algorithms that deal with hidden information [18],\n[19]. The poker game involves all players being dealt with\nsome private cards visible only to themselves, with players\ntaking structured turns making bets, calling opponents’ bets,\nor folding. As one of the most popular global card games,\npoker has played an essential role in developing general-\npurpose techniques for imperfect-information games. In par-\nticular, No-limit Texas Hold’em (NLTH), the world’s most\npopular form of poker, has been the primary testbed for\nimperfect-information game research for decades because of\nits large-scale decision space and strategic complexity. For\nexample, Heads-up No-limit Texas Hold’em (HUNL), the\nsmallest variant of NLTH, has 10161 decision points [20]\nwhich makes it almost impossible to solve directly.\nThere have been many efforts to design poker AIs for\nNLTH over the past few years [21], [22]. Most of these\nsystems exploit some equilibrium-ﬁnding algorithms, e.g.,\ncounterfactual regret minimization (CFR) [23], with various\nabstraction strategies to merge similar game states to reduce\nthe size of the game tree. Recently, a series of breakthroughs\nhave been made in the NLTH AI research community. Deep-\nStack [16], which combines the continual re-solving and the\ndepth-limited sparse look-ahead algorithms, defeated 10 out\nof 11 professional poker players by a statistically signiﬁcant\nmargin. Libratus [17] defeated a team of four top HUNL-\nspecialist professionals by using a nested safe subgame solving\nalgorithm with an extensible blueprint strategy. Pluribus [24]\ndefeated elite human professional players in six-player NLTH\nby extending the techniques behind Libratus.\nAlthough many important milestones have been achieved\nin NLTH AI research in recent years, the problem is far\nfrom being solved, and there remain many theoretical and\ncomputational issues to be addressed. For example, the game-\ntheoretic solution for multiplayer NLTH, the best way to game\ntree abstraction, more efﬁcient equilibrium-ﬁnding algorithms\nthat converge faster and consume fewer resources, etc. To\nsolve these challenges, further studies are urgently needed.\nHowever, one main obstacle to further research in NLTH AI\nis the lack of standard benchmarks in this area. First, there are\nno standard evaluation protocols in this community; different\npapers use different evaluation metrics, making comparisons\nof different methods difﬁcult. Second, there is no publicly\navailable baseline AI which can serve as a starting point for\narXiv:2012.06168v4  [cs.LG]  14 Dec 2021\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XX 2021\n2\nfuture improvements. Third, there are no public easy-to-use\nplatforms for researchers to test the performance of their AIs\nat any time.\nConsidering the important role of standard benchmarks in\nAI development, we present OpenHoldem, a benchmark for\nNLTH AI research developed to boost the studies on large-\nscale imperfect-information games. OpenHoldem provides an\nintegrated toolkit for evaluating NLTH AIs with three main\ncomponents: the evaluation protocols, the baseline AIs, and\na testing platform. For each component, we have made the\nfollowing contributions to the community:\n• For the evaluation part, we propose to use four differ-\nent evaluation metrics to test different algorithms from\ndifferent aspects comprehensively.\n• For the baseline part, we design and implement four\ndifferent types of NLTH AIs: rule-based AI, CFR based\nstatic AI, DeepStack-like online AI, and deep reinforce-\nment learning based AI. These diverse AIs can serve as\nstrong baselines for further development in this ﬁeld.\n• For the platform part, we develop an online testing\nplatform with multiple NLTH AIs built-in. Researchers\ncan link their AIs to this platform through easy-to-use\nAPIs to play against each other for mutual improvement.\nOur proposed OpenHoldem provides a standardized bench-\nmark for the NLTH AI research. The adopted approach,\nnamely to propose an evaluation protocol via several metrics,\nthe provision of baselines tested to have strong performances,\nand the establishment of an online testing platform, is per-\nfectly rigorous and will allow algorithm improvements and\ncomparisons with the state-of-the-arts, which impossible to do\ntoday without spending much time re-implementing other peo-\nple’s methods. OpenHoldem can potentially have a signiﬁcant\nimpact on the poker AI research, and more generally in the\nAI community dealing with decision-making problems under\nuncertainty. We hope that OpenHoldem makes the NLTH AI\nresearch easier and more accessible, and further facilitates\nthe research of the key problems in large-scale imperfect-\ninformation games, such as large-scale equilibrium-ﬁnding,\nopponent modeling, human-computer interactive learning, and\nonline exploiting sub-optimal opponents.\nII. RELATED WORK\nStandard benchmarks have played an indispensable role\nin promoting the research in many AI tasks like speech\nrecognition, computer vision, and natural language process-\ning. For example, in the task of speech to text, the NIST\nSwitchboard benchmark [25] helps reduce the word error rate\nfrom 19.3% in 2000 to 5.5% in 2017; In the task of image\nclassiﬁcation, the creation of the ImageNet [26] benchmark\nhas helped in the development of highly efﬁcient models\nwhich reduce the image classiﬁcation error rate from 26.2%\ndown to 1.8%; In the task of machine translation, the WMT\nbenchmark helps the machine translation system achieves\nhuman-level performance on the Chinese to English translation\ntask [27]. These benchmarks that have greatly inﬂuenced\nthe research communities have some common characteristics:\nclear evaluation metrics, rich baseline models, and convenient\nonline testing platforms. Motivated by this, we propose the\nOpenHoldem benchmark that meets the above requirements to\nfacilitate the future development of general-purpose techniques\nfor large-scale imperfect-information games.\nThere are already some benchmarks on game AI. Examples\ninclude the Atari environments in OpenAI Gym [28], ViZ-\nDoom [29], and MineRL [30], but most of these benchmarks\nare oriented towards the research of reinforcement learning\nalgorithms. Recently, some benchmarks for game theory re-\nsearch have been proposed. For example, Google DeepMind\nreleases the OpenSpiel [31] benchmark, which contains a\ncollection of environments and algorithms for research in n-\nplayer zero-sum and general-sum games. Although OpenSpiel\nimplements many different kinds of games and state-of-the-\nart algorithms, it currently does not provide high-performance\nNLTH AIs. RLCard [32] developed by the Texas A&M\nUniversity includes many large-scale complex card games,\nsuch as Dou dizhu, Mahjong, UNO, Sheng Ji, and NLTH.\nHowever, most of the implemented baseline AIs are relatively\nweak. In contrast, the proposed OpenHoldem contains very\nstrong baseline AIs, which can serve as a better starting point\nfor future improvements.\nTexas Hold’em, the primary testbed for imperfect informa-\ntion game research, has been studied in the computer poker\ncommunity for years [19]. The earliest Texas Hold’em AIs\nare rule-based systems that consist of a collection of if-then\nrules written by human experts. For example, the early agents\n(e.g., Loki [33]) produced by the University of Alberta are\nmostly based on carefully designed rules. While the rule-\nbased approach provides a simple framework for implementing\nTexas Hold’em AIs, the resulting handcrafted strategies are\neasily exploitable by observant opponents. Since 2006, the\nAnnual Computer Poker Competition (ACPC) [34] has greatly\nfacilitated poker AI development, and many game-theoretic\nTexas Hold’em AIs are proposed [21], [22]. These systems\nﬁrst use various abstraction strategies [35], [36] to merge\nsimilar game states to reduce the game size, then exploit some\nequilibrium-ﬁnding algorithms (e.g., CFR [23] and its various\nvariants [37]–[40]) to ﬁnd the approximate Nash equilibrium\nstrategies which are robust to different opponents.\nRecently, the research on these game-theoretic approaches\nhas made signiﬁcant breakthroughs. Examples include Deep-\nStack [16] proposed by the University of Alberta that defeats\nprofessional poker players by a large margin, Libratus [17]\nfrom the Carnegie Mellon University that decisively defeats\nfour top HUNL-specialist professionals, and Pluribus [24]\nas a direct descendant of Libratus that defeats elite human\nprofessional players in six-player NLTH. Nevertheless, almost\nall of these Texas Hold’em AIs are not publicly available,\nmaking it very challenging for new researchers to study this\nproblem further. Our OpenHoldem is the ﬁrst open benchmark\nwith publicly available strong baseline AIs for large-scale\nimperfect-information game research.\nIII. PRELIMINARIES\nHere we present some background knowledge needed for\nthe rest of the paper. We ﬁrst provide some notations to\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XX 2021\n3\nformulate imperfect-information games. Next, we discuss the\nCFR algorithm which is the most commonly used equilibrium-\nﬁnding algorithm for imperfect-information games. Finally, we\nintroduce the game rule of no-limit Texas Hold’em.\nA. Imperfect-Information Games\nImperfect-information games are usually described by a\ntree-based formalism called extensive-form games [41]. In an\nimperfect-information extensive-form game G there is a ﬁnite\nset N = {1,. . ., N} of players, and there is also a special\nplayer c called chance; H refers to a ﬁnite set of histories,\neach member h ∈H denotes a possible history (or state),\nwhich consists of actions taken by players including chance;\ng ⊑h denotes the fact that g is equal to or a preﬁx of h;\nZ ⊆H denotes the terminal states and any member z ∈Z is\nnot a preﬁx of any other states; A(h) = {a : ha ∈H} is the\nset of available actions in the non-terminal state h ∈H \\ Z;\nA player function P : H \\ Z →N ∪{c} assigns a member\nof N ∪{c} to each non-terminal state in H \\ Z, i.e., P(h) is\nthe player who takes an action in state h.\nFor a state set {h ∈H : P(h) = i}, Ii denotes an infor-\nmation partition of player i; A set Ii ∈Ii is an information\nset of player i and I(h) represents the information set which\ncontains the state h. If g and h belong to the same information\nset Ii, then the player i cannot distinguish between them,\nso we can deﬁne A(Ii) = A(h) and P(Ii) = P(h) for\narbitrary h ∈Ii. We deﬁne |I| = maxi∈N |Ii| and |A| =\nmaxi∈N maxIi∈Ii |A(Ii)|. For each player i ∈N, a utility\nfunction ui(z) deﬁne the payoff received by player i upon\nreaching a terminal state z. ∆i is the range of payoffs reach-\nable by player i, i.e., ∆i = maxz∈Z ui(z) −minz∈Z ui(z)\nand ∆= maxi∈N ∆i.\nA strategy proﬁle σ = {σi|σi ∈Σi, i ∈N} is a\nspeciﬁcation of strategies for all players, where Σi is the\nset of all possible strategies for player i, and σ−i refers to\nthe strategies of all players other than player i. For each\nplayer i ∈N, its strategy σi assigns a distribution over\nA(Ii) to each information set Ii of player i. The strategy\nof the chance player σc is usually a ﬁxed probability dis-\ntribution. σi(a|h) denotes the probability of action a taken\nby player i ∈N at state h. In imperfect information games,\n∀h1, h2 ∈Ii, we have σi(Ii) = σi(h1) = σi(h2). The\nstate reach probability of h is denoted by πσ(h) if all\nplayers take actions according to the strategy proﬁle σ. The\nstate reach probability can be composed into each player’s\ncontribution, i.e., πσ(h) = Q\ni∈N∪{c} πσ\ni (h) = πσ\ni (h)πσ\n−i(h),\nwhere πσ\ni (h) = Q\nh′a⊑h,P(h′)=i σi(a|h′) is player i′s con-\ntribution and πσ\n−i(h) = Q\nh′a⊑h,P(h′)̸=i σP(h′)(a|h′) is all\nplayers’ contribution except player i. The information set\nreach probability of Ii is deﬁned as πσ(Ii) = P\nh∈Ii πσ(h).\nThe interval state reach probability from state h′ to h is\ndeﬁned as πσ(h′, h) = πσ(h)\/πσ(h′) if h′ ⊑h. πσ\ni (Ii),\nπσ\n−i(Ii), πσ\ni (h′, h), and πσ\n−i(h′, h) are deﬁned similarly.\nFor each player i ∈N, the expected utility uσ\ni\n=\nP\nz∈Z πσ(z)ui(z) under a strategy proﬁle σ is the expected\npayoff of player i obtained at all possible terminal states.\nThe best response to the strategy proﬁle σ−i is any strategy\nσ∗\ni of player i that achieves optimal payoff against σ−i, i.e.,\nσ∗\ni = arg maxσ′\ni∈Σi u(σ′\ni,σ−i)\ni\n. For the two-player zero-sum\ngames, i.e., N = {1, 2} and ∀z ∈Z, u1(z) + u2(z) = 0,\nthe Nash equilibrium is the most commonly used solution\nconcept which is a strategy proﬁle σ∗= (σ∗\n1, σ∗\n2) such that\neach player’s strategy is the best response to the other. An\nϵ-Nash equilibrium is an approximate Nash equilibrium,\nwhose strategy proﬁle σ satisﬁes: ∀i ∈N, uσ\ni + ϵ ≥\nmaxσ′\ni∈Σi u(σ′\ni,σ−i)\ni\n. The exploitability of a strategy σi is\ndeﬁned as ϵi(σi) = uσ∗\ni −u\n(σi,σ∗\n−i)\ni\n. A strategy is unexploitable\nif ϵi(σi) = 0.\nB. Counterfactual Regret Minimization\nCounterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) [23] is an iter-\native algorithm for computing approximate Nash equilibrium\nin imperfect-information games and is widely used in NLTH\nAI. CFR frequently uses counterfactual value, which is the\nexpected payoff of an information set given that player i\ntries to reach it. Formally, for player i at an information\nset I ∈Ii given a strategy proﬁle σ, the counterfactual\nvalue of I is vσ\ni (I) = P\nh∈I(πσ\n−i(h) P\nz∈Z(πσ(h, z)ui(z)).\nThe counterfactual value of an action a in I is vσ\ni (a|I) =\nP\nh∈I(πσ\n−i(h) P\nz∈Z(πσ(ha, z)ui(z)).\nCFR typically starts with a random strategy σ1. On each\niteration T, CFR ﬁrst recursively traverses the game tree using\nthe strategy σT to calculate the instantaneous regret rT\ni (a|I)\nof not choosing action a in an information set I for player i,\ni.e., rT\ni (a|T) = vσT\ni\n(a|I) −vσT\ni\n(I). Then CFR accumulates\nthe instantaneous regret to obtain the cumulative regret\nRT\ni (a|I) = PT\nt=1 rt\ni(a|I) and uses regret-matching [42] to\ncalculate the new strategy for the next iteration:\nσT +1\ni\n(a|I) =\n\n\n\nRT,+\ni\n(a|I)\nP\na′∈A(I) RT,+\ni\n(a′|I),\nP\na′ RT,+\ni\n(a′|I) > 0\n1\n|A(I)|,\notherwise\n(1)\nwhere RT,+\ni\n(a|I) = max(RT\ni (a|I), 0).\nIn two-player zero-sum imperfect-information games, if\nboth players play according to CFR on each iteration then their\naverage strategies ¯σT converge to an ϵ-Nash equilibrium in\nO(|I|2|A|∆2\/ϵ2) iterations [23]. ¯σT is calculated as:\nST\ni (a|I)=\nT\nX\nt=1\n\u0010\nπσt\ni\n(I)σt\ni(a|I)\n\u0011\n, ¯σT\ni (a|I)=\nST\ni (a|I)\nP\na′∈A(I) ST\ni (a′|T ) .\n(2)\nThus, CFR is a ready-to-use equilibrium ﬁnding algorithm in\ntwo-player zero-sum games.\nC. No-limit Texas Hold’em\nNo-limit Texas hold’em (NLTH) has been the most widely\nplayed type of poker for more than a decade. The heads-\nup (i.e., two-player) variant prevents opponent collusion and\nallows a clear winner to be determined, so heads-up no-limit\nTexas hold’em (HUNL) becomes the primary testbed in the\ncomputer poker and game theory communities. HUNL is a\nrepeated game in which the two players play a match of\nindividual games, usually called hands. On each hand, one\nplayer will win some number of chips from the other player,\nand the goal is to win as many chips as possible throughout the\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XX 2021\n4\nmatch. In this paper, we follow the standard form of HUNL\npoker agreed upon by the research community [34], where\neach player starts each hand with a stack of $20,000 chips.\nResetting the stacks after each hand allows for each hand to\nbe an independent sample of the same game and is called\n“Doyle’s Game”, named for the professional poker player\nDoyle Brunson who publicized this variant.\nHUNL consists of four rounds of betting. On each round of\nbetting, each player can choose to either fold, call, or raise. If\na player folds, the game will end with no player revealing their\nprivate cards, and the opponent will take the pot. If a player\ncalls, he or she places several chips in the pot by matching the\namount of chips entered by the opponent. If a player raises by\nx, he or she adds x more chips to the pot than the opponent.\nA raise of all remaining chips is called an all in bet. A betting\nround ends if each player has taken actions and has entered\nthe same amount of chips in the pot as every other player still\nin the hand. At the beginning of a round, when there are no\nopponent chips yet to match, the raise action is called bet, and\nthe call action is called check. If either player chooses to raise\nﬁrst in a round, they must raise a minimum of $100 chips. If a\nplayer raises after another player has raised, that raise must be\ngreater than or equal to the last raise. The maximum amount\nfor a bet or raise is the remainder of that player’s stack, which\nis $20,000 at the beginning of a hand.\nIn HUNL, at the beginning of each hand, the ﬁrst player,\ni.e., P1, enters a big blind (usually $100) into the pot; the\nsecond player, i.e., P2, enters a small blind which is generally\nhalf the size of the big blind; and both players are then dealt\nwith two hole (private) cards from a standard 52-card deck.\nThere is then the ﬁrst round of betting (called the pre-ﬂop),\nwhere the second player P2 acts ﬁrst. The players alternate\nin choosing to fold, call or raise. After the pre-ﬂop, three\ncommunity (public) cards are dealt face up for all players to\nobserve, and the ﬁrst player P1 now starts a similar round of\nbetting (called the ﬂop) to the ﬁrst round. After the ﬂop round\nends, another community card is dealt face up, and the third\nround of betting (called the turn) commences where P1 acts\nﬁrst. Finally, a ﬁfth community card is dealt face up, and a\nfourth betting round (called the river) occurs, again with P1\nacting ﬁrst. If none of the players folds at the end of the fourth\nround, the game enters a show-down process: the private cards\nare revealed, the player with the best ﬁve-card poker hand (see\nFigure 1 for the hand strength), constructed from the player’s\ntwo private cards and the ﬁve community cards, wins the pot.\nIn the case of a tie, the pot is split equally among the players.\nFor a better understanding of these rounds, Figure 2 provides\na visualized example of the four rounds in one HUNL game.\nA match consists of a large number of poker hands, in which\nthe players alternate their positions as the ﬁrst and the second\nplayer. The rules of Six-player NLTH and HUNL are roughly\nthe same. For the detailed rules of Six-player NLTH, please\nrefer to the supplementary materials of [24].\nSince NLTH can be played for different stakes, such as\na big blind being worth $0.01 or $1000, it is inappropriate\nto measure the performance by chips, so players commonly\nmeasure their performance over a match as their average\nnumber of big blinds won per hand.

For example, a player that always folds will\nlose 750 mbb\/h (by losing 1000 mbb as the big blind and 500\nas the small blind).\nIV. OPENHOLDEM\nAs shown in Figure 3, the proposed OpenHoldem bench-\nmark for large-scale imperfect information game research\nconsists of three parts: the evaluation protocols, the baseline\nAIs, and an online testing platform. Next, we will expatiate\nthese three parts respectively.\nA. Evaluation Protocols\nEvaluating the performance of different NLTH agents is\nchallenging due to the inherent variance present in the game.\nA better agent may lose in a short period simply because it\nwas dealt with weaker cards. Moreover, different papers use\ndifferent evaluation metrics, making comparisons of different\nmethods difﬁcult. In OpenHoldem, we propose using the\nfollowing evaluation metrics to test different algorithms from\ndifferent aspects thoroughly.\n1) Head-to-Head Based Evaluation Metrics: One of the\nmain goals of agent evaluation is to estimate the expected\nutility uσ\ni of some player i ∈N given a strategy proﬁle σ. If\nthe game is small, one can compute this expectation exactly by\nenumerating all terminal states, i.e., uσ\ni = P\nz∈Z πσ(z)ui(z).\nIn the large-scale NLTH, however, this approach is unpractical.\nThe most commonly used approach to approximately estimate\nuσ\ni is sampling. Speciﬁcally, the NLTH agents repeatedly play\nagainst each other, drawing independent samples z1, . . . , zT\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. XX, NO.

OpenHoldem provides an integrated toolkit for large-scale imperfect-\ninformation game research using NLTH with three main components: the\nevaluation protocols, the baseline NLTH AIs, and an online testing platform.\nwith the probability πσ(z). The estimator ˆuσ\ni is simply the\naverage utility,\nˆuσ\ni = 1\nT\nT\nX\nt=1\nui(zt).\n(3)\nThis estimator is unbiased, i.e., E[ˆuσ\ni ] = uσ\ni , so the mean-\nsquared-error (MSE) of ˆuσ\ni is its variance,\nMSE(ˆuσ\ni ) = Var[ˆuσ\ni ] = 1\nT Var[ui(z)].\n(4)\nThis sampling based approach is effective when the domain\nhas little stochasticity, i.e., Var[ui(z)] is small, but this is not\nthe case in NLTH. To alleviate the effects of randomness and\nensure statistically signiﬁcant results, we propose to use the\nfollowing two variance reduction techniques in head-to-head\nbased evaluation.\nDuplicate Poker is a simple variance reduction technique\nthat attempts to mitigate the effects of luck and is widely used\nin the Annual Computer Poker Competitions (ACPC) [34]. For\nexample, in HUNL, let us say agent A plays one seat and agent\nB plays the other seat. First, we let A and B play M hands of\npoker, then we switch their seats and play another M hands\nof poker with the same set of cards for each seat. By doing\nso, if agent A is dealt two aces in the ﬁrst hand, then agent\nB will be dealt two aces in the M + 1-th hand, so the effects\nof luck are signiﬁcantly alleviated. The process of duplicate\npoker for multiplayer NLTH is similar.\nAIVAT is a more principled variance reduction technique\nfor evaluating performance of agents in imperfect-information\ngames [43]. The core idea of AIVAT is to derive a real-valued\nfunction ˜ui that is used in place of the true utility function ui.\nOn one hand, the expectation of ˜ui(z) matches that of ui(z)\nfor any choice of strategy proﬁle σ, so ˜uσ\ni = 1\nT\nPT\nt=1 ˜ui(zt)\nis also an unbiased estimator of the expected utility uσ\ni . On\nthe other hand, the variance of ˜ui(z) is designed to be smaller\nthan that of ui(z), so MSE(˜uσ\ni ) < MSE(ˆuσ\ni ), i.e., ˜uσ\ni is a\nbetter estimator than ˆuσ\ni . More speciﬁcally, AIVAT adds a\ncarefully designed control variate term for both chance actions\nand actions of players with known strategies, resulting in a\nprovably unbiased low-variance evaluation tool for imperfect-\ninformation games. It is worth noting that duplicate poker and\nAIVAT can be combined to further reduce the variance.\n2) Exploitability Based Evaluation Metrics: Most works on\ncomputer poker are to approximate a Nash equilibrium, i.e.,\nproduce a low-exploitability strategy. However, head-to-head\nevaluation has been shown to be a poor equilibrium approxi-\nmation quality estimator in imperfect-information games [16].\nFor example, in the toy game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, consider\nthe exact Nash equilibrium strategy (i.e., playing each option\nwith equal probability) playing against a dummy strategy that\nalways plays “rock”. The head-to-head based evaluation results\nare a tie in this example, but the two strategies are vastly\ndifferent in terms of exploitability. Therefore, the exploitability\nis also a crucial evaluation metric in imperfect-information\ngames. The exploitability of one strategy can be measured\nby calculating its best-response strategy, but the large size\nof NLTH’s game tree makes an explicit best-response com-\nputation intractable. We propose to use the following two\ntechniques to calculate the exploitability approximately.\nLocal Best Response (LBR) is a simple and computation-\nally inexpensive method to ﬁnd a lower-bound on a strategy’s\nexploitability [44]. The most important concept in this algo-\nrithm is the agent’s range, i.e., the probability distribution on\neach of the possible private cards the agent holds. Suppose\nwe want to ﬁnd the LBR of the agent A with known strategy\nσa. At the beginning of each poker hand, it is equally likely\nthat A holds any pair of private cards. The probabilities of\nactions performed by A depend on the private cards it holds.\nKnowing the strategy of A, we can use Bayes’ theorem to\ninfer the probabilities that A holds each of the private cards.\nBased on the range of A, LBR greedily approximates the\nbest response actions, i.e., the actions which maximize the\nexpected utility under the assumption that the game will be\nchecked\/called until the end. Thus, LBR best-responds locally\nto the opponent’s actions by looking only at one action ahead,\nproviding a lower bound on the opponent’s exploitability.\nLBR also relies on playing standard poker hands, so the\nvariance reduction techniques (e.g., AIVAT) can be exploited\nto reduce the number of hands required to produce statistically\nsigniﬁcant results.\nDeep Reinforcement Learning Based Best Response\n(DRL-BR). Because the game tree of NLTH is too large, the\nLBR algorithm does not explicitly compute a best-response\nstrategy but uses its local approximation to play against the\nevaluated agent A directly. In DRL-BR, we try to explicitly\napproximate the best response strategy by training an DRL\nagent B against A. More speciﬁcally, by treating A as part\nof the environment, then from the perspective of B, the\nenvironment can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP). B can leverage some suitable DRL algorithms (e.g.,\nDQN [5], PPO [45], etc.) to learn to maximize its payoff\nfrom its experience of interacting with the environment, i.e.,\nplaying against A. This approach turns the problem of ﬁnding\nthe best response strategy into a single agent RL problem. An\napproximate solution of the MDP by RL yields an approximate\nbest response to the evaluated agent A. After obtaining the ap-\nproximate best response B, the head-to-head evaluation result\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XX 2021\n6\n(e.g., AIVAT) can be used to approximate the exploitability of\nA by having them repeatedly play against each other.\nB. Baseline AIs\nDespite signiﬁcant progress in designing NLTH AIs in\nrecent years, almost all of these AIs are not publicly available.\nThis situation makes it very challenging for new researchers to\nfurther study this problem since designing and implementing\na decent NLTH AI is often very complicated and tedious. To\nﬁll this gap, in OpenHoldem, we design and implement four\ndifferent types of NLTH AIs, which are strong enough to serve\nas a good starting point for future research in this area.\n1) Rule Based AI: The rule-based method is probably the\nmost straightforward way to implement NLTH AI. A rule-\nbased NLTH AI consists of a collection of rules designed by\ndomain experts. In OpenHoldem, we develop AR, a strong\nrule-based NLTH AI designed by some skilled Texas Hold’em\nplayers in our research group. Our rule-based AI AR handles\nabout 106 different scenarios that are likely to occur in the\nreal play of NLTH and contains tens of thousands of lines of\ncode. As a suggestion, when researchers implement their own\nNLTH AIs, it is useful to compare them to our rule-based AI\nAR as a sanity check.\nBesides the strong rule-based AI AR, we also designed\nsome other rule-based AIs with different styles and strengths\n(Table I). These agents can be used as learning materials\nfor beginners, and more importantly, they can also help re-\nsearchers to carry out research on opponent modeling. These\nrule-based AIs calculate the expected winning probability at\neach stage, and then make decisions based on these probabil-\nities and different predeﬁned rules.\n2) CFR Based Static AI: While the rule-based approach\nprovides a simple framework for implementing NLTH AIs,\nthe resulting strategies are exploitable. Therefore, most recent\nstudies in NLTH AIs are focused on approximating the the-\noretically unexploitable Nash equilibrium strategies. Among\nthem, the most successful approach is the CFR algorithm [23]\nand its various variants [38], [39], [46]. CFR type algorithms\niteratively minimizes the regrets of both players so that\nthe time-averaged strategy gradually approximates the Nash\nequilibrium. In OpenHoldem, we design and implement AC,\na strong CFR based NLTH AI, which aims to serve as a\nstarting point for the large-scale equilibrium-ﬁnding research.\nOverall, AC ﬁrst uses the abstraction algorithm to create a\nsmaller abstract game, then approximates the Nash equilibrium\nstrategy in this abstract game, and ﬁnally executes the resulting\nstrategy in the original game.\nThe abstraction algorithm aims to take a large-scale imper-\nfect information game as input and output a smaller but strate-\ngically similar game that is solvable by current equilibrium-\nﬁnding algorithms. It usually consists of two parts, information\nabstraction and action abstraction. In AC, we use the potential-\naware information abstraction algorithm [36], which uses the\nk-means algorithm with the earth mover’s distance metric to\ncluster cards with similar potential. Action abstraction further\nreduces the size of the game tree by restricting the available\nactions, which is especially important in games with large\nAlgorithm 1 The CFR+ algorithm which is used to train AC.\nInput: The abstract game G, the randomly initialized strategy\nproﬁle σ1, the zero initialized cumulative regret R0 and\ncumulative strategy S0.\nParameter: The number of iterations T.\nOutput: The approximate Nash equilibrium ¯σT = {¯σT\n1 , ¯σT\n2 }.\n1: for t = 1 →T do\n2:\nfor i = 1 →2 do\n3:\nvσt\ni (h) = P\nh⊑z,z∈Z πσt\n−i(h)πσt(h, z)ui(z)\n4:\nvσt\ni (a|h) = vσt\ni (ha)\n5:\nvσt\ni (Ii) = P\nh∈Ii vσt\ni (h)\n6:\nvσt\ni (a|Ii) = P\nh∈Ii vσt\ni (ha)\n7:\nrσt\ni (a|Ii) = vσt\ni (a|Ii) −vσt\ni (Ii)\n8:\nRt\ni(a|Ii) = max(0, Rt−1\ni\n(a|Ii) + rσt\ni (a|Ii))\n9:\nσt+1\ni\n(a|Ii) = Rt\ni(a|Ii)\/P\na∈A(Ii) Rt\ni(a|Ii)\n10:\nSt\ni(a|Ii) = St−1\ni\n(a|Ii) + πσt\ni (Ii)σt\ni(a|Ii)\n11:\nend for\n12: end for\n13: ¯σiT (a|Ii) = ST\ni (a|Ii)\/P\na∈A(Ii) ST\ni (a|Ii)\naction spaces, such as NLTH. In AC, we restrict the actions\nto Fold, Call\/Check, Bet Half Pot, Bet Pot, and All-In.\nAfter obtaining the manageable abstract game G, we use\nthe iterative CFR+ [38] algorithm to approximating the Nash\nequilibrium in G. As shown in Algorithm 1, given the current\nstrategy proﬁle σt, we ﬁrst calculate the cumulative regret of\neach action after t iterations in Line 8. Then, the new strategy\nin the t + 1-th iteration is updated in Line 9 by the regret-\nmatching algorithm. Finally, by normalizing the cumulative\nstrategy ST in Line 13, the average strategy ¯σT will approach\na Nash equilibrium when T is large enough. During the actual\nplay phase, AC ﬁrst ﬁnds the abstract state that corresponds\nto the current real state of the game. Then, the approximate\nNash equilibrium ¯σT of the abstract game is queried for\nthe probability distribution over different actions. Finally, an\naction is sampled from this distribution and played in the\nactual game, if applicable.\n3) DeepStack-Like Online AI: In essence, the AC agent is\na static table calculated ofﬂine that contains the probability\ndistributions over possible actions in all situations. During\nactual play, if the opponent chooses an action that is not\nin the action abstraction of AC, i.e., an off-tree action, AC\nround this off-tree action to a nearby in-abstraction action.\nA more principled approach to calculate the off-tree action’s\nresponse is by solving a subgame that immediately follows\nthat off-tree action. DeepStack [16] is a representative online\nalgorithm based on this idea. In particular, DeepStack allows\ncomputation to be focused on speciﬁc situations raised when\nmaking decisions using a sound local strategy computation\nalgorithm called continual re-solving. To make continual re-\nsolving computationally tractable, DeepStack replaces sub-\ntrees beyond a certain depth with a learned value function\nbased on deep neural network.\nThe authors of DeepStack [16] does not release the training\ncode or model for NLTH. They only release a pedagogical\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. XX, NO.

Speciﬁcally, we spend several weeks using\n120 GPUs to generate millions of training samples for the\nriver, turn, and ﬂop value networks. Each training sample\nis generated by running 1000 CFR+ iterations based on a\nrandom reach probability. Since generating these training data\nrequires huge computing resources, we will provide download\nlinks for these training data later. Everyone can freely use\nthese data for research. It is worth noting that Noam Brown,\nthe creator of Libratus, recently co-authored a paper [47], in\nwhich they also reimplemented DeepStack. AD has achieved\nsimilar results to theirs, which validates the correctness of our\nreimplementation.\n4) Deep Reinforcement Learning Based AI:\nThe three\nagents, i.e., the rule-based AI AR, the CFR based static\nAI AC, and the DeepStack-like online AI AD, described\nin the previous sections are all based on improvements of\nexisting techniques. These AIs often rely on different kinds\nof NLTH domain knowledge, such as expert rules in AR\nand handcrafted abstraction algorithms in AC. Besides, there\nare also computational issues, i.e., in the inference stage of\nAD, the CFR iteration process consumes much computation.\nSpeciﬁcally, to ensure AD’s high-quality prediction, this itera-\ntion process often needs to be carried out for more than 1,000\ntimes in practice.\nBased on the above considerations, in OpenHoldem, we\nfurther propose a high-performance and lightweight NLTH AI,\ni.e., ARL, obtained with an end-to-end deep reinforcement\nlearning framework. ARL adopts a pseudo-Siamese archi-\ntecture to directly learn from the input state information to\nthe output actions by competing the learned model with its\ndifferent historical versions. The main technical contributions\nof ARL include a novel state representation of card and betting\ninformation, a novel reinforcement learning loss function, and\na new self-play procedure to generate the ﬁnal model.

During\ninference, ARL takes only 3.8×10−3 second for each decision\nin a single-core CPU of 2.00GHz. ARL is the ﬁrst AI that\nobtains competitive performance in NLTH solely through RL.\na) The Overall Architecture: ARL aims to remove the\nexpensive computation of CFR iteration in both the training\nand testing stages of a NLTH AI while eliminating the need\nof domain knowledge. It thus pursues an end-to-end learning\nframework to perform efﬁcient and effective decision-making\nin imperfect-information games. Here end-to-end means that\nthe framework directly accepts the game board information\nand outputs the actions without encoding handcrafted features\nas inputs or performing iterative reasoning in the decision\nprocess. ARL adopts the RL framework to achieve this goal,\nand the only force to drive the model to learn is the reward.\nIn NLTH, the game board information includes the current\nand historical card information and the player action informa-\ntion. The agent chooses from a set of betting actions to play the\ngame and try to win more rewards. To capture the complex\nrelationship among the game board information, the desired\nbetting actions, and the game rewards, we design a pseudo-\nSiamese architecture equipped with the RL schema to learn\nthe underlying relationships from end to end. We illustrate the\nend-to-end learning architecture of ARL in Figure 4.\nAs shown in Figure 4, the input of the architecture is the\ngame state representations of action and card information,\nwhich are respectively sent to the top and bottom streams\nof the Siamese architecture.

To train ARL, we present a novel Trinal-Clip loss\nfunction to update the model parameters using RL algorithms.\nWe obtain the ﬁnal model through a new self-play procedure\nthat plays the current model with a pool of its K best historical\nversions to sample diverse training data from the huge game\nstate space. We believe these new techniques and underlying\nprinciples are helpful to develop general learning algorithms\nfor more imperfect-information games.\nb) Effective Game State Representation: The existence of\nprivate information and ﬂexibility of bet size cause the NLTH\nAI learning extremely challenging. To obtain an effective and\nsuitable feature representation for end-to-end learning from\nthe game state directly to the desired action, we design a new\nmulti-dimensional feature representation to encode both the\ncurrent and historical card and bet information.\nIn NLTH, the card and action information exhibit different\ncharacteristics. We thus represent them as two separated three-\ndimension tensors and let the network learn to fuse them\n(Figure 4). We design the card tensor in six channels to\nrepresent the agent’s two private cards, three ﬂop cards, one\nturn card, one river card, all public cards, and all private and\npublic cards. Each channel is a 4 × 13 sparse binary matrix,\nwith 1 in each position denoting the corresponding card. For\nthe action tensor, since there are usually at most six sequential\nactions in each of the four rounds, we design it in 24 channels.\nEach channel is a 4×nb sparse binary matrix, where nb is the\nnumber of betting options, and the four dimensions correspond\nto the ﬁrst player’s action, the second player’s action, the sum\nof two player’s action, and the legal actions. To understand this\nrepresentation, Figure 5 illustrates one example that a player\nin the small blind plays an action ‘bet pot’ after getting a hand\n‘AsAc’.\nThis representation has several advantages: 1) there is no\nabstraction of the card information thus reserves all the game\ninformation; 2) the action representation is general and can\ndenote different number of betting options (though nb = 9\nproduce satisfactory results in the experiment); 3) all the\nhistorical information is encoded to aid reasoning with hidden\ninformation; and 4) the multi-dimensional tensor representa-\ntion is very suitable for modern deep neural architectures like\nResNet [48] to learn effective feature hierarchies, as veriﬁed\nin the AlphaGo AI training.\nc) Effective Learning with Trinal-Clip PPO: With the\nmulti-dimensional feature representation, a natural choice is\nto use the current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algo-\nrithms such as PPO [45] to train the deep architecture. PPO\nis an actor-critic framework which trains a value function\nVθ(st) and a policy πθ(at|st). PPO deﬁnes a ratio function\nrt(θ) =\nπθ(at|st)\nπθ′(at|st) as the ratio between the current policy πθ\nand the old policy πθ′, and a policy loss function Lp as:\nLp(θ) = Et\nh\nmin\n\u0010\nrt(θ) ˆAt, clip (rt(θ), 1 −ϵ, 1 + ϵ) ˆAt\n\u0011i\n,\n(5)\nwhere ˆ\nAt is the advantage function, clip(rt(θ), 1 −ϵ, 1 + ϵ)\nensures rt lie in the interval (1−ϵ, 1+ϵ), and ϵ is a clip ratio\nhyper-parameter with typical value 0.2. PPO’s value loss Lv\nis deﬁned as:\nLv(θ) = Et\nh\n(Rγ\nt −Vθ(st))2i\n,\n(6)\nin which Rγ\nt represents the traditional γ-return [49].\nHowever, the above PPO loss function is difﬁcult to con-\nverge for NLTH AI training. We ﬁnd two main reasons for this\nproblem: 1) when πθ(at|st) ≫πθ′(at|st) and the advantage\nfunction ˆ\nAt<0, the policy loss Lp(θ) will introduce a large\nvariance; 2) due to the strong randomness of NLTH, the value\nloss Lv(θ) is often too large. To speed up and stabilize the\ntraining process, we design a Trinal-Clip PPO loss function. It\nintroduces one more clipping hyper-parameter δ1 for the policy\nloss when ˆ\nAt<0, and two more clipping hyper-parameters δ2\nand δ3 for the value loss. The policy loss function Ltcp for\nTrinal-Clip PPO is deﬁned as:\nLtcp(θ)=Et\nh\nclip (rt(θ), clip (rt(θ), 1−ϵ, 1+ϵ), δ1) ˆAt\ni\n,\n(7)\nwhere δ1 > 1+ϵ, and ϵ is the original clip in PPO. The clipped\nvalue loss function Ltcv for Trinal-Clip PPO is deﬁned as:\nLtcv(θ) = Et\nh\n(clip (Rγ\nt , −δ2, δ3) −Vθ(st))2i\n,\n(8)\nwhere δ2 and δ3 do not require manual tuning but represent\nthe total number of chips the player and the opponent has\nplaced, respectively. −δ2 represent the state value when the\nplayer folds, similarly, δ3 is the state value when the opponent\nfolds. This value-clip loss signiﬁcantly reduces the variance\nduring the training process. Our proposed Trinal-Clip PPO\nloss function improves the learning effectiveness of the actor-\ncritic framework, and we believe it is applicable for a wide\nrange of RL applications with imperfect information.\nd) Efﬁcient Self-Play Procedure:\nWith the proposed\nTrinal-Clip PPO loss function, the most direct way is using the\nself-play algorithm [50] to train the NLTH agent. However,\ndue to the private information in NLTH, simple self-play\nlearning designed for perfect information games [6], [8] often\ncauses the agent trapped in a local minimum and defeated\nby agents with counter-strategies. AlphaStar [11] designs a\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XX 2021\n9\npopulation-based training (PBT) procedure to maintain multi-\nple self-play agents and obtains excellent results in the real-\ntime strategy game StarCraft II. However, the PBT procedure\nneeds a tremendous computational resource to ensure good\nperformance.\nTo obtain a high-performance NLTH AI with both low\ncomputation cost and strong decision-making ability, we pro-\npose a new type of self-play algorithm which trains only one\nagent but learns strong and diverse policies. The proposed\nalgorithm maintains a pool of competing agents from the\nhistorical versions of the main agent. Then, by competing\namong different agents, the algorithm selects the K best\nsurvivors from their ELO [11] scores and generates training\ndata simultaneously. The main agent learns from the data\nand thus can compete with different opponents, maintaining a\nstrong decision-making ability of high-ﬂexible policies. Since\nthe proposed algorithm performs self-play among the main\nagent and its K best historical versions, we refer to it as K-\nBest Self-Play. Our proposed K-Best Self-Play inherits PBT’s\nmerit of diverse policy styles while maintains computational\nefﬁciency of single-thread agent training, striking a good\nbalance between efﬁciency and effectiveness.\nC. Online Testing Platform\nIn order to make the comparisons between different NLTH\nAIs easier, we develop an online testing platform with the\nabove four strong baseline AIs, i.e., AR, AC, AD and ARL\nbuilt-in. Researchers can compare the performances between\ntheir own AIs and the built-in baselines through easy-to-use\nAPIs. Figure 6 shows an example Python code of connecting\nto the platform for testing NLTH AIs. The NLTH AI designers\nonly need to implement one function, i.e., act, without caring\nabout the internal structure of the platform. The input of act\nis the current game state, which is obtained from the platform\nthrough TCP sockets. The output of act is the action to take in\nthe current game state according to the designer’s algorithm.\nThe output action is also sent to the platform through TCP\nsockets. Figure 7 shows the system architecture of our testing\nplatform. The server is responsible for playing the poker\nhands according to the rules of NLTH. It also dynamically\nschedules requests and allocates resources when necessary.\nOur platform not only supports testing between different AIs,\nbut also between humans and AIs.\nWe are more than happy to accept high-performance AIs\nsubmitted by everyone to continuously enrich the baseline\nAIs of OpenHoldem, with the ultimate goal of providing an\nNLTH AI Zoo for the research community. Currently, there\nare dozens of NLTH AI researchers and developers are using\nthis platform. It has accumulated about 20 million high-quality\npoker data and the data increases by about 100,000 per day.\nWe believe that these large-scale data will also facilitate the\nresearch of data-driven imperfect-information game solving,\nimitation learning and opponent modeling algorithms.\nV.

Comparison to the State-of-the-Arts\nTo the best of our knowledge, Slumbot [21], the champion\nof the 2018 Annual Computer Poker Competition (ACPC), is\nthe only publicly available NLTH AI that provides compar-\nisons through an online website2.

Although the performance of the CFR based\nAI AC is not as good as that of Slumbot, its performance is\nalso commendable because Slumbot exploits a far more ﬁne-\ngrained abstraction algorithm. An interesting result is that the\nrule-based AI AR outperforms Slumbot. This result is not\nsurprising, as it has been reported that the abstraction-based\nprograms from the Annual Computer Poker Competition are\nexploitable [44]. These experimental results illustrate that our\nbaseline NLTH AIs are adequate to serving as a good starting\npoint for NLTH AI research.\nThe DeepStack-like AI AD and the RL based AI ARL\nobtain the best performance among the four baselines.

Figure 8 shows the loss curves of the ﬂop\nnetwork during training when x ∈{1, 2, 3}. It is clear that\nthe ﬂop network suffers from severe over-ﬁtting when the\ntraining data size is small, and increasing the training data size\nalleviates this phenomenon.

We ﬁnd that AD:500\n3\nloses 224 mbb to\nSlumbot per hand, while AD:1000\n3\nwins Slumbot 93 mbb per\nhand. These experimental results demonstrate that the number\nof CFR iterations during continual re-solving is critical to the\nperformance of DeepStack-type AI.\nC. Ablation Study on ARL\nTo analyze the effectiveness of each component of the\nRL based AI ARL, we have conducted extensive ablation\nstudies, as shown in Table III. The results of each row are\nobtained by replacing one component of ARL, and the rest\nremains unchanged. All models use the same number of\ntraining samples, and we use ELO scores to compare their\nperformance.\n1) The Effects of Different State Representations: For state\nrepresentation comparison, we consider three alternative meth-\nods: 1) Vectorized state representation like DeepCFR [51]\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL.

Probabilities for not folding as the ﬁrst action for each possible hand. The bottom-left half shows the policy when the suits of two private cards do\nnot match, and the top-right half shows the policy when the suits of two private cards match. Left to right represent the policies of Professional Human, AD,\nand ARL, respectively.\n(Vector). It uses vectors to represent the card information (52-\ndimensional vectors) and the action information (each betting\nposition represented by a binary value specifying whether a\nbet has occurred and a ﬂoat value specifying the bet size); 2)\nPokerCNN-based state representation [52] (PokerCNN) uses\n3D tensors to represent card and action information together\nand use a single ConvNet to learn features; 3) State represen-\ntation without history information (W\/O History Information)\nis similar to ARL except that it does not contain history action\ninformation.\nAs shown in Table III, state representation has a signiﬁcant\nimpact on the ﬁnal performance. PokerCNN performs better\nthan the vectorized state representation Vector, demonstrating\nthat it is more effective to represent state information using\nstructured tensors. ARL outperforms PokerCNN since it uses\na pseudo-Siamese architecture to handle card and action\ninformation separately. ARL is also better than W\/O History\nInformation since historical action information is critical to\ndecision-making in NLTH. ARL obtains the best performance\nthanks to its effective multi-dimensional state representation,\nwhich encodes historical information and is suitable for Con-\nvNets to learn effective feature hierarchies.\n2) The Effects of Different Loss Functions: For the loss\nfunction, we evaluate ARL’s Trinal-Clip PPO loss against two\nkinds of PPO losses: 1) the Original PPO loss [45] (Original\nPPO); 2) the Dual-Clip PPO loss [14] (Dual-Clip PPO). As\nshown in Table III, compared with the Original PPO, Dual-\nClip PPO has a slight performance boost, and Trinal-Clip\nPPO (ARL) obtains the best performance. This performance\nimprovement is mainly because ARL’s policy-clip and value-\nclip loss effectively limit its output to a reasonable range, thus\nensuring the stability of the policy update. In addition, we ﬁnd\nthe model with a small overall loss generally performs better\nafter adding the value-clip loss, which is very convenient for\nmodel selection during training.\n3) The Effects of Different Self-Play Methods: For self-\nplay methods, we compare ARL’s K-Best Self-Play with 1)\nNaive Self-Play [50], which plays with the agent itself; 2) Best-\nWin Self-Play [6], which plays with the best agent in history;\n3) Delta-Uniform Self-Play [53], which plays with the agent\nin the last δ timestamps; and 4) PBT Self-Play [11], which\ntrains multiple agents and play with each other. Interestingly,\ncompared with the more sophisticated Delta-Uniform Self-\nPlay and PBT Self-Play, Naive Self-Play and Best-Win Self-\nPlay achieve better performance, possible because more com-\nplex self-play strategies are more data-hungry. However, the\nperformance of Naive and Best-Win Self-Play are still behind\nK-Best Self-Play, since simplistic self-play methods can not\novercome the notorious cyclical strategy problem in imperfect-\ninformation games. Our K-Best Self-Play method obtains the\nbest performance under the same amount of training data,\nstriking a good balance between efﬁciency and effectiveness.\n4) Exploitability Analysis: We evaluate the exploitability of\nARL with LBR. However, we ﬁnd that LBR fails to exploit\nARL, i.e., LBR loses to ARL by over 335.82 mbb\/h in\n40,000 hands. While this result does not prove that ARL is\nﬂawless, it does demonstrate that ARL seeks to compute and\nplay a low-exploitability strategy. ARL’s low exploitability is\nmainly attributed to its effective state representation, which\nencodes historical information to alleviate the partial observ-\nable problem and its efﬁcient self-play strategy to address the\ngame-theoretic challenges (i.e., cyclical strategy behavior) in\nimperfect-information games.\n5) Visualization of the Learned Policy: To analyze ARL’s\nlearned policy, we compare the action frequencies where the\nagent is the ﬁrst player to act and has no prior state inﬂuencing\nit [47] with those from human professional4 and AD. Figure 10\nshows the policies on how to play the ﬁrst two cards from the\nprofessional human and the two agents. The polices of AD\nand ARL are very similar to those of the human professional,\nwhich further explains their good performance.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we present OpenHoldem, a benchmark for\nlarge-scale imperfect-information game research using NLTH.\nOpenHoldem provides an integrated toolkit with three main\ncomponents: the comprehensive evaluation protocols, the\nstrong baseline NLTH AIs, and an easy-to-use online testing\nplatform. We plan to add more NLTH AIs to OpenHoldem in\nthe future, with the ultimate goal of providing an NLTH AI\nZoo for the research community. We hope OpenHoldem will\nfacilitate further studies on the unsolved theoretical and com-\nputational issues in large-scale imperfect-information games.\n4Obtained from https:\/\/www.wsop.com\/how-to-play-poker\/\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL.

INTRODUCTION\nFrom its inception, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) research has\nbeen focusing on building agents that can play games like\nhumans. Both Turing [1] and Shannon [2] developed programs\nfor playing chess to validate initial ideas in AI. For more\nthan half a century, games have continued to be AI testbeds\nfor novel ideas, and the resulting achievements have marked\nimportant milestones in the history of AI [3]–[17]. Notable\nexamples include the checkers-playing bot Chinook winning\na world championship against top humans [3], Deep Blue\nbeating Kasparov in chess [4], and AlphaGo defeating Lee\nSedol [6] in the complex ancient Chinese game Go. Although\nsubstantial progress has been made in solving these large-scale\nperfect-information games that all players know the exact state\nof the game at every decision point, it remains challenging\nto solve large-scale imperfect-information games that require\nreasoning under the uncertainty about the opponents’ hidden\nKai Li, Hang Xu, and Enmin Zhao contributed equally to this work.\nJunliang Xing is the corresponding author.\nKai Li, Hang Xu, Enmin Zhao, Zhe Wu, and Junliang Xing are with the\nInstitute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and School of Artiﬁ-\ncial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China\n(e-mail: kai.li@ia.ac.cn; xuhang2020@ia.ac.cn; zhaoenmin2018@ia.ac.cn;\nwuzhe2019@ia.ac.cn; jlxing@nlpr.ia.ac.cn).\nThis work was supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation\nof China under Grant No. 62076238 and 61902402, in part by the Na-\ntional Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant No.\n2020AAA0103401, in part by the CCF-Tencent Open Fund, and in part by\nthe Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences\nunder Grant No. XDA27000000.\ninformation. The hidden information is omnipresent in real-\nworld strategic interactions, such as business, negotiation, and\nﬁnance, making the research of imperfect-information games\nparticularly important both theoretically and practically.\nPoker has a long history as a challenging problem for\ndeveloping algorithms that deal with hidden information [18],\n[19]. The poker game involves all players being dealt with\nsome private cards visible only to themselves, with players\ntaking structured turns making bets, calling opponents’ bets,\nor folding. As one of the most popular global card games,\npoker has played an essential role in developing general-\npurpose techniques for imperfect-information games. In par-\nticular, No-limit Texas Hold’em (NLTH), the world’s most\npopular form of poker, has been the primary testbed for\nimperfect-information game research for decades because of\nits large-scale decision space and strategic complexity. For\nexample, Heads-up No-limit Texas Hold’em (HUNL), the\nsmallest variant of NLTH, has 10161 decision points [20]\nwhich makes it almost impossible to solve directly.\nThere have been many efforts to design poker AIs for\nNLTH over the past few years [21], [22]. Most of these\nsystems exploit some equilibrium-ﬁnding algorithms, e.g.,\ncounterfactual regret minimization (CFR) [23], with various\nabstraction strategies to merge similar game states to reduce\nthe size of the game tree. Recently, a series of breakthroughs\nhave been made in the NLTH AI research community. Deep-\nStack [16], which combines the continual re-solving and the\ndepth-limited sparse look-ahead algorithms, defeated 10 out\nof 11 professional poker players by a statistically signiﬁcant\nmargin. Libratus [17] defeated a team of four top HUNL-\nspecialist professionals by using a nested safe subgame solving\nalgorithm with an extensible blueprint strategy. Pluribus [24]\ndefeated elite human professional players in six-player NLTH\nby extending the techniques behind Libratus.\nAlthough many important milestones have been achieved\nin NLTH AI research in recent years, the problem is far\nfrom being solved, and there remain many theoretical and\ncomputational issues to be addressed. For example, the game-\ntheoretic solution for multiplayer NLTH, the best way to game\ntree abstraction, more efﬁcient equilibrium-ﬁnding algorithms\nthat converge faster and consume fewer resources, etc. To\nsolve these challenges, further studies are urgently needed.\nHowever, one main obstacle to further research in NLTH AI\nis the lack of standard benchmarks in this area. First, there are\nno standard evaluation protocols in this community; different\npapers use different evaluation metrics, making comparisons\nof different methods difﬁcult. Second, there is no publicly\navailable baseline AI which can serve as a starting point for\narXiv:2012.06168v4  [cs.LG]  14 Dec 2021\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XX 2021\n2\nfuture improvements. Third, there are no public easy-to-use\nplatforms for researchers to test the performance of their AIs\nat any time.\nConsidering the important role of standard benchmarks in\nAI development, we present OpenHoldem, a benchmark for\nNLTH AI research developed to boost the studies on large-\nscale imperfect-information games. OpenHoldem provides an\nintegrated toolkit for evaluating NLTH AIs with three main\ncomponents: the evaluation protocols, the baseline AIs, and\na testing platform. For each component, we have made the\nfollowing contributions to the community:\n• For the evaluation part, we propose to use four differ-\nent evaluation metrics to test different algorithms from\ndifferent aspects comprehensively.\n• For the baseline part, we design and implement four\ndifferent types of NLTH AIs: rule-based AI, CFR based\nstatic AI, DeepStack-like online AI, and deep reinforce-\nment learning based AI. These diverse AIs can serve as\nstrong baselines for further development in this ﬁeld.\n• For the platform part, we develop an online testing\nplatform with multiple NLTH AIs built-in. Researchers\ncan link their AIs to this platform through easy-to-use\nAPIs to play against each other for mutual improvement.\nOur proposed OpenHoldem provides a standardized bench-\nmark for the NLTH AI research. The adopted approach,\nnamely to propose an evaluation protocol via several metrics,\nthe provision of baselines tested to have strong performances,\nand the establishment of an online testing platform, is per-\nfectly rigorous and will allow algorithm improvements and\ncomparisons with the state-of-the-arts, which impossible to do\ntoday without spending much time re-implementing other peo-\nple’s methods. OpenHoldem can potentially have a signiﬁcant\nimpact on the poker AI research, and more generally in the\nAI community dealing with decision-making problems under\nuncertainty. We hope that OpenHoldem makes the NLTH AI\nresearch easier and more accessible, and further facilitates\nthe research of the key problems in large-scale imperfect-\ninformation games, such as large-scale equilibrium-ﬁnding,\nopponent modeling, human-computer interactive learning, and\nonline exploiting sub-optimal opponents.\nII. RELATED WORK\nStandard benchmarks have played an indispensable role\nin promoting the research in many AI tasks like speech\nrecognition, computer vision, and natural language process-\ning. For example, in the task of speech to text, the NIST\nSwitchboard benchmark [25] helps reduce the word error rate\nfrom 19.3% in 2000 to 5.5% in 2017; In the task of image\nclassiﬁcation, the creation of the ImageNet [26] benchmark\nhas helped in the development of highly efﬁcient models\nwhich reduce the image classiﬁcation error rate from 26.2%\ndown to 1.8%; In the task of machine translation, the WMT\nbenchmark helps the machine translation system achieves\nhuman-level performance on the Chinese to English translation\ntask [27]. These benchmarks that have greatly inﬂuenced\nthe research communities have some common characteristics:\nclear evaluation metrics, rich baseline models, and convenient\nonline testing platforms. Motivated by this, we propose the\nOpenHoldem benchmark that meets the above requirements to\nfacilitate the future development of general-purpose techniques\nfor large-scale imperfect-information games.\nThere are already some benchmarks on game AI. Examples\ninclude the Atari environments in OpenAI Gym [28], ViZ-\nDoom [29], and MineRL [30], but most of these benchmarks\nare oriented towards the research of reinforcement learning\nalgorithms. Recently, some benchmarks for game theory re-\nsearch have been proposed. For example, Google DeepMind\nreleases the OpenSpiel [31] benchmark, which contains a\ncollection of environments and algorithms for research in n-\nplayer zero-sum and general-sum games. Although OpenSpiel\nimplements many different kinds of games and state-of-the-\nart algorithms, it currently does not provide high-performance\nNLTH AIs. RLCard [32] developed by the Texas A&M\nUniversity includes many large-scale complex card games,\nsuch as Dou dizhu, Mahjong, UNO, Sheng Ji, and NLTH.\nHowever, most of the implemented baseline AIs are relatively\nweak. In contrast, the proposed OpenHoldem contains very\nstrong baseline AIs, which can serve as a better starting point\nfor future improvements.\nTexas Hold’em, the primary testbed for imperfect informa-\ntion game research, has been studied in the computer poker\ncommunity for years [19]. The earliest Texas Hold’em AIs\nare rule-based systems that consist of a collection of if-then\nrules written by human experts. For example, the early agents\n(e.g., Loki [33]) produced by the University of Alberta are\nmostly based on carefully designed rules. While the rule-\nbased approach provides a simple framework for implementing\nTexas Hold’em AIs, the resulting handcrafted strategies are\neasily exploitable by observant opponents. Since 2006, the\nAnnual Computer Poker Competition (ACPC) [34] has greatly\nfacilitated poker AI development, and many game-theoretic\nTexas Hold’em AIs are proposed [21], [22]. These systems\nﬁrst use various abstraction strategies [35], [36] to merge\nsimilar game states to reduce the game size, then exploit some\nequilibrium-ﬁnding algorithms (e.g., CFR [23] and its various\nvariants [37]–[40]) to ﬁnd the approximate Nash equilibrium\nstrategies which are robust to different opponents.\nRecently, the research on these game-theoretic approaches\nhas made signiﬁcant breakthroughs. Examples include Deep-\nStack [16] proposed by the University of Alberta that defeats\nprofessional poker players by a large margin, Libratus [17]\nfrom the Carnegie Mellon University that decisively defeats\nfour top HUNL-specialist professionals, and Pluribus [24]\nas a direct descendant of Libratus that defeats elite human\nprofessional players in six-player NLTH. Nevertheless, almost\nall of these Texas Hold’em AIs are not publicly available,\nmaking it very challenging for new researchers to study this\nproblem further. Our OpenHoldem is the ﬁrst open benchmark\nwith publicly available strong baseline AIs for large-scale\nimperfect-information game research.\nIII. PRELIMINARIES\nHere we present some background knowledge needed for\nthe rest of the paper. We ﬁrst provide some notations to\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XX 2021\n3\nformulate imperfect-information games. Next, we discuss the\nCFR algorithm which is the most commonly used equilibrium-\nﬁnding algorithm for imperfect-information games. Finally, we\nintroduce the game rule of no-limit Texas Hold’em.\nA. Imperfect-Information Games\nImperfect-information games are usually described by a\ntree-based formalism called extensive-form games [41]. In an\nimperfect-information extensive-form game G there is a ﬁnite\nset N = {1,. . ., N} of players, and there is also a special\nplayer c called chance; H refers to a ﬁnite set of histories,\neach member h ∈H denotes a possible history (or state),\nwhich consists of actions taken by players including chance;\ng ⊑h denotes the fact that g is equal to or a preﬁx of h;\nZ ⊆H denotes the terminal states and any member z ∈Z is\nnot a preﬁx of any other states; A(h) = {a : ha ∈H} is the\nset of available actions in the non-terminal state h ∈H \\ Z;\nA player function P : H \\ Z →N ∪{c} assigns a member\nof N ∪{c} to each non-terminal state in H \\ Z, i.e., P(h) is\nthe player who takes an action in state h.\nFor a state set {h ∈H : P(h) = i}, Ii denotes an infor-\nmation partition of player i; A set Ii ∈Ii is an information\nset of player i and I(h) represents the information set which\ncontains the state h. If g and h belong to the same information\nset Ii, then the player i cannot distinguish between them,\nso we can deﬁne A(Ii) = A(h) and P(Ii) = P(h) for\narbitrary h ∈Ii. We deﬁne |I| = maxi∈N |Ii| and |A| =\nmaxi∈N maxIi∈Ii |A(Ii)|. For each player i ∈N, a utility\nfunction ui(z) deﬁne the payoff received by player i upon\nreaching a terminal state z. ∆i is the range of payoffs reach-\nable by player i, i.e., ∆i = maxz∈Z ui(z) −minz∈Z ui(z)\nand ∆= maxi∈N ∆i.\nA strategy proﬁle σ = {σi|σi ∈Σi, i ∈N} is a\nspeciﬁcation of strategies for all players, where Σi is the\nset of all possible strategies for player i, and σ−i refers to\nthe strategies of all players other than player i. For each\nplayer i ∈N, its strategy σi assigns a distribution over\nA(Ii) to each information set Ii of player i. The strategy\nof the chance player σc is usually a ﬁxed probability dis-\ntribution. σi(a|h) denotes the probability of action a taken\nby player i ∈N at state h. In imperfect information games,\n∀h1, h2 ∈Ii, we have σi(Ii) = σi(h1) = σi(h2). The\nstate reach probability of h is denoted by πσ(h) if all\nplayers take actions according to the strategy proﬁle σ. The\nstate reach probability can be composed into each player’s\ncontribution, i.e., πσ(h) = Q\ni∈N∪{c} πσ\ni (h) = πσ\ni (h)πσ\n−i(h),\nwhere πσ\ni (h) = Q\nh′a⊑h,P(h′)=i σi(a|h′) is player i′s con-\ntribution and πσ\n−i(h) = Q\nh′a⊑h,P(h′)̸=i σP(h′)(a|h′) is all\nplayers’ contribution except player i. The information set\nreach probability of Ii is deﬁned as πσ(Ii) = P\nh∈Ii πσ(h).\nThe interval state reach probability from state h′ to h is\ndeﬁned as πσ(h′, h) = πσ(h)\/πσ(h′) if h′ ⊑h. πσ\ni (Ii),\nπσ\n−i(Ii), πσ\ni (h′, h), and πσ\n−i(h′, h) are deﬁned similarly.\nFor each player i ∈N, the expected utility uσ\ni\n=\nP\nz∈Z πσ(z)ui(z) under a strategy proﬁle σ is the expected\npayoff of player i obtained at all possible terminal states.\nThe best response to the strategy proﬁle σ−i is any strategy\nσ∗\ni of player i that achieves optimal payoff against σ−i, i.e.,\nσ∗\ni = arg maxσ′\ni∈Σi u(σ′\ni,σ−i)\ni\n. For the two-player zero-sum\ngames, i.e., N = {1, 2} and ∀z ∈Z, u1(z) + u2(z) = 0,\nthe Nash equilibrium is the most commonly used solution\nconcept which is a strategy proﬁle σ∗= (σ∗\n1, σ∗\n2) such that\neach player’s strategy is the best response to the other. An\nϵ-Nash equilibrium is an approximate Nash equilibrium,\nwhose strategy proﬁle σ satisﬁes: ∀i ∈N, uσ\ni + ϵ ≥\nmaxσ′\ni∈Σi u(σ′\ni,σ−i)\ni\n. The exploitability of a strategy σi is\ndeﬁned as ϵi(σi) = uσ∗\ni −u\n(σi,σ∗\n−i)\ni\n. A strategy is unexploitable\nif ϵi(σi) = 0.\nB. Counterfactual Regret Minimization\nCounterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) [23] is an iter-\native algorithm for computing approximate Nash equilibrium\nin imperfect-information games and is widely used in NLTH\nAI. CFR frequently uses counterfactual value, which is the\nexpected payoff of an information set given that player i\ntries to reach it. Formally, for player i at an information\nset I ∈Ii given a strategy proﬁle σ, the counterfactual\nvalue of I is vσ\ni (I) = P\nh∈I(πσ\n−i(h) P\nz∈Z(πσ(h, z)ui(z)).\nThe counterfactual value of an action a in I is vσ\ni (a|I) =\nP\nh∈I(πσ\n−i(h) P\nz∈Z(πσ(ha, z)ui(z)).\nCFR typically starts with a random strategy σ1. On each\niteration T, CFR ﬁrst recursively traverses the game tree using\nthe strategy σT to calculate the instantaneous regret rT\ni (a|I)\nof not choosing action a in an information set I for player i,\ni.e., rT\ni (a|T) = vσT\ni\n(a|I) −vσT\ni\n(I). Then CFR accumulates\nthe instantaneous regret to obtain the cumulative regret\nRT\ni (a|I) = PT\nt=1 rt\ni(a|I) and uses regret-matching [42] to\ncalculate the new strategy for the next iteration:\nσT +1\ni\n(a|I) =\n\n\n\nRT,+\ni\n(a|I)\nP\na′∈A(I) RT,+\ni\n(a′|I),\nP\na′ RT,+\ni\n(a′|I) > 0\n1\n|A(I)|,\notherwise\n(1)\nwhere RT,+\ni\n(a|I) = max(RT\ni (a|I), 0).\nIn two-player zero-sum imperfect-information games, if\nboth players play according to CFR on each iteration then their\naverage strategies ¯σT converge to an ϵ-Nash equilibrium in\nO(|I|2|A|∆2\/ϵ2) iterations [23]. ¯σT is calculated as:\nST\ni (a|I)=\nT\nX\nt=1\n\u0010\nπσt\ni\n(I)σt\ni(a|I)\n\u0011\n, ¯σT\ni (a|I)=\nST\ni (a|I)\nP\na′∈A(I) ST\ni (a′|T ) .\n(2)\nThus, CFR is a ready-to-use equilibrium ﬁnding algorithm in\ntwo-player zero-sum games.\nC. No-limit Texas Hold’em\nNo-limit Texas hold’em (NLTH) has been the most widely\nplayed type of poker for more than a decade. The heads-\nup (i.e., two-player) variant prevents opponent collusion and\nallows a clear winner to be determined, so heads-up no-limit\nTexas hold’em (HUNL) becomes the primary testbed in the\ncomputer poker and game theory communities. HUNL is a\nrepeated game in which the two players play a match of\nindividual games, usually called hands. On each hand, one\nplayer will win some number of chips from the other player,\nand the goal is to win as many chips as possible throughout the\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XX 2021\n4\nmatch. In this paper, we follow the standard form of HUNL\npoker agreed upon by the research community [34], where\neach player starts each hand with a stack of $20,000 chips.\nResetting the stacks after each hand allows for each hand to\nbe an independent sample of the same game and is called\n“Doyle’s Game”, named for the professional poker player\nDoyle Brunson who publicized this variant.\nHUNL consists of four rounds of betting. On each round of\nbetting, each player can choose to either fold, call, or raise. If\na player folds, the game will end with no player revealing their\nprivate cards, and the opponent will take the pot. If a player\ncalls, he or she places several chips in the pot by matching the\namount of chips entered by the opponent. If a player raises by\nx, he or she adds x more chips to the pot than the opponent.\nA raise of all remaining chips is called an all in bet. A betting\nround ends if each player has taken actions and has entered\nthe same amount of chips in the pot as every other player still\nin the hand. At the beginning of a round, when there are no\nopponent chips yet to match, the raise action is called bet, and\nthe call action is called check. If either player chooses to raise\nﬁrst in a round, they must raise a minimum of $100 chips. If a\nplayer raises after another player has raised, that raise must be\ngreater than or equal to the last raise. The maximum amount\nfor a bet or raise is the remainder of that player’s stack, which\nis $20,000 at the beginning of a hand.\nIn HUNL, at the beginning of each hand, the ﬁrst player,\ni.e., P1, enters a big blind (usually $100) into the pot; the\nsecond player, i.e., P2, enters a small blind which is generally\nhalf the size of the big blind; and both players are then dealt\nwith two hole (private) cards from a standard 52-card deck.\nThere is then the ﬁrst round of betting (called the pre-ﬂop),\nwhere the second player P2 acts ﬁrst. The players alternate\nin choosing to fold, call or raise. After the pre-ﬂop, three\ncommunity (public) cards are dealt face up for all players to\nobserve, and the ﬁrst player P1 now starts a similar round of\nbetting (called the ﬂop) to the ﬁrst round. After the ﬂop round\nends, another community card is dealt face up, and the third\nround of betting (called the turn) commences where P1 acts\nﬁrst. Finally, a ﬁfth community card is dealt face up, and a\nfourth betting round (called the river) occurs, again with P1\nacting ﬁrst. If none of the players folds at the end of the fourth\nround, the game enters a show-down process: the private cards\nare revealed, the player with the best ﬁve-card poker hand (see\nFigure 1 for the hand strength), constructed from the player’s\ntwo private cards and the ﬁve community cards, wins the pot.\nIn the case of a tie, the pot is split equally among the players.\nFor a better understanding of these rounds, Figure 2 provides\na visualized example of the four rounds in one HUNL game.\nA match consists of a large number of poker hands, in which\nthe players alternate their positions as the ﬁrst and the second\nplayer. The rules of Six-player NLTH and HUNL are roughly\nthe same. For the detailed rules of Six-player NLTH, please\nrefer to the supplementary materials of [24].\nSince NLTH can be played for different stakes, such as\na big blind being worth $0.01 or $1000, it is inappropriate\nto measure the performance by chips, so players commonly\nmeasure their performance over a match as their average\nnumber of big blinds won per hand.

OPENHOLDEM\nAs shown in Figure 3, the proposed OpenHoldem bench-\nmark for large-scale imperfect information game research\nconsists of three parts: the evaluation protocols, the baseline\nAIs, and an online testing platform. Next, we will expatiate\nthese three parts respectively.\nA. Evaluation Protocols\nEvaluating the performance of different NLTH agents is\nchallenging due to the inherent variance present in the game.\nA better agent may lose in a short period simply because it\nwas dealt with weaker cards. Moreover, different papers use\ndifferent evaluation metrics, making comparisons of different\nmethods difﬁcult. In OpenHoldem, we propose using the\nfollowing evaluation metrics to test different algorithms from\ndifferent aspects thoroughly.\n1) Head-to-Head Based Evaluation Metrics: One of the\nmain goals of agent evaluation is to estimate the expected\nutility uσ\ni of some player i ∈N given a strategy proﬁle σ. If\nthe game is small, one can compute this expectation exactly by\nenumerating all terminal states, i.e., uσ\ni = P\nz∈Z πσ(z)ui(z).\nIn the large-scale NLTH, however, this approach is unpractical.\nThe most commonly used approach to approximately estimate\nuσ\ni is sampling. Speciﬁcally, the NLTH agents repeatedly play\nagainst each other, drawing independent samples z1, . . . , zT\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. XX, NO.

OpenHoldem provides an integrated toolkit for large-scale imperfect-\ninformation game research using NLTH with three main components: the\nevaluation protocols, the baseline NLTH AIs, and an online testing platform.\nwith the probability πσ(z). The estimator ˆuσ\ni is simply the\naverage utility,\nˆuσ\ni = 1\nT\nT\nX\nt=1\nui(zt).\n(3)\nThis estimator is unbiased, i.e., E[ˆuσ\ni ] = uσ\ni , so the mean-\nsquared-error (MSE) of ˆuσ\ni is its variance,\nMSE(ˆuσ\ni ) = Var[ˆuσ\ni ] = 1\nT Var[ui(z)].\n(4)\nThis sampling based approach is effective when the domain\nhas little stochasticity, i.e., Var[ui(z)] is small, but this is not\nthe case in NLTH. To alleviate the effects of randomness and\nensure statistically signiﬁcant results, we propose to use the\nfollowing two variance reduction techniques in head-to-head\nbased evaluation.\nDuplicate Poker is a simple variance reduction technique\nthat attempts to mitigate the effects of luck and is widely used\nin the Annual Computer Poker Competitions (ACPC) [34]. For\nexample, in HUNL, let us say agent A plays one seat and agent\nB plays the other seat. First, we let A and B play M hands of\npoker, then we switch their seats and play another M hands\nof poker with the same set of cards for each seat. By doing\nso, if agent A is dealt two aces in the ﬁrst hand, then agent\nB will be dealt two aces in the M + 1-th hand, so the effects\nof luck are signiﬁcantly alleviated. The process of duplicate\npoker for multiplayer NLTH is similar.\nAIVAT is a more principled variance reduction technique\nfor evaluating performance of agents in imperfect-information\ngames [43]. The core idea of AIVAT is to derive a real-valued\nfunction ˜ui that is used in place of the true utility function ui.\nOn one hand, the expectation of ˜ui(z) matches that of ui(z)\nfor any choice of strategy proﬁle σ, so ˜uσ\ni = 1\nT\nPT\nt=1 ˜ui(zt)\nis also an unbiased estimator of the expected utility uσ\ni . On\nthe other hand, the variance of ˜ui(z) is designed to be smaller\nthan that of ui(z), so MSE(˜uσ\ni ) < MSE(ˆuσ\ni ), i.e., ˜uσ\ni is a\nbetter estimator than ˆuσ\ni . More speciﬁcally, AIVAT adds a\ncarefully designed control variate term for both chance actions\nand actions of players with known strategies, resulting in a\nprovably unbiased low-variance evaluation tool for imperfect-\ninformation games. It is worth noting that duplicate poker and\nAIVAT can be combined to further reduce the variance.\n2) Exploitability Based Evaluation Metrics: Most works on\ncomputer poker are to approximate a Nash equilibrium, i.e.,\nproduce a low-exploitability strategy. However, head-to-head\nevaluation has been shown to be a poor equilibrium approxi-\nmation quality estimator in imperfect-information games [16].\nFor example, in the toy game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, consider\nthe exact Nash equilibrium strategy (i.e., playing each option\nwith equal probability) playing against a dummy strategy that\nalways plays “rock”. The head-to-head based evaluation results\nare a tie in this example, but the two strategies are vastly\ndifferent in terms of exploitability. Therefore, the exploitability\nis also a crucial evaluation metric in imperfect-information\ngames. The exploitability of one strategy can be measured\nby calculating its best-response strategy, but the large size\nof NLTH’s game tree makes an explicit best-response com-\nputation intractable. We propose to use the following two\ntechniques to calculate the exploitability approximately.\nLocal Best Response (LBR) is a simple and computation-\nally inexpensive method to ﬁnd a lower-bound on a strategy’s\nexploitability [44]. The most important concept in this algo-\nrithm is the agent’s range, i.e., the probability distribution on\neach of the possible private cards the agent holds. Suppose\nwe want to ﬁnd the LBR of the agent A with known strategy\nσa. At the beginning of each poker hand, it is equally likely\nthat A holds any pair of private cards. The probabilities of\nactions performed by A depend on the private cards it holds.\nKnowing the strategy of A, we can use Bayes’ theorem to\ninfer the probabilities that A holds each of the private cards.\nBased on the range of A, LBR greedily approximates the\nbest response actions, i.e., the actions which maximize the\nexpected utility under the assumption that the game will be\nchecked\/called until the end. Thus, LBR best-responds locally\nto the opponent’s actions by looking only at one action ahead,\nproviding a lower bound on the opponent’s exploitability.\nLBR also relies on playing standard poker hands, so the\nvariance reduction techniques (e.g., AIVAT) can be exploited\nto reduce the number of hands required to produce statistically\nsigniﬁcant results.\nDeep Reinforcement Learning Based Best Response\n(DRL-BR). Because the game tree of NLTH is too large, the\nLBR algorithm does not explicitly compute a best-response\nstrategy but uses its local approximation to play against the\nevaluated agent A directly. In DRL-BR, we try to explicitly\napproximate the best response strategy by training an DRL\nagent B against A. More speciﬁcally, by treating A as part\nof the environment, then from the perspective of B, the\nenvironment can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP). B can leverage some suitable DRL algorithms (e.g.,\nDQN [5], PPO [45], etc.) to learn to maximize its payoff\nfrom its experience of interacting with the environment, i.e.,\nplaying against A. This approach turns the problem of ﬁnding\nthe best response strategy into a single agent RL problem. An\napproximate solution of the MDP by RL yields an approximate\nbest response to the evaluated agent A. After obtaining the ap-\nproximate best response B, the head-to-head evaluation result\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XX 2021\n6\n(e.g., AIVAT) can be used to approximate the exploitability of\nA by having them repeatedly play against each other.\nB. Baseline AIs\nDespite signiﬁcant progress in designing NLTH AIs in\nrecent years, almost all of these AIs are not publicly available.\nThis situation makes it very challenging for new researchers to\nfurther study this problem since designing and implementing\na decent NLTH AI is often very complicated and tedious. To\nﬁll this gap, in OpenHoldem, we design and implement four\ndifferent types of NLTH AIs, which are strong enough to serve\nas a good starting point for future research in this area.\n1) Rule Based AI: The rule-based method is probably the\nmost straightforward way to implement NLTH AI. A rule-\nbased NLTH AI consists of a collection of rules designed by\ndomain experts. In OpenHoldem, we develop AR, a strong\nrule-based NLTH AI designed by some skilled Texas Hold’em\nplayers in our research group. Our rule-based AI AR handles\nabout 106 different scenarios that are likely to occur in the\nreal play of NLTH and contains tens of thousands of lines of\ncode. As a suggestion, when researchers implement their own\nNLTH AIs, it is useful to compare them to our rule-based AI\nAR as a sanity check.\nBesides the strong rule-based AI AR, we also designed\nsome other rule-based AIs with different styles and strengths\n(Table I). These agents can be used as learning materials\nfor beginners, and more importantly, they can also help re-\nsearchers to carry out research on opponent modeling. These\nrule-based AIs calculate the expected winning probability at\neach stage, and then make decisions based on these probabil-\nities and different predeﬁned rules.\n2) CFR Based Static AI: While the rule-based approach\nprovides a simple framework for implementing NLTH AIs,\nthe resulting strategies are exploitable. Therefore, most recent\nstudies in NLTH AIs are focused on approximating the the-\noretically unexploitable Nash equilibrium strategies. Among\nthem, the most successful approach is the CFR algorithm [23]\nand its various variants [38], [39], [46]. CFR type algorithms\niteratively minimizes the regrets of both players so that\nthe time-averaged strategy gradually approximates the Nash\nequilibrium. In OpenHoldem, we design and implement AC,\na strong CFR based NLTH AI, which aims to serve as a\nstarting point for the large-scale equilibrium-ﬁnding research.\nOverall, AC ﬁrst uses the abstraction algorithm to create a\nsmaller abstract game, then approximates the Nash equilibrium\nstrategy in this abstract game, and ﬁnally executes the resulting\nstrategy in the original game.\nThe abstraction algorithm aims to take a large-scale imper-\nfect information game as input and output a smaller but strate-\ngically similar game that is solvable by current equilibrium-\nﬁnding algorithms. It usually consists of two parts, information\nabstraction and action abstraction. In AC, we use the potential-\naware information abstraction algorithm [36], which uses the\nk-means algorithm with the earth mover’s distance metric to\ncluster cards with similar potential. Action abstraction further\nreduces the size of the game tree by restricting the available\nactions, which is especially important in games with large\nAlgorithm 1 The CFR+ algorithm which is used to train AC.\nInput: The abstract game G, the randomly initialized strategy\nproﬁle σ1, the zero initialized cumulative regret R0 and\ncumulative strategy S0.\nParameter: The number of iterations T.\nOutput: The approximate Nash equilibrium ¯σT = {¯σT\n1 , ¯σT\n2 }.\n1: for t = 1 →T do\n2:\nfor i = 1 →2 do\n3:\nvσt\ni (h) = P\nh⊑z,z∈Z πσt\n−i(h)πσt(h, z)ui(z)\n4:\nvσt\ni (a|h) = vσt\ni (ha)\n5:\nvσt\ni (Ii) = P\nh∈Ii vσt\ni (h)\n6:\nvσt\ni (a|Ii) = P\nh∈Ii vσt\ni (ha)\n7:\nrσt\ni (a|Ii) = vσt\ni (a|Ii) −vσt\ni (Ii)\n8:\nRt\ni(a|Ii) = max(0, Rt−1\ni\n(a|Ii) + rσt\ni (a|Ii))\n9:\nσt+1\ni\n(a|Ii) = Rt\ni(a|Ii)\/P\na∈A(Ii) Rt\ni(a|Ii)\n10:\nSt\ni(a|Ii) = St−1\ni\n(a|Ii) + πσt\ni (Ii)σt\ni(a|Ii)\n11:\nend for\n12: end for\n13: ¯σiT (a|Ii) = ST\ni (a|Ii)\/P\na∈A(Ii) ST\ni (a|Ii)\naction spaces, such as NLTH. In AC, we restrict the actions\nto Fold, Call\/Check, Bet Half Pot, Bet Pot, and All-In.\nAfter obtaining the manageable abstract game G, we use\nthe iterative CFR+ [38] algorithm to approximating the Nash\nequilibrium in G. As shown in Algorithm 1, given the current\nstrategy proﬁle σt, we ﬁrst calculate the cumulative regret of\neach action after t iterations in Line 8. Then, the new strategy\nin the t + 1-th iteration is updated in Line 9 by the regret-\nmatching algorithm. Finally, by normalizing the cumulative\nstrategy ST in Line 13, the average strategy ¯σT will approach\na Nash equilibrium when T is large enough. During the actual\nplay phase, AC ﬁrst ﬁnds the abstract state that corresponds\nto the current real state of the game. Then, the approximate\nNash equilibrium ¯σT of the abstract game is queried for\nthe probability distribution over different actions. Finally, an\naction is sampled from this distribution and played in the\nactual game, if applicable.\n3) DeepStack-Like Online AI: In essence, the AC agent is\na static table calculated ofﬂine that contains the probability\ndistributions over possible actions in all situations. During\nactual play, if the opponent chooses an action that is not\nin the action abstraction of AC, i.e., an off-tree action, AC\nround this off-tree action to a nearby in-abstraction action.\nA more principled approach to calculate the off-tree action’s\nresponse is by solving a subgame that immediately follows\nthat off-tree action. DeepStack [16] is a representative online\nalgorithm based on this idea. In particular, DeepStack allows\ncomputation to be focused on speciﬁc situations raised when\nmaking decisions using a sound local strategy computation\nalgorithm called continual re-solving. To make continual re-\nsolving computationally tractable, DeepStack replaces sub-\ntrees beyond a certain depth with a learned value function\nbased on deep neural network.\nThe authors of DeepStack [16] does not release the training\ncode or model for NLTH.

Speciﬁcally, we spend several weeks using\n120 GPUs to generate millions of training samples for the\nriver, turn, and ﬂop value networks. Each training sample\nis generated by running 1000 CFR+ iterations based on a\nrandom reach probability. Since generating these training data\nrequires huge computing resources, we will provide download\nlinks for these training data later. Everyone can freely use\nthese data for research. It is worth noting that Noam Brown,\nthe creator of Libratus, recently co-authored a paper [47], in\nwhich they also reimplemented DeepStack. AD has achieved\nsimilar results to theirs, which validates the correctness of our\nreimplementation.\n4) Deep Reinforcement Learning Based AI:\nThe three\nagents, i.e., the rule-based AI AR, the CFR based static\nAI AC, and the DeepStack-like online AI AD, described\nin the previous sections are all based on improvements of\nexisting techniques. These AIs often rely on different kinds\nof NLTH domain knowledge, such as expert rules in AR\nand handcrafted abstraction algorithms in AC. Besides, there\nare also computational issues, i.e., in the inference stage of\nAD, the CFR iteration process consumes much computation.\nSpeciﬁcally, to ensure AD’s high-quality prediction, this itera-\ntion process often needs to be carried out for more than 1,000\ntimes in practice.\nBased on the above considerations, in OpenHoldem, we\nfurther propose a high-performance and lightweight NLTH AI,\ni.e., ARL, obtained with an end-to-end deep reinforcement\nlearning framework. ARL adopts a pseudo-Siamese archi-\ntecture to directly learn from the input state information to\nthe output actions by competing the learned model with its\ndifferent historical versions. The main technical contributions\nof ARL include a novel state representation of card and betting\ninformation, a novel reinforcement learning loss function, and\na new self-play procedure to generate the ﬁnal model.

During\ninference, ARL takes only 3.8×10−3 second for each decision\nin a single-core CPU of 2.00GHz. ARL is the ﬁrst AI that\nobtains competitive performance in NLTH solely through RL.\na) The Overall Architecture: ARL aims to remove the\nexpensive computation of CFR iteration in both the training\nand testing stages of a NLTH AI while eliminating the need\nof domain knowledge. It thus pursues an end-to-end learning\nframework to perform efﬁcient and effective decision-making\nin imperfect-information games. Here end-to-end means that\nthe framework directly accepts the game board information\nand outputs the actions without encoding handcrafted features\nas inputs or performing iterative reasoning in the decision\nprocess. ARL adopts the RL framework to achieve this goal,\nand the only force to drive the model to learn is the reward.\nIn NLTH, the game board information includes the current\nand historical card information and the player action informa-\ntion. The agent chooses from a set of betting actions to play the\ngame and try to win more rewards. To capture the complex\nrelationship among the game board information, the desired\nbetting actions, and the game rewards, we design a pseudo-\nSiamese architecture equipped with the RL schema to learn\nthe underlying relationships from end to end. We illustrate the\nend-to-end learning architecture of ARL in Figure 4.\nAs shown in Figure 4, the input of the architecture is the\ngame state representations of action and card information,\nwhich are respectively sent to the top and bottom streams\nof the Siamese architecture.

To train ARL, we present a novel Trinal-Clip loss\nfunction to update the model parameters using RL algorithms.\nWe obtain the ﬁnal model through a new self-play procedure\nthat plays the current model with a pool of its K best historical\nversions to sample diverse training data from the huge game\nstate space. We believe these new techniques and underlying\nprinciples are helpful to develop general learning algorithms\nfor more imperfect-information games.\nb) Effective Game State Representation: The existence of\nprivate information and ﬂexibility of bet size cause the NLTH\nAI learning extremely challenging. To obtain an effective and\nsuitable feature representation for end-to-end learning from\nthe game state directly to the desired action, we design a new\nmulti-dimensional feature representation to encode both the\ncurrent and historical card and bet information.\nIn NLTH, the card and action information exhibit different\ncharacteristics. We thus represent them as two separated three-\ndimension tensors and let the network learn to fuse them\n(Figure 4). We design the card tensor in six channels to\nrepresent the agent’s two private cards, three ﬂop cards, one\nturn card, one river card, all public cards, and all private and\npublic cards. Each channel is a 4 × 13 sparse binary matrix,\nwith 1 in each position denoting the corresponding card. For\nthe action tensor, since there are usually at most six sequential\nactions in each of the four rounds, we design it in 24 channels.\nEach channel is a 4×nb sparse binary matrix, where nb is the\nnumber of betting options, and the four dimensions correspond\nto the ﬁrst player’s action, the second player’s action, the sum\nof two player’s action, and the legal actions. To understand this\nrepresentation, Figure 5 illustrates one example that a player\nin the small blind plays an action ‘bet pot’ after getting a hand\n‘AsAc’.\nThis representation has several advantages: 1) there is no\nabstraction of the card information thus reserves all the game\ninformation; 2) the action representation is general and can\ndenote different number of betting options (though nb = 9\nproduce satisfactory results in the experiment); 3) all the\nhistorical information is encoded to aid reasoning with hidden\ninformation; and 4) the multi-dimensional tensor representa-\ntion is very suitable for modern deep neural architectures like\nResNet [48] to learn effective feature hierarchies, as veriﬁed\nin the AlphaGo AI training.\nc) Effective Learning with Trinal-Clip PPO: With the\nmulti-dimensional feature representation, a natural choice is\nto use the current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algo-\nrithms such as PPO [45] to train the deep architecture. PPO\nis an actor-critic framework which trains a value function\nVθ(st) and a policy πθ(at|st). PPO deﬁnes a ratio function\nrt(θ) =\nπθ(at|st)\nπθ′(at|st) as the ratio between the current policy πθ\nand the old policy πθ′, and a policy loss function Lp as:\nLp(θ) = Et\nh\nmin\n\u0010\nrt(θ) ˆAt, clip (rt(θ), 1 −ϵ, 1 + ϵ) ˆAt\n\u0011i\n,\n(5)\nwhere ˆ\nAt is the advantage function, clip(rt(θ), 1 −ϵ, 1 + ϵ)\nensures rt lie in the interval (1−ϵ, 1+ϵ), and ϵ is a clip ratio\nhyper-parameter with typical value 0.2. PPO’s value loss Lv\nis deﬁned as:\nLv(θ) = Et\nh\n(Rγ\nt −Vθ(st))2i\n,\n(6)\nin which Rγ\nt represents the traditional γ-return [49].\nHowever, the above PPO loss function is difﬁcult to con-\nverge for NLTH AI training. We ﬁnd two main reasons for this\nproblem: 1) when πθ(at|st) ≫πθ′(at|st) and the advantage\nfunction ˆ\nAt<0, the policy loss Lp(θ) will introduce a large\nvariance; 2) due to the strong randomness of NLTH, the value\nloss Lv(θ) is often too large. To speed up and stabilize the\ntraining process, we design a Trinal-Clip PPO loss function. It\nintroduces one more clipping hyper-parameter δ1 for the policy\nloss when ˆ\nAt<0, and two more clipping hyper-parameters δ2\nand δ3 for the value loss. The policy loss function Ltcp for\nTrinal-Clip PPO is deﬁned as:\nLtcp(θ)=Et\nh\nclip (rt(θ), clip (rt(θ), 1−ϵ, 1+ϵ), δ1) ˆAt\ni\n,\n(7)\nwhere δ1 > 1+ϵ, and ϵ is the original clip in PPO. The clipped\nvalue loss function Ltcv for Trinal-Clip PPO is deﬁned as:\nLtcv(θ) = Et\nh\n(clip (Rγ\nt , −δ2, δ3) −Vθ(st))2i\n,\n(8)\nwhere δ2 and δ3 do not require manual tuning but represent\nthe total number of chips the player and the opponent has\nplaced, respectively. −δ2 represent the state value when the\nplayer folds, similarly, δ3 is the state value when the opponent\nfolds. This value-clip loss signiﬁcantly reduces the variance\nduring the training process. Our proposed Trinal-Clip PPO\nloss function improves the learning effectiveness of the actor-\ncritic framework, and we believe it is applicable for a wide\nrange of RL applications with imperfect information.\nd) Efﬁcient Self-Play Procedure:\nWith the proposed\nTrinal-Clip PPO loss function, the most direct way is using the\nself-play algorithm [50] to train the NLTH agent. However,\ndue to the private information in NLTH, simple self-play\nlearning designed for perfect information games [6], [8] often\ncauses the agent trapped in a local minimum and defeated\nby agents with counter-strategies. AlphaStar [11] designs a\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XX 2021\n9\npopulation-based training (PBT) procedure to maintain multi-\nple self-play agents and obtains excellent results in the real-\ntime strategy game StarCraft II. However, the PBT procedure\nneeds a tremendous computational resource to ensure good\nperformance.\nTo obtain a high-performance NLTH AI with both low\ncomputation cost and strong decision-making ability, we pro-\npose a new type of self-play algorithm which trains only one\nagent but learns strong and diverse policies. The proposed\nalgorithm maintains a pool of competing agents from the\nhistorical versions of the main agent. Then, by competing\namong different agents, the algorithm selects the K best\nsurvivors from their ELO [11] scores and generates training\ndata simultaneously. The main agent learns from the data\nand thus can compete with different opponents, maintaining a\nstrong decision-making ability of high-ﬂexible policies. Since\nthe proposed algorithm performs self-play among the main\nagent and its K best historical versions, we refer to it as K-\nBest Self-Play. Our proposed K-Best Self-Play inherits PBT’s\nmerit of diverse policy styles while maintains computational\nefﬁciency of single-thread agent training, striking a good\nbalance between efﬁciency and effectiveness.\nC. Online Testing Platform\nIn order to make the comparisons between different NLTH\nAIs easier, we develop an online testing platform with the\nabove four strong baseline AIs, i.e., AR, AC, AD and ARL\nbuilt-in. Researchers can compare the performances between\ntheir own AIs and the built-in baselines through easy-to-use\nAPIs. Figure 6 shows an example Python code of connecting\nto the platform for testing NLTH AIs. The NLTH AI designers\nonly need to implement one function, i.e., act, without caring\nabout the internal structure of the platform. The input of act\nis the current game state, which is obtained from the platform\nthrough TCP sockets. The output of act is the action to take in\nthe current game state according to the designer’s algorithm.\nThe output action is also sent to the platform through TCP\nsockets. Figure 7 shows the system architecture of our testing\nplatform. The server is responsible for playing the poker\nhands according to the rules of NLTH. It also dynamically\nschedules requests and allocates resources when necessary.\nOur platform not only supports testing between different AIs,\nbut also between humans and AIs.\nWe are more than happy to accept high-performance AIs\nsubmitted by everyone to continuously enrich the baseline\nAIs of OpenHoldem, with the ultimate goal of providing an\nNLTH AI Zoo for the research community. Currently, there\nare dozens of NLTH AI researchers and developers are using\nthis platform. It has accumulated about 20 million high-quality\npoker data and the data increases by about 100,000 per day.\nWe believe that these large-scale data will also facilitate the\nresearch of data-driven imperfect-information game solving,\nimitation learning and opponent modeling algorithms.\nV.

Comparison to the State-of-the-Arts\nTo the best of our knowledge, Slumbot [21], the champion\nof the 2018 Annual Computer Poker Competition (ACPC), is\nthe only publicly available NLTH AI that provides compar-\nisons through an online website2.

Although the performance of the CFR based\nAI AC is not as good as that of Slumbot, its performance is\nalso commendable because Slumbot exploits a far more ﬁne-\ngrained abstraction algorithm. An interesting result is that the\nrule-based AI AR outperforms Slumbot. This result is not\nsurprising, as it has been reported that the abstraction-based\nprograms from the Annual Computer Poker Competition are\nexploitable [44]. These experimental results illustrate that our\nbaseline NLTH AIs are adequate to serving as a good starting\npoint for NLTH AI research.\nThe DeepStack-like AI AD and the RL based AI ARL\nobtain the best performance among the four baselines. They\nare also the most complicated baselines in terms of design\nand implementation. Next, We conduct some ablation studies\nto understand the effects of their various design choices.\nB. Ablation Study on AD\n3We will open source this tool in OpenHoldem.\nTABLE III\nABLATION ANALYSES OF EACH COMPONENT OF ARL.\nName\nTraining time (Hours)\nELO\nVector\n3.8\n78\nPokerCNN\n5.4\n359\nW\/O History Information\n6.3\n896\nOriginal PPO Loss\n8.4\n1257\nDual-Clip PPO Loss\n8.4\n1308\nNaive Self-Play\n8.4\n1033\nBest-Win Self-Play\n8.4\n1024\nDelta-Uniform Self-Play\n8.6\n931\nPBT Self-Play\n8.9\n892\nARL\n8.4\n1597\n1) The Effects of Training Data Size: The training of the\nriver, turn, and ﬂop value networks of AD requires a lot of\ntraining data. We use AD\nx to denote the DeepStack-like NLTH\nAIs whose ﬂop networks are obtained by training with x\nmillion samples. Figure 8 shows the loss curves of the ﬂop\nnetwork during training when x ∈{1, 2, 3}. It is clear that\nthe ﬂop network suffers from severe over-ﬁtting when the\ntraining data size is small, and increasing the training data size\nalleviates this phenomenon. The head-to-head based evaluation\nresults (AIVAT) in Figure 9 also show that DeepStack-type AI\nis data-hungry and more training data results in a stronger AI.\n-222\n -13\n  93\nPerformance (mbb\/h)\nFig. 9. The head-to-head performances of AD\n1 , AD\n2 and AD\n3 when playing\nagainst Slumbot, respectively.\n2) The Effects of CFR Iterations During Continual Re-\nsolving: We use AD:y\n3\nto denote the DeepStack-like NLTH\nAIs, which use y CFR iterations during the continual re-\nsolving procedure. We ﬁnd that AD:500\n3\nloses 224 mbb to\nSlumbot per hand, while AD:1000\n3\nwins Slumbot 93 mbb per\nhand. These experimental results demonstrate that the number\nof CFR iterations during continual re-solving is critical to the\nperformance of DeepStack-type AI.\nC. Ablation Study on ARL\nTo analyze the effectiveness of each component of the\nRL based AI ARL, we have conducted extensive ablation\nstudies, as shown in Table III. The results of each row are\nobtained by replacing one component of ARL, and the rest\nremains unchanged. All models use the same number of\ntraining samples, and we use ELO scores to compare their\nperformance.\n1) The Effects of Different State Representations: For state\nrepresentation comparison, we consider three alternative meth-\nods: 1) Vectorized state representation like DeepCFR [51]\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. XX, NO.

Probabilities for not folding as the ﬁrst action for each possible hand. The bottom-left half shows the policy when the suits of two private cards do\nnot match, and the top-right half shows the policy when the suits of two private cards match. Left to right represent the policies of Professional Human, AD,\nand ARL, respectively.\n(Vector). It uses vectors to represent the card information (52-\ndimensional vectors) and the action information (each betting\nposition represented by a binary value specifying whether a\nbet has occurred and a ﬂoat value specifying the bet size); 2)\nPokerCNN-based state representation [52] (PokerCNN) uses\n3D tensors to represent card and action information together\nand use a single ConvNet to learn features; 3) State represen-\ntation without history information (W\/O History Information)\nis similar to ARL except that it does not contain history action\ninformation.\nAs shown in Table III, state representation has a signiﬁcant\nimpact on the ﬁnal performance. PokerCNN performs better\nthan the vectorized state representation Vector, demonstrating\nthat it is more effective to represent state information using\nstructured tensors. ARL outperforms PokerCNN since it uses\na pseudo-Siamese architecture to handle card and action\ninformation separately. ARL is also better than W\/O History\nInformation since historical action information is critical to\ndecision-making in NLTH. ARL obtains the best performance\nthanks to its effective multi-dimensional state representation,\nwhich encodes historical information and is suitable for Con-\nvNets to learn effective feature hierarchies.\n2) The Effects of Different Loss Functions: For the loss\nfunction, we evaluate ARL’s Trinal-Clip PPO loss against two\nkinds of PPO losses: 1) the Original PPO loss [45] (Original\nPPO); 2) the Dual-Clip PPO loss [14] (Dual-Clip PPO). As\nshown in Table III, compared with the Original PPO, Dual-\nClip PPO has a slight performance boost, and Trinal-Clip\nPPO (ARL) obtains the best performance. This performance\nimprovement is mainly because ARL’s policy-clip and value-\nclip loss effectively limit its output to a reasonable range, thus\nensuring the stability of the policy update. In addition, we ﬁnd\nthe model with a small overall loss generally performs better\nafter adding the value-clip loss, which is very convenient for\nmodel selection during training.\n3) The Effects of Different Self-Play Methods: For self-\nplay methods, we compare ARL’s K-Best Self-Play with 1)\nNaive Self-Play [50], which plays with the agent itself; 2) Best-\nWin Self-Play [6], which plays with the best agent in history;\n3) Delta-Uniform Self-Play [53], which plays with the agent\nin the last δ timestamps; and 4) PBT Self-Play [11], which\ntrains multiple agents and play with each other. Interestingly,\ncompared with the more sophisticated Delta-Uniform Self-\nPlay and PBT Self-Play, Naive Self-Play and Best-Win Self-\nPlay achieve better performance, possible because more com-\nplex self-play strategies are more data-hungry. However, the\nperformance of Naive and Best-Win Self-Play are still behind\nK-Best Self-Play, since simplistic self-play methods can not\novercome the notorious cyclical strategy problem in imperfect-\ninformation games. Our K-Best Self-Play method obtains the\nbest performance under the same amount of training data,\nstriking a good balance between efﬁciency and effectiveness.\n4) Exploitability Analysis: We evaluate the exploitability of\nARL with LBR. However, we ﬁnd that LBR fails to exploit\nARL, i.e., LBR loses to ARL by over 335.82 mbb\/h in\n40,000 hands. While this result does not prove that ARL is\nﬂawless, it does demonstrate that ARL seeks to compute and\nplay a low-exploitability strategy. ARL’s low exploitability is\nmainly attributed to its effective state representation, which\nencodes historical information to alleviate the partial observ-\nable problem and its efﬁcient self-play strategy to address the\ngame-theoretic challenges (i.e., cyclical strategy behavior) in\nimperfect-information games.\n5) Visualization of the Learned Policy: To analyze ARL’s\nlearned policy, we compare the action frequencies where the\nagent is the ﬁrst player to act and has no prior state inﬂuencing\nit [47] with those from human professional4 and AD. Figure 10\nshows the policies on how to play the ﬁrst two cards from the\nprofessional human and the two agents. The polices of AD\nand ARL are very similar to those of the human professional,\nwhich further explains their good performance.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we present OpenHoldem, a benchmark for\nlarge-scale imperfect-information game research using NLTH.\nOpenHoldem provides an integrated toolkit with three main\ncomponents: the comprehensive evaluation protocols, the\nstrong baseline NLTH AIs, and an easy-to-use online testing\nplatform. We plan to add more NLTH AIs to OpenHoldem in\nthe future, with the ultimate goal of providing an NLTH AI\nZoo for the research community. We hope OpenHoldem will\nfacilitate further studies on the unsolved theoretical and com-\nputational issues in large-scale imperfect-information games.\n4Obtained from https:\/\/www.wsop.com\/how-to-play-poker\/\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL.

Our code, evaluation data and the benchmark\ncan be found on https:\/\/asgaardlab.github.io\/LLMxBugs\nIntroduction\nSimilar to other software products, a video game must be\nthoroughly tested to assure its quality. Game testing is an\numbrella term for many types of tests that cover different\naspects of the game. For example, a rendering test aims to\nverify the visual quality of the output, whereas a gameplay\ntest assesses whether the game is engaging enough. While\nit is possible to automate some game testing elements, e.g.,\nby using advanced vision models to detect graphical issues\nautomatically (Taesiri, Macklon, and Bezemer 2022), most\ngame testing aspects still require a human tester (Pascarella\net al. 2018). Two of the main challenges that prevent the\nautomation of game testing are the difﬁculty to automate\n(1) knowledge about the game context and (2) common\nsense reasoning (Politowski, Petrillo, and Guéhéneuc 2021).\nMany video games rely on a physics engine that deﬁnes\nthe rules of the world in which the game is situated (Milling-\n1Source: https:\/\/redd.it\/2s5xon\na\nc\nb\nQ: In the Grand Theft Auto V video game, the following sequence of \nevents happened:\n(a) A person is parachuting in the air.\n(b) A plane approaches the parachuter.\n(c) The plane hits the cord and loses its right wing.\n(d) The plane falls from the sky.\nWhich event is a bug?\nA: The plane hitting the cord and losing its right wing is a bug.\nAmong (a) through (d), the answer is (c).\nd\nFigure 1: An example of using a large language model to\ndetect a video game bug by classifying a sequence of events\nin the Grand Theft Auto V1 video game in which a collision\nbetween a plane and parachute cords leads to the plane los-\ning its right wing. The highlighted text shows the response\nof the davinci model from the InstructGPT family.\nton 2007). For some games, there are sharp contrasts be-\ntween the game world and the natural laws of the real world.\nThese differences make it hard to reason about events in\nvideo games without knowing the game context. For exam-\nple, is it a bug that the player survives after falling from a\nvery high height? Answering such a question is impossible\nwithout having knowledge about the target video game.\nIn this study, we propose using the game context knowl-\nedge and common sense reasoning capabilities of large lan-\nguage models (LLMs) to identify buggy events in video\ngames and classify their bug type. Recent revolutions in nat-\narXiv:2210.02506v1  [cs.CL]  5 Oct 2022\nural language processing (NLP) show that scaling up lan-\nguage models is beneﬁcial in many tasks (Vaswani et al.\n2017; Devlin et al. 2018; Rae et al. 2021; Chowdhery et al.\n2022; Thoppilan et al. 2022), such as few-shot and zero-shot\nlearning (Brown et al. 2020; Kojima et al. 2022). Having\nbeen trained on very large datasets, LLMs have the poten-\ntial to capture many details about topics in their training set,\nincluding video games. Figure 1 shows an example of suc-\ncessful bug detection by a language model.\nWe are the ﬁrst to empirically evaluate the capability of\nLLMs as zero-shot video game bug detectors. Our main con-\ntributions are as follows:\n1. We present the GameBugDescriptions dataset, the\nﬁrst dataset of videos of game bugs with a step-by-\nstep textual description for bug detection purposes. This\ndataset can serve as an out-of-distribution (OOD) chal-\nlenge for LLMs.\n2. We are the ﬁrst to show that large language models have\npromising capabilities to detect video game bugs.\n3. We extensively evaluate the performance of two fami-\nlies of large language models on the bug detection and\nbug type classiﬁcation tasks: InstructGPT (Ouyang et al.\n2022) and OPT (Zhang et al. 2022).\n4. We analyze the robustness of language models to differ-\nent descriptions of the same event for these tasks.\nOur study demonstrates the promising capabilities of\nLLMs to play an important role in the automation of the\ngame testing process.\nBackground and Related Work\nOur work bridges the language modeling, video game, and\nsoftware engineering research communities. In this section,\nwe provide a brief overview of the relevant literature across\nthese disciplines, in particular, on large language models and\nprompt engineering, and automated game testing.\nLarge Language Models and Prompt Engineering\nThe training objective in a language model is to learn a prob-\nability distribution over some text corpus. Such a simple\ntraining objective combined with sufﬁcient model scaling\ncan yield large language models that are successful even for\ntasks for which the model was not explicitly trained (Ka-\nplan et al. 2020; Brown et al. 2020; Chowdhery et al. 2022;\nThoppilan et al. 2022).\nPrompting or prompt engineering (Liu et al. 2021) is an\neffective technique wherein we condition a language model\non a set of manually handcrafted (Schick and Schütze 2020;\nKojima et al. 2022) or automated (Gao, Fisch, and Chen\n2020) templates to solve new tasks. That is, new tasks can\nbe solved by giving natural language instructions to a pre-\ntrained model without any further training, e.g., by provid-\ning sample reasoning steps to the model (Wei et al. 2022) in\na few-shot setting. Moreover, Kojima et al. (2022) showed\nthat even with a prompting technique as simple as adding\n“Let’s think step by step” to the beginning of the answer, it is\npossible to trigger the reasoning in language models, which\nleads to higher accuracy improvement on multiple bench-\nmarks in zero-shot setting. Using graphical models Dohan\net al. (2022) introduced a general formulation for prompted\nmodels, enabling probabilistic programming with LLMs.\nSeveral successful applications of LLMs include program\nsynthesis (Jain et al. 2022), code generation (Chen et al.\n2021) or chatbots (Thoppilan et al. 2022). However, we are\nthe ﬁrst to apply LLMs to detect bugs in video games.\nAutomated Game Testing\nAs shown by prior work, automated game testing is chal-\nlenging because game-speciﬁc knowledge and common\nsense reasoning are required to detect and report bugs (Pas-\ncarella et al. 2018; Politowski, Petrillo, and Guéhéneuc\n2021). The majority of prior work on automated game test-\ning focuses on methods to automatically play games, such\nas heuristic search strategies (Keehl and Smith 2019). Auto-\nmated play techniques using reinforcement learning or evo-\nlutionary strategies (Zheng et al. 2019; Vinyals et al. 2019;\nBerner et al. 2019; Justesen et al. 2019) allow the testing\nof video games from different perspectives, such as playa-\nbility, game balance, and even predicting user churn rate\n(Roohi et al. 2020, 2021). However, these methods are of-\nten designed to maximize a certain reward function, which\nmight lead to progress in the game in an unintended manner\nand even break the game’s rules or physics engine (Baker\net al. 2020; Clark and Amodei 2019). More importantly,\nthese methods do not have common sense reasoning.\nOther prior work has leveraged computer vision and NLP\ntechniques for automated video game testing. Several stud-\nies have proposed approaches for graphical bug detection us-\ning deep learning (Ling, Tollmar, and Gisslén 2020; Taesiri,\nHabibi, and Fazli 2020) or digital image processing (Mack-\nlon et al. 2022). However, these approaches do not re-\nquire common sense reasoning. For example, Macklon et al.\n(2022) rely on graphical assets of the game as a test oracle.\nSeveral other studies have proposed approaches to re-\ntrieve moments from gameplay videos based on text\nqueries (Zhang and Smith 2019; Taesiri, Macklon, and Beze-\nmer 2022). However, to detect bugs with these approaches\nthe bug instance must be known in advance, and therefore\nthese gameplay event retrieval approaches do not allow for\nautomated detection of (previously undiscovered) bugs. Our\napproach does not have this requirement and can therefore\nbe used to identify previously undiscovered bugs.\nFinally, prior work has proposed NLP-based approaches\nto automatically improve test case descriptions for manual\nplaytesting of games (Viggiato et al. 2022a,b), but we are\nthe ﬁrst to leverage LLMs for bug detection in video games.\nBug Detection with Large Language Models\nTo automatically identify buggy events in a video game, we\npropose using LLMs to reason about sequences of textual\ndescriptions of game events. We formulate the problem as a\nquestion-answering (Q&A) task (Srivastava et al. 2022) for\nLLMs. Here, we explain how we convert textual descriptions\nof a sequence of game events into a multiple-choice question\nand use a language model to identify the buggy event. In ad-\ndition, we discuss how LLMs can assist us to classify the bug\nQ: Explain how the player levels up in the Skyrim \nvideo game?\nA: The player levels up by gaining experience \npoints. Experience points are gained by killing \nenemies, completing quests, and discovering \nlocations. The player can also gain experience \npoints by using a skill.\nGame Mechanics - OPT 66B\nHow does the player level up their attributes \nin the Red Dead Redemption 2 video game?\nIn Red Dead Redemption 2, the player levels \nup their attributes by completing challenges \nand tasks. These challenges and tasks can be \nfound throughout the game, and can be \ncompleted in a number of ways, such as by \nkilling enemies, completing missions, or \ntrading with merchants. Completing these \nchallenges and tasks will increase the \nplayer's attributes, such as their health, \nstrength, and shooting accuracy.\nGame Mechanics - text-curie-001\nExplain the mechanics of Grappling Hook in \nthe Just Cause 3 video game:\nThe grappling hook in Just Cause 3 is a tool \nthat allows the player to attach themselves \nto objects and then swing from them.

First, we motivate our methodology by demonstrating\nthe game knowledge of LLMs.\nLarge Language Models and Game Knowledge:\nTo ver-\nify whether LLMs possess game knowledge, we conducted\nan informal analysis on a set of 34 multiple-choice and 10\nfree format questions that was designed by us. The davinci\nmodel can answer 91% of the questions correctly. Figure 2\ndepicts a few cases showing language models of different\nsizes exhibiting game-speciﬁc knowledge in a zero-shot set-\nting. In the remainder of this section, we explain how we\nleverage the game knowledge of LLMs for the more chal-\nlenging task of bug detection for video games.\nProblem Formulation:\nFor a sequence S of textual\ndescriptions of events ei in a video game G (S\n=\n{e1, e2, · · · en}) we design the triplet ⟨Q, S, A⟩, in which Q\nis a question template and A is the correct answer (i.e., the\nbuggy event). By presenting S as multiple choice options\n(e.g., (a) through (d) in Figure 1), this triplet allows us to use\na language model to detect bugs in a game event sequence.\nWe leverage Q to provide context information to the lan-\nguage model. Identifying buggy events in a video game re-\nquires context, because events in a video game can be un-\nrealistic yet valid for that game. For example, in the Grand\nTheft Auto V video game, a player would die when they fall\nfrom a height, while in the Marvel’s Spider-Man game, the\nplayer would not take any damage. Therefore, we modify Q\nto include a string template G, which is a placeholder for\nthe game’s name, which is used by the language model as a\nreference point. We design each question as follows:\nIn the [G] video game, the following sequence of events\nhappened:\n[S]\nWhich event is a bug?\nMulti-Stage Prompting\nFollowing Kojima et al. (2022), we propose a two-stage\nprompting technique for eliciting reasoning in language\nmodels. This technique enables LLMs to provide step-by-\nstep reasoning for their answer, leading to higher accuracy\nand better interpretability, which allows us to debug the ﬁnal\nanswer and understand in which step the model goes wrong.\nStage 1 - Elicit Reasoning:\nSimilar to prior work (Mc-\nCann et al. 2018; Radford et al. 2019; Schick and Schütze\n2021) for each triplet ⟨Q, S, A⟩, we use a string template\n“Q: [X]. [Z]\" in which [X] is the input slot for con-\ncatenation of a question template Q containing the game\nname, and the sequence of events S. The “Q:\" text in the\ntemplate is a ﬁxed string that implies we are asking a ques-\ntion. The [Z] slot is for the trigger sentence added to the\nbeginning of the answer. The purpose of the trigger sentence\nis two-fold: (1) to assist the language model in reaching the\nanswer progressively, and (2) to inject different perspectives\nin the classiﬁcation, e.g., to see events as a game designer,\nplayer, or compared with the real world.\nWe feed the question and trigger sentence to a language\nmodel to provoke step-by-step reasoning and use the gener-\nated text in Stage 2.\nStage 2 - Answer Extraction:\nWe rely on the language\nmodel to extract the ﬁnal answer from the generated text,\ngiven the intermediate results, instead of performing text\nprocessing. To this end, we concatenate the inputs and re-\nsults from the previous stage and append an ‘answer extrac-\ntion’ prompt to the end. We can use different answer extrac-\ntion prompts depending on the format of the ﬁnal answer.\nSince we have a multiple choice format, we use the “Among\n(a) through (d), the answer is” prompt.\nBug Type Classiﬁcation\nIn addition to identifying the buggy event, classifying the\ntype of bug is helpful for bug prioritization, as described by\nTruelove, de Almeida, and Ahmed (2021). Therefore, as a\nsecondary objective, we are interested in determining if lan-\nguage models can correctly classify video game bug types.\nTo this end, we design another question template in which\nwe provide the event description and the ground truth and\nask the model to classify the type of the video game bug.\nIn the [G] video game, the following sequence of events\nhappened:\n[eb]\nWhat is the type of bug?\n[O]\nIn which O contains the bug types as multiple choice op-\ntions, and eb is the buggy event in the original sequence.\nDataset\nTo evaluate the capabilities of LLM for identifying game\nbugs, we created the GameBugDescriptions dataset, a\ncollection of videos of real game bugs. Our dataset consists\nof a collection of 167 buggy gameplay videos, each with 2\ntextual descriptions of the events in the videos, and a bug-\ntype label per video. Each description includes up to four\nsentences describing the events in the video without reason-\ning about their bugginess. To assess the robustness of lan-\nguage models to different descriptions, we provide two de-\nscriptions written by two authors for each video. Each de-\nscription is converted into a question-answering format as\nexplained above, resulting in 334 question-answer pairs. We\nalso classify all 334 descriptions into 9 different bug types.\nData Collection:\nWe start with the GamePhysics\ndataset (Taesiri, Macklon, and Bezemer 2022), a collection\nof gameplay videos from different games. Following prior\nwork (Taesiri, Macklon, and Bezemer 2022), we focus on\neight popular video games (see Table 4) from this dataset\nand sample a total of 200 videos. We deﬁne several ex-\nclusion criteria to manually ﬁlter out videos that are un-\nsuitable for our study: (1) The video does not showcase a\nbug (but instead, e.g., a funny moment or impressive play-\ning skills), (2) The video showcases a severe graphical bug\n(e.g., a glitch) and (3) The video is related to a game modiﬁ-\ncation (e.g., the contents or logic of the game were changed\nthrough manual modiﬁcation of the game ﬁles).\nLabeling:\nAfter ﬁltering, our dataset contains 167 videos,\nwith an average of 20 videos per game. Two of the authors\nlabelled each video separately without exchanging informa-\ntion during the labelling.2 Each label contains step-by-step\ntextual descriptions of events in the video without interpre-\ntation or reasoning about the events.3 The resulting dataset\ncontains a total of 334 descriptions with an average of 3.9\nsentences per video. In the rest of the paper, we denote each\nset of the descriptions as Descr1 and Descr2.\nWe also provide one bug type for each video in our\ndataset. One of the authors manually classiﬁed each video\ninto a single bug type, and another author ﬁnalized the clas-\nsiﬁcation by combining similar bug types while conﬁrming\nthat each video was suitably classiﬁed. During the classiﬁ-\ncation process, nine different bug types4 were extracted:\n• Player Animation: When the player’s body or limb is\nanimated incorrectly, such as twisted to an abnormal an-\ngle or moving uncontrollably.\n• Teleportation: An instantaneous movement of an object\nor character from one point to another.\n• Graphics: Objects or backgrounds are displayed incor-\nrectly on the screen, e.g., showing the wrong color, tex-\nture, or with the screen ﬂickering.\n• (De)Spawning: An object suddenly appears in (or disap-\npears out of) sight.\n• Collision: Objects are clipping through each other, or ob-\njects have interactions they are not supposed to have, like\nhitting an invisible wall.\n2Both authors are ﬂuent in English.\n3These authors had no access to any language model during the\nlabelling process and did not modify their labels in any way.\n4Note that several game bug taxonomies exist, however, they\nare not detailed enough to showcase the capabilities of LLM. The\npurpose of our paper is not to create a new bug taxonomy, but in-\nstead to demonstrate these capabilities.\nCyberpunk 2077\nFallout 4\nFar Cry 5\nGrand Theft Auto V\nJust Cause 3\nRed Dead Redemption 2\nThe Elder Scrolls V - Skyrim\nThe Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt\nPlayer Animation\nCollision\nGraphics\nIrregular force\nLogic\n(De)Spawning\nSliding objects\nSpinning objects\nTeleportation\n0\n2\n4\n1\n0\n0\n1\n6\n8\n3\n3\n3\n2\n6\n4\n4\n1\n2\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n9\n8\n10\n10\n10\n16\n11\n6\n3\n2\n0\n1\n3\n2\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n3\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n2\n0\n0\n1\n3\n2\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\nFigure 3: Distribution of bug types across games in the\nGameBugDescriptions dataset.\n• Spinning objects: An object is rotating without force be-\ning exerted on it.\n• Sliding objects: An object is sliding on the ground as if\nthere is little or no friction.\n• Irregular force: An object is acted upon by a force in a\nway that disobeys the game’s physics, such as an object\nsuddenly starting to ﬂoat.\n• Logic: Non-player characters (NPCs) do things that\nseem illogical, such as an ambulance driving on the side-\nwalk or running over pedestrians.\nThe Irregular force type is the most common bug type\namong all videos.

The median CLIP Score\nfor all 334 video descriptions in our dataset is 0.30, which\nhas been previously used as a reasonable similarity thresh-\nold (Schuhmann et al. 2021) based on human inspection.\nExperimental Setup\nWe executed two tasks in our experiments: (1) buggy event\nidentiﬁcation and (2) bug type classiﬁcation. In this section,\nwe discuss the experimental setup.\nModels:\nWe tested six models from the InstructGPT\n(Ouyang et al. 2022) and OPT (Zhang et al. 2022) fami-\nlies of models. We tested all four InstructGPT models (ada,\nbabbage, curie and davinci), which contain 0.3B to 175B pa-\nrameters5. We also ran our experiments on OPT models with\n66B and 175B parameters. In all experiments, we set the\ntemperature parameter to 0, and the stopping sequence\n5https:\/\/blog.eleuther.ai\/gpt3-model-sizes\/\nTable 1: The used trigger sentences.\n#\nTrigger Sentence\n1\n“Let’s reason the events according to the reference game”\n2\n“Let’s think step by step.”\n3\n“According to the rules of the game”\n4\n“The reference game is”\n5\n“Let’s think like a game tester”\n6\n“First,”\n7\n“Let’s think like a game designer.”\nto “Q:” to prevent repetition. We set max_tokens to 256 in\nthe ﬁrst stage and 32 in the answer extraction stage. For the\nInstructGPT models, we used the OpenAI API, and for the\nOPT models, we used the ofﬁcial implementation6, which\nprovides a similar API to what OpenAI offers. We hosted\nour OPT models on an NVIDIA DGX System with 8xA100\nGPUs (80GB) and 2 TB of system memory.\nTrigger Sentences:\nWe tested a total of seven trigger sen-\ntences, including two top-performing ones from prior work\n(Kojima et al. 2022). In particular, we included the trig-\nger sentence “Let’s think step by step”, because it has been\nshown to boost the performance of the davinci variant of In-\nstructGPT across many tasks (Kojima et al. 2022). We also\nincluded “First,” as a simple baseline (Ahn et al. 2022). We\nadded ﬁve new trigger sentences to dictate different view-\npoints and enforce the game’s rules to the language model.\nThe complete list of trigger sentences can be seen in Table 1.\nBug Type Classiﬁcation:\nIn the bug type classiﬁcation\ntask, we only feed the question and expect the model to\nchoose the correct bug types without the use of any trigger-\ning sentences.\nEvaluating the Experiments:\nFor the buggy event identi-\nﬁcation task, we calculated the accuracy for each set of de-\nscriptions separately, and report the average for all combina-\ntions of language models and trigger sentences. We also cal-\nculated the accuracy per game for the top performing model.\nTo estimate the robustness of the buggy event identiﬁcation\nunder different descriptions of the same sequence of events,\nwe used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (Woolson 2007) to\ndetermine if there was a statistically signiﬁcant difference\nbetween accuracies for each set of descriptions with the top\nperforming model. For the bug type classiﬁcation task, we\ndetermined accuracy both per bug type and on the entire\ndataset. We discuss the correctness of the reasoning of the\nmodels in the Discussion section.\nResults\nTask 1: Buggy Event Identiﬁcation\nLLMs show promising zero-shot performance for buggy\nevent identiﬁcation on our dataset. Although the accuracy\nvaries depending on the model size and trigger sentence,\nour results suggest that LLMs can be utilized for game bug\n6https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/metaseq\/\nTable 2: Breakdown of bug type classiﬁcation accuracy of\nthe davinci model (in %)\nBug Type\nCount\nAccuracy\nPlayer Animation\n28\n96.43\nTeleportation\n8\n75.00\nGraphics\n10\n70.00\n(De)Spawning\n10\n70.00\nCollision\n66\n69.70\nSpinning objects\n10\n50.00\nSliding objects\n18\n33.33\nIrregular force\n160\n24.38\nLogic\n24\n16.67\nAverage (total)\n334\n44.01\ndetection tasks. Table 3 shows the accuracy of the models\nacross the various trigger sentences and descriptions.\nThe davinci model delivers the best performance, and it\ncan achieve up to 70.66% accuracy using the ﬁrst set of de-\nscriptions (Descr1) and the trigger sentence “Let’s reason\nthe events according to the reference game”. The accuracy\naverages 65.27% across the entire dataset.\nWe ﬁnd there are no consistent trends among different\nmodels. For example, for the OPT-66 model, the trigger sen-\ntence “According to the rules of the game” leads to the best\naverage performance (40.12%).\nRobustness of Bug Detection:\nThe top performing model\nfor buggy event identiﬁcation is the davinci model, hence we\nfocus on this model while analyzing the robustness of bug\ndetection. The Wilcoxon signed rank test shows that only\ntrigger sentence #1 leads to statistically signiﬁcant differ-\nences between the different sets of descriptions. Therefore,\nthe model is fairly robust with buggy event identiﬁcation un-\nder most trigger sentences. However, sometimes the chosen\nset of descriptions can affect the accuracy.\nTask 2: Bug Type Classiﬁcation\nWe only report the performance of the davinci model for the\nbug type classiﬁcation task, as it was the best-performing\nmodel in the buggy event identiﬁcation task. Table 2 shows\nthe bug classiﬁcation accuracy per bug type. Our results\nshow that the davinci model can correctly predict the bug\ntype 44.01% of the time for our set of labelled videos. The\nmain source of misclassiﬁcation is the Irregular force bug\ntype, which is also the most frequent bug type in our dataset.\nThis type of bug is most often confused with the Collision,\nGraphics, Animation, and Teleportation bug types, which\nare all game physics bugs (with the exception of Graphics).\nThe accuracy of the model also varies considerably across\ngames. Table 4 shows the bug type classiﬁcation accuracy\nper game. The davinci model performs best on the Fallout 4\ngame. The model performs worst on the Red Dead Redemp-\ntion 2 game, and this poor performance correlates with the\nhigh proportion of Irregular force bugs (32 out of 52) for\nthis game in our dataset.\nTable 3: Breakdown of buggy event identiﬁcation accuracy by descriptions, models and trigger sentences – Bold numbers show\nthe highest performing model and trigger sentence combination (in %).\nOPT-66B\nOPT-175B\ntext-ada-001\ntext-babbage-001\ntext-curie-001\ntext-davinci-002\nTrigger\nSentences\nDescr1\nDescr2\nµ\nDescr1\nDescr2\nµ\nDescr1\nDescr2\nµ\nDescr1\nDescr2\nµ\nDescr1\nDescr2\nµ\nDescr1\nDescr2\nµ\n1\n15.57\n23.35\n19.46\n14.97\n32.93\n23.95\n31.14\n22.16\n26.65\n49.10\n29.94\n39.52\n43.11\n27.54\n35.33\n70.66\n59.88\n65.27\n2\n15.57\n31.14\n23.35\n15.57\n32.93\n24.25\n34.13\n19.16\n26.65\n49.10\n31.14\n40.12\n41.32\n29.94\n35.63\n62.87\n58.08\n60.48\n3\n48.50\n31.74\n40.12\n13.77\n31.14\n22.46\n16.17\n6.59\n11.38\n49.70\n31.74\n40.72\n41.32\n31.14\n36.23\n52.10\n58.68\n55.39\n4\n44.31\n31.14\n37.72\n16.17\n31.74\n23.95\n7.78\n2.99\n5.39\n47.90\n30.54\n39.22\n44.91\n32.34\n38.62\n52.69\n55.69\n54.19\n5\n26.95\n37.13\n32.04\n13.17\n31.14\n22.16\n27.54\n19.16\n23.35\n47.90\n32.93\n40.42\n36.53\n31.74\n34.13\n50.90\n50.90\n50.90\n6\n28.14\n29.94\n29.04\n19.16\n31.74\n25.45\n20.96\n8.98\n14.97\n49.10\n31.14\n40.12\n43.11\n29.34\n36.23\n45.51\n50.30\n47.90\n7\n22.16\n36.53\n29.34\n13.17\n31.14\n22.16\n23.35\n17.96\n20.66\n49.10\n31.74\n40.42\n39.52\n32.93\n36.23\n43.11\n50.30\n46.71\nAverage\n28.74\n31.57\n30.15\n15.14\n31.82\n23.48\n23.01\n13.86\n18.43\n48.85\n31.31\n40.08\n41.40\n30.71\n36.06\n53.98\n54.83\n54.41\nTable 4: Breakdown of accuracy of the davinci model using\ntrigger sentence #1 for buggy event identiﬁcation and bug\ntype classiﬁcation (in %).\nBuggy Event Identiﬁcation\nBug Type Classiﬁcation\nGame\n#\nDesc. 1\nDesc. 2\nµ\nDesc. 1\nDesc. 2\nµ\nFallout 4\n19\n89.47\n68.42\n78.95\n36.84\n47.37\n42.11\nCyberpunk\n23\n60.87\n82.61\n71.74\n47.83\n39.13\n43.48\nGTA V\n21\n80.95\n61.90\n71.43\n28.57\n47.62\n38.10\nWitcher 3\n21\n76.19\n57.14\n66.67\n42.86\n61.90\n52.38\nFar Cry 5\n20\n65.00\n60.00\n62.50\n55.00\n65.00\n60.00\nJust Cause 3\n17\n58.82\n64.71\n61.77\n41.18\n52.94\n47.06\nSkyrim\n20\n65.00\n50.00\n57.50\n35.00\n45.00\n40.00\nRDR 2\n26\n69.23\n38.46\n53.85\n34.62\n30.77\n32.70\nDiscussion of Failure Cases\nHere, we discuss cases in which the davinci model failed to\nidentify or reason about the buggy event correctly. In each\nsample box, the ground truth label is green, red shows the\nmodel’s wrong prediction, and the bold text shows the trig-\nger sentence and answer extraction prompt.\nWrong Reasoning and Wrong Prediction:\nFor some\nquestions, the model fails to complete the intermediate rea-\nsoning steps, with outputs being vague or wrong, leading to\nwrong answers that lack justiﬁcation. Sample 1 shows such\na case of wrong reasoning leading to a wrong prediction for\na bug7 in the Fallout 4 game.\nReasoning Does Not Match the Prediction:\nSometimes,\nthe model’s prediction is correct, but the reasoning does not\nmatch the prediction. The model follows (some) proper steps\ntoward the (correct) answer, but fails to justify it. In Sample\n2 for the GTA V game8, the model follows the events and\nexplains the ragdoll state correctly. The problem is that the\nmodel does not justify its prediction, as it does not explain\nwhy the predicted event is the bug.\nWrong Assumptions:\nIn a few cases, the steps outputted\nby the model are correct, but one or some assumptions about\nvideo games are incorrect. For example, in Sample 3 for the\nFar Cry 5 game9 the davinci model attributes a bug event to\na possible earthquake that is not present in the game.\nProblem with Reference Game:\nWe use the “The refer-\nence game is” trigger sentence to force the model to com-\n7https:\/\/redd.it\/8bspct\n8https:\/\/redd.it\/87lfze\n9https:\/\/redd.it\/88gjyp\nSample 1 – text-davinci-002\nQ: In the Fallout 4 video game, the following sequence of\nevents happened:\n(a) A super-mutant shoots a bullet at the player\n(b) The bullet collides with the player\n(c) The player dies\n(d) The player walks backwards\nWhich event is a bug?\nA:Let’s reason the events according to the reference\ngame Fallout 4:\n(a) A super-mutant shoots a bullet at the player\n(b) The bullet collides with the player\n(c) The player dies\nThe player dying is the bug here, as they should not die from\na single bullet.\nAmong (a) through (d), the answer is (c).\nSample 2 – text-davinci-002\nQ: In the Grand Theft Auto V video game, the following\nsequence of events happened:\n(a) A person is driving a car on a freeway\n(b) The person jumps out of the vehicle\n(c) The person is hit by another car and ejected into the sky\n(d) The person falls from the sky and hits the beach\nWhich event is a bug?\nA:Let’s reason the events according to the reference\ngame’s mechanics.

Manual review of the output shows that the answer ex-\ntraction prompt is not suitable for this model. Often the in-\ntermediate outputs of the model are correct, but in the second\nstage, the model outputs a wrong choice as the ﬁnal answer.\nSample 5 demonstrates that the model has correct reasoning\nfor a bug11 in the Skyrim game, but fails in the answer extrac-\ntion stage. Future studies should investigate how to resolve\nsuch issues with answer extraction.\nAutomating the Description of Event Sequences:\nOur\nprimary focus is reasoning about the events in a video game\nto detect bugs, regardless of the source of the events’ de-\nscriptions. While it is possible to incorporate a vision model\nto summarize the events in the video game, this information\n11https:\/\/redd.it\/41xesk\nSample 5 – OPT-175B\nQ: In the The Elder Scrolls V - Skyrim video game, the fol-\nlowing sequence of events happened:\n(a) A person stands in front of a monster\n(b) The monster rotates and clips through the ground\n(c) The monster falls off the cliff\n(d) The person jumps off the cliff and follows the monster\nWhich event is a bug?\nA:Let’s reason the events according to the reference\ngame.\n(a) A person stands in front of a monster\nThis is a normal event.\n(b) The monster rotates and clips through the ground\nThis is a bug.\n(c) The monster falls off the cliff\nThis is a normal event.\n(d) The person jumps off the cliff and follows the monster\nThis is a normal event.\nThe answer is (d).\nAmong (a) through (d), the answer is (d).\ncould also be obtained directly from a game engine. A game\nengine can be modiﬁed to produce both graphical and textual\noutput, which can then be used for bug detection. However,\nduring a preliminary study, we tested CLIP-Cap (Mokady,\nHertz, and Bermano 2021), ZeroCap (Tewel et al. 2022) and\nOFA (Wang et al. 2022) to create descriptions of videos, and\nfound that none of them can describe frames from video\ngames properly. Future studies should investigate how the\ndescription of event sequences can be automated.\nSearching for an Optimal Q:\nIn our dataset, it is possible\nto adapt the question template Q as long as the sequence S is\nnot changed (in contrast to other Q&A datasets which come\nwith a predeﬁned question template). Future studies should\nsearch for optimal Q formats that lead to higher accuracy.\nThis process requires a held-out set for validating the results\nto avoid possible biases. As we are interested in assessing\nthe inherent properties of language models in bug detection,\nwe did not ﬁne-tune Q in our experiments, but instead de-\nsigned a general format for all queries and video games.\nConsideration Regarding Inference’s Speed:\nAs the\nnumber of parameters in a model increases, its memory re-\nquirement and inference time also grow. Traditional tech-\nniques like layer removal (Anwar, Hwang, and Sung 2017;\nZandigohar, Erdo˘gmu¸s, and Schirner 2021) and distilla-\ntion (Hinton et al. 2015) could handle this problem, but the\nperformance may suffer. That said, Dettmers et al. (2022)\nshowed using a two-step quantization method, it is possible\nto reduce the memory footprint of a large model by 2x with-\nout performance degradation.\nConclusion\nIn this study, we demonstrated the promising capabilities\nof language models as video game bug detectors. We intro-\nduced a novel dataset of 334 question-answer pairs to exten-\nsively evaluate large language models across the OPT and\nInstructGPT families. Our results are promising but indicate\nthere are challenges in incorporating language models for\nvideo game bug detection.

Game testing is an\numbrella term for many types of tests that cover different\naspects of the game. For example, a rendering test aims to\nverify the visual quality of the output, whereas a gameplay\ntest assesses whether the game is engaging enough. While\nit is possible to automate some game testing elements, e.g.,\nby using advanced vision models to detect graphical issues\nautomatically (Taesiri, Macklon, and Bezemer 2022), most\ngame testing aspects still require a human tester (Pascarella\net al. 2018). Two of the main challenges that prevent the\nautomation of game testing are the difﬁculty to automate\n(1) knowledge about the game context and (2) common\nsense reasoning (Politowski, Petrillo, and Guéhéneuc 2021).\nMany video games rely on a physics engine that deﬁnes\nthe rules of the world in which the game is situated (Milling-\n1Source: https:\/\/redd.it\/2s5xon\na\nc\nb\nQ: In the Grand Theft Auto V video game, the following sequence of \nevents happened:\n(a) A person is parachuting in the air.\n(b) A plane approaches the parachuter.\n(c) The plane hits the cord and loses its right wing.\n(d) The plane falls from the sky.\nWhich event is a bug?\nA: The plane hitting the cord and losing its right wing is a bug.\nAmong (a) through (d), the answer is (c).\nd\nFigure 1: An example of using a large language model to\ndetect a video game bug by classifying a sequence of events\nin the Grand Theft Auto V1 video game in which a collision\nbetween a plane and parachute cords leads to the plane los-\ning its right wing. The highlighted text shows the response\nof the davinci model from the InstructGPT family.\nton 2007). For some games, there are sharp contrasts be-\ntween the game world and the natural laws of the real world.\nThese differences make it hard to reason about events in\nvideo games without knowing the game context. For exam-\nple, is it a bug that the player survives after falling from a\nvery high height? Answering such a question is impossible\nwithout having knowledge about the target video game.\nIn this study, we propose using the game context knowl-\nedge and common sense reasoning capabilities of large lan-\nguage models (LLMs) to identify buggy events in video\ngames and classify their bug type. Recent revolutions in nat-\narXiv:2210.02506v1  [cs.CL]  5 Oct 2022\nural language processing (NLP) show that scaling up lan-\nguage models is beneﬁcial in many tasks (Vaswani et al.\n2017; Devlin et al. 2018; Rae et al. 2021; Chowdhery et al.\n2022; Thoppilan et al. 2022), such as few-shot and zero-shot\nlearning (Brown et al. 2020; Kojima et al. 2022). Having\nbeen trained on very large datasets, LLMs have the poten-\ntial to capture many details about topics in their training set,\nincluding video games. Figure 1 shows an example of suc-\ncessful bug detection by a language model.\nWe are the ﬁrst to empirically evaluate the capability of\nLLMs as zero-shot video game bug detectors. Our main con-\ntributions are as follows:\n1. We present the GameBugDescriptions dataset, the\nﬁrst dataset of videos of game bugs with a step-by-\nstep textual description for bug detection purposes. This\ndataset can serve as an out-of-distribution (OOD) chal-\nlenge for LLMs.\n2. We are the ﬁrst to show that large language models have\npromising capabilities to detect video game bugs.\n3. We extensively evaluate the performance of two fami-\nlies of large language models on the bug detection and\nbug type classiﬁcation tasks: InstructGPT (Ouyang et al.\n2022) and OPT (Zhang et al. 2022).\n4. We analyze the robustness of language models to differ-\nent descriptions of the same event for these tasks.\nOur study demonstrates the promising capabilities of\nLLMs to play an important role in the automation of the\ngame testing process.\nBackground and Related Work\nOur work bridges the language modeling, video game, and\nsoftware engineering research communities. In this section,\nwe provide a brief overview of the relevant literature across\nthese disciplines, in particular, on large language models and\nprompt engineering, and automated game testing.\nLarge Language Models and Prompt Engineering\nThe training objective in a language model is to learn a prob-\nability distribution over some text corpus. Such a simple\ntraining objective combined with sufﬁcient model scaling\ncan yield large language models that are successful even for\ntasks for which the model was not explicitly trained (Ka-\nplan et al. 2020; Brown et al. 2020; Chowdhery et al. 2022;\nThoppilan et al. 2022).\nPrompting or prompt engineering (Liu et al. 2021) is an\neffective technique wherein we condition a language model\non a set of manually handcrafted (Schick and Schütze 2020;\nKojima et al. 2022) or automated (Gao, Fisch, and Chen\n2020) templates to solve new tasks. That is, new tasks can\nbe solved by giving natural language instructions to a pre-\ntrained model without any further training, e.g., by provid-\ning sample reasoning steps to the model (Wei et al. 2022) in\na few-shot setting. Moreover, Kojima et al. (2022) showed\nthat even with a prompting technique as simple as adding\n“Let’s think step by step” to the beginning of the answer, it is\npossible to trigger the reasoning in language models, which\nleads to higher accuracy improvement on multiple bench-\nmarks in zero-shot setting. Using graphical models Dohan\net al. (2022) introduced a general formulation for prompted\nmodels, enabling probabilistic programming with LLMs.\nSeveral successful applications of LLMs include program\nsynthesis (Jain et al. 2022), code generation (Chen et al.\n2021) or chatbots (Thoppilan et al. 2022). However, we are\nthe ﬁrst to apply LLMs to detect bugs in video games.\nAutomated Game Testing\nAs shown by prior work, automated game testing is chal-\nlenging because game-speciﬁc knowledge and common\nsense reasoning are required to detect and report bugs (Pas-\ncarella et al. 2018; Politowski, Petrillo, and Guéhéneuc\n2021). The majority of prior work on automated game test-\ning focuses on methods to automatically play games, such\nas heuristic search strategies (Keehl and Smith 2019). Auto-\nmated play techniques using reinforcement learning or evo-\nlutionary strategies (Zheng et al. 2019; Vinyals et al. 2019;\nBerner et al. 2019; Justesen et al. 2019) allow the testing\nof video games from different perspectives, such as playa-\nbility, game balance, and even predicting user churn rate\n(Roohi et al. 2020, 2021). However, these methods are of-\nten designed to maximize a certain reward function, which\nmight lead to progress in the game in an unintended manner\nand even break the game’s rules or physics engine (Baker\net al. 2020; Clark and Amodei 2019). More importantly,\nthese methods do not have common sense reasoning.\nOther prior work has leveraged computer vision and NLP\ntechniques for automated video game testing. Several stud-\nies have proposed approaches for graphical bug detection us-\ning deep learning (Ling, Tollmar, and Gisslén 2020; Taesiri,\nHabibi, and Fazli 2020) or digital image processing (Mack-\nlon et al. 2022). However, these approaches do not re-\nquire common sense reasoning. For example, Macklon et al.\n(2022) rely on graphical assets of the game as a test oracle.\nSeveral other studies have proposed approaches to re-\ntrieve moments from gameplay videos based on text\nqueries (Zhang and Smith 2019; Taesiri, Macklon, and Beze-\nmer 2022). However, to detect bugs with these approaches\nthe bug instance must be known in advance, and therefore\nthese gameplay event retrieval approaches do not allow for\nautomated detection of (previously undiscovered) bugs. Our\napproach does not have this requirement and can therefore\nbe used to identify previously undiscovered bugs.\nFinally, prior work has proposed NLP-based approaches\nto automatically improve test case descriptions for manual\nplaytesting of games (Viggiato et al. 2022a,b), but we are\nthe ﬁrst to leverage LLMs for bug detection in video games.\nBug Detection with Large Language Models\nTo automatically identify buggy events in a video game, we\npropose using LLMs to reason about sequences of textual\ndescriptions of game events. We formulate the problem as a\nquestion-answering (Q&A) task (Srivastava et al. 2022) for\nLLMs. Here, we explain how we convert textual descriptions\nof a sequence of game events into a multiple-choice question\nand use a language model to identify the buggy event. In ad-\ndition, we discuss how LLMs can assist us to classify the bug\nQ: Explain how the player levels up in the Skyrim \nvideo game?\nA: The player levels up by gaining experience \npoints. Experience points are gained by killing \nenemies, completing quests, and discovering \nlocations. The player can also gain experience \npoints by using a skill.\nGame Mechanics - OPT 66B\nHow does the player level up their attributes \nin the Red Dead Redemption 2 video game?\nIn Red Dead Redemption 2, the player levels \nup their attributes by completing challenges \nand tasks. These challenges and tasks can be \nfound throughout the game, and can be \ncompleted in a number of ways, such as by \nkilling enemies, completing missions, or \ntrading with merchants.

First, we motivate our methodology by demonstrating\nthe game knowledge of LLMs.\nLarge Language Models and Game Knowledge:\nTo ver-\nify whether LLMs possess game knowledge, we conducted\nan informal analysis on a set of 34 multiple-choice and 10\nfree format questions that was designed by us. The davinci\nmodel can answer 91% of the questions correctly. Figure 2\ndepicts a few cases showing language models of different\nsizes exhibiting game-speciﬁc knowledge in a zero-shot set-\nting. In the remainder of this section, we explain how we\nleverage the game knowledge of LLMs for the more chal-\nlenging task of bug detection for video games.\nProblem Formulation:\nFor a sequence S of textual\ndescriptions of events ei in a video game G (S\n=\n{e1, e2, · · · en}) we design the triplet ⟨Q, S, A⟩, in which Q\nis a question template and A is the correct answer (i.e., the\nbuggy event). By presenting S as multiple choice options\n(e.g., (a) through (d) in Figure 1), this triplet allows us to use\na language model to detect bugs in a game event sequence.\nWe leverage Q to provide context information to the lan-\nguage model. Identifying buggy events in a video game re-\nquires context, because events in a video game can be un-\nrealistic yet valid for that game. For example, in the Grand\nTheft Auto V video game, a player would die when they fall\nfrom a height, while in the Marvel’s Spider-Man game, the\nplayer would not take any damage. Therefore, we modify Q\nto include a string template G, which is a placeholder for\nthe game’s name, which is used by the language model as a\nreference point. We design each question as follows:\nIn the [G] video game, the following sequence of events\nhappened:\n[S]\nWhich event is a bug?\nMulti-Stage Prompting\nFollowing Kojima et al. (2022), we propose a two-stage\nprompting technique for eliciting reasoning in language\nmodels. This technique enables LLMs to provide step-by-\nstep reasoning for their answer, leading to higher accuracy\nand better interpretability, which allows us to debug the ﬁnal\nanswer and understand in which step the model goes wrong.\nStage 1 - Elicit Reasoning:\nSimilar to prior work (Mc-\nCann et al. 2018; Radford et al. 2019; Schick and Schütze\n2021) for each triplet ⟨Q, S, A⟩, we use a string template\n“Q: [X]. [Z]\" in which [X] is the input slot for con-\ncatenation of a question template Q containing the game\nname, and the sequence of events S. The “Q:\" text in the\ntemplate is a ﬁxed string that implies we are asking a ques-\ntion. The [Z] slot is for the trigger sentence added to the\nbeginning of the answer. The purpose of the trigger sentence\nis two-fold: (1) to assist the language model in reaching the\nanswer progressively, and (2) to inject different perspectives\nin the classiﬁcation, e.g., to see events as a game designer,\nplayer, or compared with the real world.\nWe feed the question and trigger sentence to a language\nmodel to provoke step-by-step reasoning and use the gener-\nated text in Stage 2.\nStage 2 - Answer Extraction:\nWe rely on the language\nmodel to extract the ﬁnal answer from the generated text,\ngiven the intermediate results, instead of performing text\nprocessing. To this end, we concatenate the inputs and re-\nsults from the previous stage and append an ‘answer extrac-\ntion’ prompt to the end. We can use different answer extrac-\ntion prompts depending on the format of the ﬁnal answer.\nSince we have a multiple choice format, we use the “Among\n(a) through (d), the answer is” prompt.\nBug Type Classiﬁcation\nIn addition to identifying the buggy event, classifying the\ntype of bug is helpful for bug prioritization, as described by\nTruelove, de Almeida, and Ahmed (2021). Therefore, as a\nsecondary objective, we are interested in determining if lan-\nguage models can correctly classify video game bug types.\nTo this end, we design another question template in which\nwe provide the event description and the ground truth and\nask the model to classify the type of the video game bug.\nIn the [G] video game, the following sequence of events\nhappened:\n[eb]\nWhat is the type of bug?\n[O]\nIn which O contains the bug types as multiple choice op-\ntions, and eb is the buggy event in the original sequence.\nDataset\nTo evaluate the capabilities of LLM for identifying game\nbugs, we created the GameBugDescriptions dataset, a\ncollection of videos of real game bugs. Our dataset consists\nof a collection of 167 buggy gameplay videos, each with 2\ntextual descriptions of the events in the videos, and a bug-\ntype label per video. Each description includes up to four\nsentences describing the events in the video without reason-\ning about their bugginess. To assess the robustness of lan-\nguage models to different descriptions, we provide two de-\nscriptions written by two authors for each video. Each de-\nscription is converted into a question-answering format as\nexplained above, resulting in 334 question-answer pairs. We\nalso classify all 334 descriptions into 9 different bug types.\nData Collection:\nWe start with the GamePhysics\ndataset (Taesiri, Macklon, and Bezemer 2022), a collection\nof gameplay videos from different games. Following prior\nwork (Taesiri, Macklon, and Bezemer 2022), we focus on\neight popular video games (see Table 4) from this dataset\nand sample a total of 200 videos. We deﬁne several ex-\nclusion criteria to manually ﬁlter out videos that are un-\nsuitable for our study: (1) The video does not showcase a\nbug (but instead, e.g., a funny moment or impressive play-\ning skills), (2) The video showcases a severe graphical bug\n(e.g., a glitch) and (3) The video is related to a game modiﬁ-\ncation (e.g., the contents or logic of the game were changed\nthrough manual modiﬁcation of the game ﬁles).\nLabeling:\nAfter ﬁltering, our dataset contains 167 videos,\nwith an average of 20 videos per game. Two of the authors\nlabelled each video separately without exchanging informa-\ntion during the labelling.2 Each label contains step-by-step\ntextual descriptions of events in the video without interpre-\ntation or reasoning about the events.3 The resulting dataset\ncontains a total of 334 descriptions with an average of 3.9\nsentences per video. In the rest of the paper, we denote each\nset of the descriptions as Descr1 and Descr2.\nWe also provide one bug type for each video in our\ndataset. One of the authors manually classiﬁed each video\ninto a single bug type, and another author ﬁnalized the clas-\nsiﬁcation by combining similar bug types while conﬁrming\nthat each video was suitably classiﬁed. During the classiﬁ-\ncation process, nine different bug types4 were extracted:\n• Player Animation: When the player’s body or limb is\nanimated incorrectly, such as twisted to an abnormal an-\ngle or moving uncontrollably.\n• Teleportation: An instantaneous movement of an object\nor character from one point to another.\n• Graphics: Objects or backgrounds are displayed incor-\nrectly on the screen, e.g., showing the wrong color, tex-\nture, or with the screen ﬂickering.\n• (De)Spawning: An object suddenly appears in (or disap-\npears out of) sight.\n• Collision: Objects are clipping through each other, or ob-\njects have interactions they are not supposed to have, like\nhitting an invisible wall.\n2Both authors are ﬂuent in English.\n3These authors had no access to any language model during the\nlabelling process and did not modify their labels in any way.\n4Note that several game bug taxonomies exist, however, they\nare not detailed enough to showcase the capabilities of LLM. The\npurpose of our paper is not to create a new bug taxonomy, but in-\nstead to demonstrate these capabilities.\nCyberpunk 2077\nFallout 4\nFar Cry 5\nGrand Theft Auto V\nJust Cause 3\nRed Dead Redemption 2\nThe Elder Scrolls V - Skyrim\nThe Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt\nPlayer Animation\nCollision\nGraphics\nIrregular force\nLogic\n(De)Spawning\nSliding objects\nSpinning objects\nTeleportation\n0\n2\n4\n1\n0\n0\n1\n6\n8\n3\n3\n3\n2\n6\n4\n4\n1\n2\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n9\n8\n10\n10\n10\n16\n11\n6\n3\n2\n0\n1\n3\n2\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n3\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n2\n0\n0\n1\n3\n2\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\nFigure 3: Distribution of bug types across games in the\nGameBugDescriptions dataset.\n• Spinning objects: An object is rotating without force be-\ning exerted on it.\n• Sliding objects: An object is sliding on the ground as if\nthere is little or no friction.\n• Irregular force: An object is acted upon by a force in a\nway that disobeys the game’s physics, such as an object\nsuddenly starting to ﬂoat.\n• Logic: Non-player characters (NPCs) do things that\nseem illogical, such as an ambulance driving on the side-\nwalk or running over pedestrians.\nThe Irregular force type is the most common bug type\namong all videos. Figure 3 shows the distribution of bug\ntypes in GameBugDescriptions dataset.\nAverage CLIP Score:\nTo estimate the similarity between\nthe descriptions and videos (and hence the quality of the de-\nscriptions), we calculated the CLIP Score (Radford et al.\n2021) between each sentence in the event description and\nall frames in the video. We record the maximum similarity\namong frames for each sentence and report the average score\nfor all sentences as a ﬁnal score. The median CLIP Score\nfor all 334 video descriptions in our dataset is 0.30, which\nhas been previously used as a reasonable similarity thresh-\nold (Schuhmann et al. 2021) based on human inspection.\nExperimental Setup\nWe executed two tasks in our experiments: (1) buggy event\nidentiﬁcation and (2) bug type classiﬁcation. In this section,\nwe discuss the experimental setup.\nModels:\nWe tested six models from the InstructGPT\n(Ouyang et al. 2022) and OPT (Zhang et al. 2022) fami-\nlies of models. We tested all four InstructGPT models (ada,\nbabbage, curie and davinci), which contain 0.3B to 175B pa-\nrameters5. We also ran our experiments on OPT models with\n66B and 175B parameters. In all experiments, we set the\ntemperature parameter to 0, and the stopping sequence\n5https:\/\/blog.eleuther.ai\/gpt3-model-sizes\/\nTable 1: The used trigger sentences.\n#\nTrigger Sentence\n1\n“Let’s reason the events according to the reference game”\n2\n“Let’s think step by step.”\n3\n“According to the rules of the game”\n4\n“The reference game is”\n5\n“Let’s think like a game tester”\n6\n“First,”\n7\n“Let’s think like a game designer.”\nto “Q:” to prevent repetition. We set max_tokens to 256 in\nthe ﬁrst stage and 32 in the answer extraction stage. For the\nInstructGPT models, we used the OpenAI API, and for the\nOPT models, we used the ofﬁcial implementation6, which\nprovides a similar API to what OpenAI offers. We hosted\nour OPT models on an NVIDIA DGX System with 8xA100\nGPUs (80GB) and 2 TB of system memory.\nTrigger Sentences:\nWe tested a total of seven trigger sen-\ntences, including two top-performing ones from prior work\n(Kojima et al. 2022). In particular, we included the trig-\nger sentence “Let’s think step by step”, because it has been\nshown to boost the performance of the davinci variant of In-\nstructGPT across many tasks (Kojima et al. 2022). We also\nincluded “First,” as a simple baseline (Ahn et al. 2022). We\nadded ﬁve new trigger sentences to dictate different view-\npoints and enforce the game’s rules to the language model.\nThe complete list of trigger sentences can be seen in Table 1.\nBug Type Classiﬁcation:\nIn the bug type classiﬁcation\ntask, we only feed the question and expect the model to\nchoose the correct bug types without the use of any trigger-\ning sentences.\nEvaluating the Experiments:\nFor the buggy event identi-\nﬁcation task, we calculated the accuracy for each set of de-\nscriptions separately, and report the average for all combina-\ntions of language models and trigger sentences. We also cal-\nculated the accuracy per game for the top performing model.\nTo estimate the robustness of the buggy event identiﬁcation\nunder different descriptions of the same sequence of events,\nwe used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (Woolson 2007) to\ndetermine if there was a statistically signiﬁcant difference\nbetween accuracies for each set of descriptions with the top\nperforming model. For the bug type classiﬁcation task, we\ndetermined accuracy both per bug type and on the entire\ndataset. We discuss the correctness of the reasoning of the\nmodels in the Discussion section.\nResults\nTask 1: Buggy Event Identiﬁcation\nLLMs show promising zero-shot performance for buggy\nevent identiﬁcation on our dataset. Although the accuracy\nvaries depending on the model size and trigger sentence,\nour results suggest that LLMs can be utilized for game bug\n6https:\/\/github.com\/facebookresearch\/metaseq\/\nTable 2: Breakdown of bug type classiﬁcation accuracy of\nthe davinci model (in %)\nBug Type\nCount\nAccuracy\nPlayer Animation\n28\n96.43\nTeleportation\n8\n75.00\nGraphics\n10\n70.00\n(De)Spawning\n10\n70.00\nCollision\n66\n69.70\nSpinning objects\n10\n50.00\nSliding objects\n18\n33.33\nIrregular force\n160\n24.38\nLogic\n24\n16.67\nAverage (total)\n334\n44.01\ndetection tasks. Table 3 shows the accuracy of the models\nacross the various trigger sentences and descriptions.\nThe davinci model delivers the best performance, and it\ncan achieve up to 70.66% accuracy using the ﬁrst set of de-\nscriptions (Descr1) and the trigger sentence “Let’s reason\nthe events according to the reference game”. The accuracy\naverages 65.27% across the entire dataset.\nWe ﬁnd there are no consistent trends among different\nmodels. For example, for the OPT-66 model, the trigger sen-\ntence “According to the rules of the game” leads to the best\naverage performance (40.12%).\nRobustness of Bug Detection:\nThe top performing model\nfor buggy event identiﬁcation is the davinci model, hence we\nfocus on this model while analyzing the robustness of bug\ndetection. The Wilcoxon signed rank test shows that only\ntrigger sentence #1 leads to statistically signiﬁcant differ-\nences between the different sets of descriptions. Therefore,\nthe model is fairly robust with buggy event identiﬁcation un-\nder most trigger sentences. However, sometimes the chosen\nset of descriptions can affect the accuracy.\nTask 2: Bug Type Classiﬁcation\nWe only report the performance of the davinci model for the\nbug type classiﬁcation task, as it was the best-performing\nmodel in the buggy event identiﬁcation task. Table 2 shows\nthe bug classiﬁcation accuracy per bug type. Our results\nshow that the davinci model can correctly predict the bug\ntype 44.01% of the time for our set of labelled videos. The\nmain source of misclassiﬁcation is the Irregular force bug\ntype, which is also the most frequent bug type in our dataset.\nThis type of bug is most often confused with the Collision,\nGraphics, Animation, and Teleportation bug types, which\nare all game physics bugs (with the exception of Graphics).\nThe accuracy of the model also varies considerably across\ngames. Table 4 shows the bug type classiﬁcation accuracy\nper game. The davinci model performs best on the Fallout 4\ngame. The model performs worst on the Red Dead Redemp-\ntion 2 game, and this poor performance correlates with the\nhigh proportion of Irregular force bugs (32 out of 52) for\nthis game in our dataset.\nTable 3: Breakdown of buggy event identiﬁcation accuracy by descriptions, models and trigger sentences – Bold numbers show\nthe highest performing model and trigger sentence combination (in %).\nOPT-66B\nOPT-175B\ntext-ada-001\ntext-babbage-001\ntext-curie-001\ntext-davinci-002\nTrigger\nSentences\nDescr1\nDescr2\nµ\nDescr1\nDescr2\nµ\nDescr1\nDescr2\nµ\nDescr1\nDescr2\nµ\nDescr1\nDescr2\nµ\nDescr1\nDescr2\nµ\n1\n15.57\n23.35\n19.46\n14.97\n32.93\n23.95\n31.14\n22.16\n26.65\n49.10\n29.94\n39.52\n43.11\n27.54\n35.33\n70.66\n59.88\n65.27\n2\n15.57\n31.14\n23.35\n15.57\n32.93\n24.25\n34.13\n19.16\n26.65\n49.10\n31.14\n40.12\n41.32\n29.94\n35.63\n62.87\n58.08\n60.48\n3\n48.50\n31.74\n40.12\n13.77\n31.14\n22.46\n16.17\n6.59\n11.38\n49.70\n31.74\n40.72\n41.32\n31.14\n36.23\n52.10\n58.68\n55.39\n4\n44.31\n31.14\n37.72\n16.17\n31.74\n23.95\n7.78\n2.99\n5.39\n47.90\n30.54\n39.22\n44.91\n32.34\n38.62\n52.69\n55.69\n54.19\n5\n26.95\n37.13\n32.04\n13.17\n31.14\n22.16\n27.54\n19.16\n23.35\n47.90\n32.93\n40.42\n36.53\n31.74\n34.13\n50.90\n50.90\n50.90\n6\n28.14\n29.94\n29.04\n19.16\n31.74\n25.45\n20.96\n8.98\n14.97\n49.10\n31.14\n40.12\n43.11\n29.34\n36.23\n45.51\n50.30\n47.90\n7\n22.16\n36.53\n29.34\n13.17\n31.14\n22.16\n23.35\n17.96\n20.66\n49.10\n31.74\n40.42\n39.52\n32.93\n36.23\n43.11\n50.30\n46.71\nAverage\n28.74\n31.57\n30.15\n15.14\n31.82\n23.48\n23.01\n13.86\n18.43\n48.85\n31.31\n40.08\n41.40\n30.71\n36.06\n53.98\n54.83\n54.41\nTable 4: Breakdown of accuracy of the davinci model using\ntrigger sentence #1 for buggy event identiﬁcation and bug\ntype classiﬁcation (in %).\nBuggy Event Identiﬁcation\nBug Type Classiﬁcation\nGame\n#\nDesc. 1\nDesc. 2\nµ\nDesc. 1\nDesc. 2\nµ\nFallout 4\n19\n89.47\n68.42\n78.95\n36.84\n47.37\n42.11\nCyberpunk\n23\n60.87\n82.61\n71.74\n47.83\n39.13\n43.48\nGTA V\n21\n80.95\n61.90\n71.43\n28.57\n47.62\n38.10\nWitcher 3\n21\n76.19\n57.14\n66.67\n42.86\n61.90\n52.38\nFar Cry 5\n20\n65.00\n60.00\n62.50\n55.00\n65.00\n60.00\nJust Cause 3\n17\n58.82\n64.71\n61.77\n41.18\n52.94\n47.06\nSkyrim\n20\n65.00\n50.00\n57.50\n35.00\n45.00\n40.00\nRDR 2\n26\n69.23\n38.46\n53.85\n34.62\n30.77\n32.70\nDiscussion of Failure Cases\nHere, we discuss cases in which the davinci model failed to\nidentify or reason about the buggy event correctly. In each\nsample box, the ground truth label is green, red shows the\nmodel’s wrong prediction, and the bold text shows the trig-\nger sentence and answer extraction prompt.\nWrong Reasoning and Wrong Prediction:\nFor some\nquestions, the model fails to complete the intermediate rea-\nsoning steps, with outputs being vague or wrong, leading to\nwrong answers that lack justiﬁcation. Sample 1 shows such\na case of wrong reasoning leading to a wrong prediction for\na bug7 in the Fallout 4 game.\nReasoning Does Not Match the Prediction:\nSometimes,\nthe model’s prediction is correct, but the reasoning does not\nmatch the prediction. The model follows (some) proper steps\ntoward the (correct) answer, but fails to justify it. In Sample\n2 for the GTA V game8, the model follows the events and\nexplains the ragdoll state correctly. The problem is that the\nmodel does not justify its prediction, as it does not explain\nwhy the predicted event is the bug.\nWrong Assumptions:\nIn a few cases, the steps outputted\nby the model are correct, but one or some assumptions about\nvideo games are incorrect. For example, in Sample 3 for the\nFar Cry 5 game9 the davinci model attributes a bug event to\na possible earthquake that is not present in the game.\nProblem with Reference Game:\nWe use the “The refer-\nence game is” trigger sentence to force the model to com-\n7https:\/\/redd.it\/8bspct\n8https:\/\/redd.it\/87lfze\n9https:\/\/redd.it\/88gjyp\nSample 1 – text-davinci-002\nQ: In the Fallout 4 video game, the following sequence of\nevents happened:\n(a) A super-mutant shoots a bullet at the player\n(b) The bullet collides with the player\n(c) The player dies\n(d) The player walks backwards\nWhich event is a bug?\nA:Let’s reason the events according to the reference\ngame Fallout 4:\n(a) A super-mutant shoots a bullet at the player\n(b) The bullet collides with the player\n(c) The player dies\nThe player dying is the bug here, as they should not die from\na single bullet.\nAmong (a) through (d), the answer is (c).\nSample 2 – text-davinci-002\nQ: In the Grand Theft Auto V video game, the following\nsequence of events happened:\n(a) A person is driving a car on a freeway\n(b) The person jumps out of the vehicle\n(c) The person is hit by another car and ejected into the sky\n(d) The person falls from the sky and hits the beach\nWhich event is a bug?\nA:Let’s reason the events according to the reference\ngame’s mechanics. In GTA V, when a player exits a vehi-\ncle while it’s still in motion, the character will automatically\nenter a “ragdol” state and fall to the ground. If the player is\nthen hit by another vehicle while in this ragdoll state, they\nwill be ejected into the air. So event (c) is the bug here.\npare the events within the context of the desired game. Sur-\nprisingly, in some cases, this leads to the model complain-\ning about the absence of reference games. Sample 4 for the\nGTA V game10 shows an example of the model failing to\nrecognize the provided reference game.\n10https:\/\/redd.it\/2x16in\nSample 3 – text-davinci-002\nQ: In the Far Cry 5 video game, the following sequence of\nevents happened:\n(a) A person approaches the exit of a building\n(b) The door is shaking violently at the exit\n(c) The person is launched into the sky by the door\n(d) The person falls back to the ground and is killed\nWhich event is a bug?\nA:Let’s reason the events according to the reference\ngame’s logic:\n(a) A person approaches the exit of a building - this is ﬁne\n(b) The door is shaking violently at the exit - this is probably\ndue to some kind of earthquake or explosion\n(c) The person is launched into the sky by the door - this is\na bug, because there is no in-game logic that would explain\nwhy the door would suddenly launch the person into the sky\n(d) The person falls back to the ground and is killed - this is\nﬁne, because it is a natural consequence of being launched\ninto the sky and then falling back down to the ground\nAmong (a) through (d), the answer is (c).\nSample 4 – text-davinci-002\nQ: In the Grand Theft Auto V video game, the following\nsequence of events happened:\n(a) A bus is on a road\n(b) The bus is rotating about a vertical axis on the road\n(c) The rotating bus collides with a person\n(d) The person is knocked to the ground\nWhich event is a bug?\nA:The reference game is not provided so it is difﬁcult to\nsay which event is a bug.\nAmong (a) through (d), the answer is most likely (c).\nFuture Research Directions\nImproving the Poor Performance of OPT-175B:\nThe\nbiggest model in the OPT family achieves a low accuracy,\neven compared to a smaller model of the same family, OPT-\n66B. Manual review of the output shows that the answer ex-\ntraction prompt is not suitable for this model. Often the in-\ntermediate outputs of the model are correct, but in the second\nstage, the model outputs a wrong choice as the ﬁnal answer.\nSample 5 demonstrates that the model has correct reasoning\nfor a bug11 in the Skyrim game, but fails in the answer extrac-\ntion stage. Future studies should investigate how to resolve\nsuch issues with answer extraction.\nAutomating the Description of Event Sequences:\nOur\nprimary focus is reasoning about the events in a video game\nto detect bugs, regardless of the source of the events’ de-\nscriptions. While it is possible to incorporate a vision model\nto summarize the events in the video game, this information\n11https:\/\/redd.it\/41xesk\nSample 5 – OPT-175B\nQ: In the The Elder Scrolls V - Skyrim video game, the fol-\nlowing sequence of events happened:\n(a) A person stands in front of a monster\n(b) The monster rotates and clips through the ground\n(c) The monster falls off the cliff\n(d) The person jumps off the cliff and follows the monster\nWhich event is a bug?\nA:Let’s reason the events according to the reference\ngame.\n(a) A person stands in front of a monster\nThis is a normal event.\n(b) The monster rotates and clips through the ground\nThis is a bug.\n(c) The monster falls off the cliff\nThis is a normal event.\n(d) The person jumps off the cliff and follows the monster\nThis is a normal event.\nThe answer is (d).\nAmong (a) through (d), the answer is (d).\ncould also be obtained directly from a game engine. A game\nengine can be modiﬁed to produce both graphical and textual\noutput, which can then be used for bug detection. However,\nduring a preliminary study, we tested CLIP-Cap (Mokady,\nHertz, and Bermano 2021), ZeroCap (Tewel et al. 2022) and\nOFA (Wang et al. 2022) to create descriptions of videos, and\nfound that none of them can describe frames from video\ngames properly. Future studies should investigate how the\ndescription of event sequences can be automated.\nSearching for an Optimal Q:\nIn our dataset, it is possible\nto adapt the question template Q as long as the sequence S is\nnot changed (in contrast to other Q&A datasets which come\nwith a predeﬁned question template). Future studies should\nsearch for optimal Q formats that lead to higher accuracy.\nThis process requires a held-out set for validating the results\nto avoid possible biases. As we are interested in assessing\nthe inherent properties of language models in bug detection,\nwe did not ﬁne-tune Q in our experiments, but instead de-\nsigned a general format for all queries and video games.\nConsideration Regarding Inference’s Speed:\nAs the\nnumber of parameters in a model increases, its memory re-\nquirement and inference time also grow. Traditional tech-\nniques like layer removal (Anwar, Hwang, and Sung 2017;\nZandigohar, Erdo˘gmu¸s, and Schirner 2021) and distilla-\ntion (Hinton et al. 2015) could handle this problem, but the\nperformance may suffer. That said, Dettmers et al. (2022)\nshowed using a two-step quantization method, it is possible\nto reduce the memory footprint of a large model by 2x with-\nout performance degradation.\nConclusion\nIn this study, we demonstrated the promising capabilities\nof language models as video game bug detectors. We intro-\nduced a novel dataset of 334 question-answer pairs to exten-\nsively evaluate large language models across the OPT and\nInstructGPT families. Our results are promising but indicate\nthere are challenges in incorporating language models for\nvideo game bug detection. In summary, we have provided\na new out-of-distribution task for benchmarking large lan-\nguage models, and we hope to motivate researchers from\nboth the AI and software engineering communities to fur-\nther explore this promising and exciting new direction of\nautomated video game testing.\n```\n\n#### 5. 学生问题\n问题1：介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」\n问题2：这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？\n问题3：这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？\n\n\n请输出论文总结\n### 输出格式（输出语言用中文）\n```\n## 💡 解答问题1 (...复述学生问题1...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (...复述学生问题2...)\n...\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (...复述学生问题3...)\n...\n```\n","llm_summary_res":"## 🌟 论文解读 | 大型语言模型在零样本视频游戏漏洞检测中的潜力\n\n## 📌 背景痛点\/本文动机\n视频游戏测试需要游戏特定的知识和对游戏事件的常识推理。虽然 AI 驱动的代理可以满足第一个要求，但自动满足第二个要求仍然不可能。因此，视频游戏测试通常仍然依赖于手动测试，需要人类测试者彻底地玩游戏来检测漏洞。这使得完全自动化游戏测试具有挑战性。\n\n## 🚀 核心方法\n💡 创新点1：将漏洞检测问题表述为问答任务，利用大型语言模型的零样本能力来识别游戏事件序列中的漏洞事件。\n💡 创新点2：引入 GameBugDescriptions 基准数据集，包含 167 个有漏洞的游戏玩法视频和 334 个问答对，涵盖 8 个游戏。\n💡 创新点3：在基准数据集上评估了 OPT 和 InstructGPT 大型语言模型家族的六个模型的性能。\n💡 创新点4：分析了语言模型对不同事件描述的鲁棒性。\n\n## 📈 实验结果\n实验结果表明，大型语言模型在视频游戏漏洞检测方面具有很大的潜力。通过适当的提示技术，可以实现 70.66% 的准确率，在某些视频游戏中甚至可以达到 78.94%。\n\n## 💬 可借鉴之处\n这篇论文展示了大型语言模型在视频游戏漏洞检测方面的潜力，为自动化游戏测试提供了新的思路。此外，论文中提出的 GameBugDescriptions 基准数据集可以用于评估和比较不同语言模型在漏洞检测任务上的性能。","llm_summary_res_status":200,"order":34,"query_answer":"## 💡 解答问题1 (介绍这篇论文「提出的benchmark」，或者这篇论文「该方法进行实验的benchmark」)\n这篇论文提出了一个名为 GameBugDescriptions 的基准数据集，用于评估大型语言模型在视频游戏漏洞检测方面的能力。该数据集包含 167 个有漏洞的游戏玩法视频和 334 个问答对，涵盖 8 个游戏。每个视频都有两个由不同作者撰写的文本描述，每个描述都包含对视频事件的描述，但没有对事件是否为漏洞进行推理。此外，每个视频都被标记为 9 种不同的漏洞类型之一。\n\n## 💡 解答问题2 (这个benchmark需要什么设备条件? 例如：需要什么机器（多少GPU，多少内存）等。本文的模型 训练和推理分别使用了什么设备？)\n论文中提到，他们使用了 NVIDIA DGX System，配备了 8 个 A100 GPU（每个 80GB）和 2TB 的系统内存来运行 OPT 模型。对于 InstructGPT 模型，他们使用了 OpenAI API。在实验中，他们设置了温度参数为 0，停止序列为 \"Q:\"，以防止重复，并在第一阶段和答案提取阶段分别设置了 max_tokens 为 256 和 32。\n\n## 💡 解答问题3 (这个benchmark的环境，是否有一个高质量的结果奖励或者过程奖励，从而不容易reward hacking，从而支持RL类模型在这个benchmark上大放异彩？)\n论文中没有明确提到 GameBugDescriptions 基准数据集是否包含奖励机制，也没有提到该数据集是否支持强化学习（RL）类模型。然而，由于该数据集旨在评估大型语言模型在视频游戏漏洞检测方面的能力，因此它可能更适合评估语言模型而非强化学习模型。","query_answer_status":200}
